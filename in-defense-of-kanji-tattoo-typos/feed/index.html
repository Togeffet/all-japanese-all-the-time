					<description><![CDATA[Her tattoo is the name Aiko. That&#039;s what a Japanese person would recognize when looking at these characters. There is no word for beloved child that uses those characters, just the name Aiko. And the caption is making fun of the fact that this gaijin has the name Aiko tattooed on herself when her name is most definitely not Aiko. Who would tattoo their own name on themselves anyway? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you can laugh at me all you want, just tell me what&#039;s so funny. 
someone has &quot;beloved child&quot; tattooed on their skin... maybe that&#039;s silly and maybe they meant something slightly different but I don&#039;t see why it&#039;s funny. is it because it&#039;s also the name of someone famous such as.. a certain princess? still doesn&#039;t strike me as a big deal.

					<description><![CDATA[I like this post. I like it because even though i don&#039;t make fun of people a lot,
i might, one day, want to make fun of someone who has a tatoo of a stupid kanji,
or a tatoo with kanjis with typos.

This post reminds me that even though i may know a few kanjis, there is no need
for me to be a smart ass about it.

And this lesson also applies to everything else.¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this article reminds me...
I once met a dude who had a string of hiragana on his inner arm. I couldn&#039;t quite make it out because he wouldn&#039;t sit still in a way that&#039;d let me see it so I asked him what it was about. 
he happily told me it was the date of his wedding. his wife had the exact same tattoo. turns out way back when he typed in the date in word and converted it to some random font. he didn&#039;t even know they were Japanese syllables or that they couldn&#039;t possibly mean numbers on their own. (he even thought a dakuten meant a dash in the date) I tried my hardest not to laugh at his stupidity.
I don&#039;t see what&#039;s wrong with the kanji-tattoo in the picture though. anyone willing to elucidate?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, the only time I see people talking about Kanji tattoos is when someone comes to ask advice on getting one, and it&#039;s not so much &#039;making fun of&#039; as ... viciously discouraging the very idea. I think the anti-tattoo attitude of the Japanese rubs off on people studying the language or something. Perhaps character-tattoo seeking westerners would have better luck talking to learners of Chinese, I don&#039;t know... 
But, honestly, the only reason that the Japanese don&#039;t tattoo &#039;exotic&#039; English phrases all over their bodies is exactly because of that whole yakuza/tattoo prejudicial attitude going on. They slap incorrect and incoherent exotic occidental phrases all over everything else, though! I kinda like the T-shirts with nonsensical phrases on them that so many anime and dorama characters wear. I&#039;ve heard that the tattoo prejudice is weakening anyway, so maybe there will be prevalent exotic western phrase tattoos in a few more years (or decades... )
