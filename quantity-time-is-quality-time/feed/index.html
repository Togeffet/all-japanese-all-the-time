					<description><![CDATA[Learning languages is like growing hair, if you kind of look at it this way.

We just make sure that we eat and our hair grows &#039;x&#039; mm  daily, without us noticing anything.

We just make sure we show up to Japanese and our skill gets better daily, without us noticing anything.

And before we know it, we have to get our hair cut .
Before we know it, we start swearing in Japanese.
Before we know it, we start laughing at a joke in Gintama.
Before we know it, girls leave the room, because they want to talk about their period and they know that we&#039;ll understand.

I know it&#039;s not the best example but it sure gave me a clear image. All we&#039;ve basically got to do is water the plants, boil the water. Nature will take care of the rest. That&#039;s why I love the new Dragon Ash song &#039;Lily&#039;, it kind of sings about this haha. The process of how a flower gets to bloom. Learning Japanese is in big actually the same.
