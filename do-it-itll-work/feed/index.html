					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] And neither will lack of knowledge &#8212; if, that is, you respect the kind that you yourself generate. Knowledge isn&#8217;t just something people give you in school; it&#8217;s something you can and do produce on your own; it emerges from experience. But you don&#8217;t pay it any notice or respect when it comes from you, because you respect nothing that comes out of you; whether from the front of the body or the back, it&#8217;s all just crap to you. Yet as soon as some bimbo who can enunciate reads it to you and it&#8217;s called &#8220;news&#8221;, suddenly you respect it. And this is why you&#8217;re forced to read and hear people like me telling you your own good ideas &#8230; [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Immersion is a crazy idea. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an idea that few people have had; I think many people have had the idea, but only a relative few have been mad enough, Glaswegian-accented enough &#8212; Spartan enough &#8212; to try it. Turn all your TV and movies and music and computing devices and websites Japanese? It&#8217;s kind of insane in its brutally straightforward logic: all Japanese people (and non-Japanese people) who are good at Japanese have been and remain exposed to Japanese; I want to be good at Japanese; I will expose myself to Japanese to the same extent as them. But it works and then people think you&#8217;re a genius and accuse you of having a genetic talent &#8212; a &#8220;gift&#8221;. From whom? We don&#8217;t know. And why do these gifts seem to have to be worked for? Conveniently, we don&#8217;t know. [...]]]></description>
