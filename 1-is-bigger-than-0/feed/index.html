					<description><![CDATA[This post kinda goes against the &quot;10,000 hours&quot; one you did. I gues the 10,000 hours of listeing are for people who are &quot;serious&quot; about Japanese, where else this is more about people who usually complain they dont have no time and people who are scared to put a foot forawrd at a time. As for me, I am studying at fast but steady rate. I am a;ready much better than probably anyone in my college who studies Japanese. Butg I listen to All Japanese and novles at least 20 hours a day, while leraning 64 new kanji a month and 16 new grammer points and 10 new particles a month. And I am not tired or wear, in fact. The more I study, the mre I love Japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know, before I started studying Japanese all the time, I used to be quite a runner.  And the only problem with being a runner is that you become a better runner.  Like at first, running a mile is hard.  Then running two miles is hard.  But if you keep at it, pretty soon you&#039;re clocking six miles a day.  And then more.  That&#039;s just the way it is.  You get good at things.  What a mess.
Who wants to be good at stuff?  Being talented takes up all your time!  Pretty soon you&#039;re knocking out 90 minute workouts.  And while that&#039;s cool, it also feels pretty daunting.  I remember so many early mornings when I was like, Jeez, it&#039;s raining, do I really have to go out for an hour and a half?  And I did then what I do now in Japanese.  I let myself off the hook.  I said, Okay fine, I&#039;ll only go out for 20 minutes.  Just a quick jog.  Mentally, that&#039;s waaay easier to deal with.  And invariably, once I ran 20 minutes, I&#039;d feel pretty good and just keep going.  It&#039;s the same thing now.  The hardest thing is just doing something small, getting out the door.  Once you do that, you&#039;ve got momentum, and it&#039;s a lot easier to continue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Allow me to go slightly off-topic here...

I recently had to stop doing well... about anything in Japanese, due to my computer breaking down (funny how much depends on a machine, huh?). According to Anki, the break has been 1.2 months. Wow. Maybe I haven&#039;t done that much learning beforehand (just RTK and about 350 words in Core2k), but I got rather used to at least doing Anki reps every day and during that time without a computer I really felt... bad, without being able to study. 

I&#039;d say it&#039;s a success - I got addicted to Japanese! But still, whenever I think of this language I feel like I&#039;m standing at the bottom of Mount Everest with a guidebook in hand but no equipment or training. In other words, I have theoretical knowledge of what I should do to climb the mountain (learn the language), but I feel completely lost when trying to apply that to real life. 

Okay, maybe that&#039;s not the best metaphor, but you get what I mean. Nevertheless, AJATT and similar sites give me hope that someday, I will succeed and my dream of being able to speak and understand Japanese will come true.  ]]></description>
