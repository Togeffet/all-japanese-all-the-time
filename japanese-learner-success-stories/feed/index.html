					<description><![CDATA[Love the Oscar Wilde quote (but then, all his quotes are great). This was a realization I had come to myself some time ago.

After living such a long time with a skewed, mystical view of the &#039;Orient,&#039; I found it hard to shake that stereotype after coming to Japan.

Now that I can understand what people around me are saying, I&#039;ve realized that, like many Americans back home, they actually have very little interesting to say.

Kinda kills some of the excitement of learning the language. It hasn&#039;t stopped me from studying Japanese or living in Japan - but it does lead me to chuckle sometimes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like every Spanish song has &quot;corazon&quot; in there somewhere...

It seems that a lot of the words in J-pop aren&#039;t necessarily the ones I hear people using, so I was really wondering if listening to songs aids with fluency, or if they are enjoyable (to some) but not that useful for teaching.  Opinions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I reckon that if you arm yourself with the following words you can tackle 50% of J-Pop. I guess it&#039;d be easy to make a list of overused words in English language music too, but these are the ones that seem to pop up all the time in the stuff I&#039;ve heard: 掌、光、耀く、足跡、闇、繰り返す etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was typing up a large &quot;in process&quot; story. However, I&#039;ve been posting my steps in this blog&#039;s comment area over the last year, so no need to repeat it. I don&#039;t consider myself a success yet as I&#039;m still learning. I&#039;ve &quot;lived&quot; in Japan since January 2007. I use quotations since I&#039;m in the US Navy. The base I work (and live on) is NOT Japan, plus I travel 6 months out of the year (no mandatory immersion for me). I&#039;m done with RTK1 (25k reviews on RevTK) which I started in July, 2007 and finished on Dec, 2007. I&#039;m only 700 sentences in the sentence method which I started in January 2008. Again, full time job aboard a US Navy ship (no walking around with iPods in my ears for me, no televisions constantly on a Japanese program, etc.). Still, I made do.

It&#039;s been a constant learning experience. For me, it&#039;s been about finding the most efficient manner to learn Japanese. In the process, I&#039;ve found out so much about languages, learning, memory, motivation, techniques, etc that can be applied to many areas of life. If anything, I learned do not be afraid to try something new to see if it works for you. DO NOT take a &quot;this is the only way&quot; mentality either. Some people just react differently to learning methods than others. I find that as long as your methods are diverse, the weaknesses in one method is covered by the strengths of others.

For success, I&#039;ll be honest - Karaoke. I love it. I love going to a karaoke bar, hitting a song just right and hearing the crowd go nuts. Well, now I&#039;m doing Japanese songs. I&#039;m not &quot;memorizing&quot; them and pretending to read. No, I MUST read the darn screen in order to sing it. The more I get into the sentence method, the more I&#039;m able to read Karaoke. I will add, I&#039;m not learning Japanese from Karaoke. I find that singing Japanese is fun, and I can sing more if I learn more Japanese. Heck, I&#039;m even considering &quot;mining&quot; songs so I got a bit more understanding of what I&#039;m singing. In case you&#039;re wondering (Yuzu - Harukaze, Ken Hirai - Kimi no Sukina Toko, Crazy Ken Band - Tiger and Dragon, Fukuyama - Tokyo Ni Mo Attanda, &quot;one more time, one more chance&quot;), yeah not much, but I can hit it.

For what I wished I had up front: pre-made sentence packs. Yeah, many advocate making your own, but I disagree. So long as you study the sentences prior to putting them in an SRS, add in appropriate definitions (J-E then J-J later) and notes, you&#039;ve put in the leg work. However, with the pre-made packs, I was putting in more sentences. I procrastinated when I had to type them in manually. Besides, it was RevTK (a group effort website, no doubt) that got me through RTK. Therefore, a sentence pack getting me through Understanding Basic Japanese Grammar and Kanji.Odyssey.2001 I&#039;m not going to ignore for a nobler but less efficient ideal. Plus, that&#039;s just to get the basics down. You&#039;ll move on to your own sentences in time.

Ok, longer than I thought. Keep up the great works.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unrelated question.

I want to put a JP OS on my computer but I am unsure how to do it.  I thinkg I remember reading a post about it here but I was unable to find it through searching, so if anyone has any helpful advice that would be great.

Where can I get a JP OS? torrents?
Do I need a special keyboard?  Or can I just label my current one once I get the OS installed and find out what keys are what.

And then I have a general JP computer typing question.  How can someone type japanese fast?  Like I said I use the IME pad and when I type out the words in kana then hit tab it pops out a kanji and then a list of other possible kanji, it almost never displays the kanji I want, so I&#039;m just wondering how someone can be typing japanese at 70 words/min, or does it just take practice? or are their keyboards different?

thanks

					<description><![CDATA[By the way, this question popped out because I have a friend that was influenced (quite uncounsciously) by my Japanese environment so he also wants to learn Japanese. I was encouraging him but now I&#039;m a little bit worried about him because he has no computer at home and the computer is the only way to get to Japanese things here. Therefore, I&#039;m really worried. :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Khatz!
I&#039;ve been thinking (you probably wouldn&#039;t like, that :) ) and after reading your posts, I came to the conclusion that INPUT is the key to fluency in this method like you had pointed at some article (I think it was something about showing up). I&#039;m not getting new input lately(new music, movies, dramas) and as a result all the things I already have are boring me, like watching the same Naruto movie for the 100th time. So I was thinking: &quot;OK, I at least have some input, I may be bored, be unable to obtain more input but hey I got input after all&quot;. But what would you say to someone who just can&#039;t get input no matter how hard he/she tries?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jair Trejo; there are lots of random number generators on the internet and currently existing text-to-speech can read digits into numbers.

					<description><![CDATA[Alec, John B: Silly me, I haven&#039;t  realized you could input numbers directly in that page. It is definitely a great resource. Thank you very much!

I tought I might write a program the generates random numbers, and make the Text-to-Speech software in my computer to read them aloud for me. It would spare me the cumbersome task of writing the numbers in the page, but unfortunately I&#039;d have to write the Number to Words translation software myself. I wonder if there is something like that already done?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John B that site is great! Khatzumoto might want to link that site to the post regarding using dictation of sentences in the SRS. All you need is a free audio ripper and you&#039;ve got a native speaker for your sentences without dropping a dime!

Now for a strange question. And this kind of relates to this post in that it is a small success story. I started watching the Tiger and Dragon series. I&#039;ve watched the first episode and most of the prequel episode. My Japanese has gotten good enough over the last 7 months that I can understand and/or get the gist of most of the scenes. The latter being the case most of the time but....

I watched the prequel up to a point (the part after Toraji is rescued in the woods and is explaining why he yelled out, &quot;Kaa-chaaan!!&quot;) anyway, there was a moment while watching that scene where my mind stopped trying to get it and just - got it. I found myself spontaneously laughing at what was being said as if I was watching a comedy in English. This was an exciting point in the Japanese process.

After that moment I stopped watching. I decided to stop watching Tiger and Dragon. The reason being is that I think the show is great so far and I want to watch the rest of the series after my Japanese is at native or near-native level. Does anyone think this is strange?

My original intention was to break down Tiger and Dragon sentence by sentence and put them in the SRS, but I fear doing this will kill the enjoyment that I could possibly get if I wait and watch it after I&#039;ve gained greater fluency. 

So my final question is, does anyone have any recommendations for shows or movies that might have similar type language that I can break down and put into the SRS?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jair Trejo,

Following up on what Alec said, one thing I did to help me was use TTS (I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://free-translator.imtranslator.net/speech.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt; -- it&#039;s not the best, but it&#039;s free) and had my wife randomly type numbers into the box. I&#039;d listen and write what I heard, then check it with my wife. Helped a *lot*.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jair Trejo; I used to have trouble with numbers until I started a part-time job in Japan as a store assistant. Telling customers how much their bill was and then counting out the change in Japanese was tough at first and I made silly mistakes (324en was &quot;three hundred two hundred and fourty&quot; etc) but after a while I got used to it and now am fine. Try getting someone who can speak even the most basic Japanese to read numbers out loud and you write it down. Or get a list of numbers from an online random number generator and practise reading them out aloud.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No success story here yet.Keyword is yet.  Just wanted to say congratulations to L- 2042 kanji in 6 days isn&#039;t just impressive - its unimaginable. I&#039;ve had days where I&#039;ve been unable to sleep from ramming through just 100 or so, and felt kanji &quot;burning&quot; in my head, all wanting to get out!!!
Good stuff man- keep on keeping on - pull harder on the strings of your kanji - or whatever else keeps you motivated!]]></description>
