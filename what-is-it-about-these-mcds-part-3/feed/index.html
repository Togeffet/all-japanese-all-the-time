					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to add.

MCDs are great for more than just kanji compounds.  I have trouble keeping straight in my head even various hiragana only words that sound similar, so I split them into separate parts based on their dips in pronunciation.  This actually helps me 1.  learn better pronunciation by practicing enunciating each part separately and 2.  memorize non kanji words that sound similar more clearly.
