					<description><![CDATA[YesAsia is great, I usually get my Asian music albums from them (the ones that I feel are really worth having the actual copy of). And on the topic of HK dramas, you can easily find Chinese subbed versions up for download on every major HK forum (Uwants, Discuss) spontaneously, though I don&#039;t know the legality of them in Japan. Too bad the JP dramas I watch online are either raw or subbed, no reading practice :(.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Btw, Amazon China is FANTASTIC. Chinese prices, cheap shipping, and it&#039;s never taken more than 2 weeks to get the US.  And the selection is awesome--and so are the reviews, which help me decide if a particular book or something is really worth getting.  The only downside is they won&#039;t ship software or let you use the MP3 download system...but honestly, Amazon US has some Chinese downloads, and iTunes is getting better--they keep adding Modern Sky compilations. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey everybody--

I&#039;m looking to buy some dvds dubbed in Japanese and with Japanese subtitles.  Can I just assume that every American movie on amazon.jp has these features?  I can&#039;t yet read most of what&#039;s on amazon.jp, even if I click the translate to English button.  So I&#039;m worried that I&#039;ll order a movie that has subtitles in Nihongo, but no audio.  Am I freakin&#039; out about nothing, or is there something I should look for indicating Japanese audio?

Thanks for the help y&#039;all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[seems like lots of cantonese and japanese dubs, but i don&#039;t see any mandarin dubs of anything i&#039;ve heard of.  Anyone have tips for finding mandarin dubs of disney or some popular tv series?  is there mandarin star trek or csi or something?

maybe the mistake is that i&#039;m browsing in english.  browsing in chinese led me to The Incredibles (mandarin version), so that&#039;s one video at least.  at $20 per movie this is gonna get expensive fast.  probably more worth my time to go check out the night-market in chinatown for cheap vcds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The items I&#039;ve bought in past have all been books with estimated shipping dates of 21 days, and it has been the sourcing that has taken a long time, not the actual shipping. That said, I just bought three books each with 21 day estimates and they shipped within a few days; it&#039;s been around a year since I last used yesasia so they might have gotten faster. If so, it might make it preferable to kinokuniya.

@scout
The problem is each individual store doesn&#039;t seem to have that great stock so even though I may want to buy $100 of books it isn&#039;t necessarily easy for me to buy them all from one single store. I assume the shipping costs are calculated after dividing the order between the individual stores? Or is that not the case?]]></description>

Also if you have a computer and don&#039;t want to spring for a region-free DVD player, you can use the free program DVD Shrink (google it to find a download link) to make a region free copy of your DVD that will play on any DVD player. That&#039;s what I do with my Japanese DVDs.]]></description>

it was actually a guy in a shop who pointed that out to me, most of the time you can get it to be &#039;region free&#039; just by entering a code (sometimes a long code with some weird instructions though (&quot;switch off DVD player, press button X, power on again, switch off, enter this code... and tadaa&quot;)) with the remote control.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Uberstuber
Not necessarily. Certain Macs, at least, are screwed because they have hardware region-code stuff that VLC cannot bypass. It depends what DVD drive you have. You can, however, switch your region coding - but typically only a limited number of times. Four or five, perhaps? But to start out with, the DVD drive is the same region as the first disc inserted.

@ captal
No, it&#039;s not legal. International copyright law - if it&#039;s copyrighted in one part of the world, it&#039;s copyrighted in most of the world. However, because it&#039;s not licensed, it&#039;s very unlikely that you&#039;ll get in serious trouble.
I do believe it&#039;s legal to download in Japan though, but not upload.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve ordered form YesAsia just 10 days ago. It&#039;s my first order but I do like the free shipping and paypal service.

The only &quot;problem&quot; is that they are quite slow, imho. If it was Amazon, my order would have arrived 6 days ago. Yesasia estimates July 2 as the ship out date, plus a couple of weeks to get it here. That makes around 35-40 days in total. And I&#039;m out of manga, NOW. I can f-feel the first signs a mental br-breakdown...

PS. It&#039;s not because of one or two out-of-stock items. All of the things I ordered (manga, books, movies) had an estimated shipping time of 21 days.]]></description>
