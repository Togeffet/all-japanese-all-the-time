					<description><![CDATA[I have a question: I&#039;ve got to the stage where I have over 7,000 flashcards in SRS. I have about 200-400 cards daily due for repition it usually takes me about 2 hours to get through, which is the majority of my daily study time. Now I feel I&#039;d rather spend the time reading books or comics. 

So my question is: do you reach a phase where you outgrow SRS? or should you keep with it and let the card volume naturally disperse over time?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m too lazy to read over 100 comments to make sure this isn&#039;t a repeat, but oh well, haha.

1) a short concise clear steps kinda guide would be nice. I can follow the table of contents but the continuity isn&#039;t really felt, I had to do a lot more reading just to get a better idea of what you were talking about. Though I love your humor and encouragement, it would be nice to see more bulletin type steps.

2)Explain how you&#039;re getting from complete noob (no kanji/kana) to using kanji and kana and English, to kanji/kana no English in srs/dictionary/media. I either can&#039;t find the articles explaining this better (specifically srs/dictionary), or it doesn&#039;t exist :D.

3)Adding in voice and sounds to srs, you say to do this, just not exactly how. I&#039;m resourceful and use Audacity so I&#039;m fine, but more noobish people might need help here.

4) I&#039;m poor. I don&#039;t allow this to be my excuse and find all sorts of free and fun jp stuff out there, but maybe other&#039;s in this boat (like younger kids and/or such) need help with how to find free things without it being scams. The way to immerse the environment without spending the G 

5) Looking for things when you don&#039;t know how. I often get more experienced JP speakers tell me to go search such and such up, but I don&#039;t know what the JP current world usage for it is. I cannot type in google.jp &quot;free online video games&quot; or &quot;home cooking recipes&quot; because I don&#039;t know how someone would say it, and short of annoying the Heck outta my friends continually for stuff like this, maybe there is something out there to help with this sort of thing. It seems this sorta beginner to middle ground step is a bit hard to cross. I know enough to know that I can find English equivalents, but not enough to use terminology/lingo that internet users use. I don&#039;t even know if you&#039;ve talked about this any either, but to me I love to be a web surfer (its my fun) but I don&#039;t know how to &quot;surf&quot; in Japanese. XD

6)I know it isn&#039;t your job, but maybe helping people with setting up your computer to allow asisan language packs (or mac&#039;s way), inputing, changing the os (some don&#039;t know how to even install a jp os much less read it), ect. Programs aren&#039;t always set up for easiness to some people, and it&#039;d be nice to get more information on some of this stuff you talk about with automation of desktop environment, ect.

That&#039;s about all I can really think about for now. Honestly to me the hardest step of all is getting through heising. I do a lot of media and talking to friends as much as possible in jp, but to me the heising method is rather boring. is there something else out there to get kanji down with the heising method that doesn&#039;t feel like teeth pulling at the same time? (and no the knuckles game isn&#039;t exactly fun to me either lol)

Regardless what you do Kaz I love your site!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, one thing I would like to know is how you transitioned from the print writing of kanji as used in Heisig, into the running writing style that most Japanese people use. This is a result of me having to constantly ask my Japanese friends to clarify their handwriting and having trouble to write it myself.

					<description><![CDATA[David,

If you could write some more about your reading method, that&#039;d be good. Your description is good, but still too ambiguous to be any real help, if you get what I mean.

Example, you just finished RTK and you know no readings and only English meaning, yeah? So how would you pick up anything when you&#039;re reading without a dictionary to give you the kanji&#039;s reading? And how would that kanji make any sense in a sentence, as the sentence is the foundation of this method?

So yeah, any further clarifications you can give would be a big help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To Dan and Alistair: I learned Esperanto and am learning Japanese, and I can tell you that although I don&#039;t mix them up with English I quite often mix them up with each other. Also, this happened far more when my Esperanto ability was equal to my Japanese ability, so maybe when you get really fluent in L2 you might mix it up with L1.

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062;Do you think L1 and L2 might get mixed?
&#062;Are you insane? L1 is your fluent mother tongue. I hope you’d know when you speaking in &#062;your own native language as oppose to when you weren’t. It’s impossible for you to mix &#062;these up.

Haha, I wish this were true. :D It happens quite a lot that when I try to chat in my native language (German), but just can&#039;t find the right words and default to L2 (English) in the middle of the sentence. Over 10 years of doing everything of interest in English leave their mark. ;) This has not yet happened to L3 (Japanese), but I&#039;m kinda expecting it soon. It already affects my pronunciation, as my accent slowly, but surely turns into a Japanese one. 

Anyway, I agree that it&#039;s very distracting to mix languages at the same time. I can&#039;t listen to an English podcast and do Japanese reps, for example, but アニメ on the side is fine.

@topic

The one thing that I wish someone told me (maybe only more often and louder) is the importance of constant fun. Understand why you are learning L2 in the first place and just do what you would do in it as if you were already fluent. I made the mistake of reading Japanese sites and watching shows out of a sense of duty, just because they were Japanese and not because I liked them. Nobody has to tell a WoW addict that he must reach level 70 asap and he better start grinding now, after all. ;)

If you have to force yourself to do something, it&#039;s most likely not worth the effort.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&gt;&gt;Do you think L1 and L2 might get mixed?<br />
&gt;Are you insane? L1 is your fluent mother tongue. I hope you’d know when you speaking in &gt;your own native language as oppose to when you weren’t. It’s impossible for you to mix &gt;these up.</p>
<p>Haha, I wish this were true. 😀 It happens quite a lot that when I try to chat in my native language (German), but just can&#8217;t find the right words and default to L2 (English) in the middle of the sentence. Over 10 years of doing everything of interest in English leave their mark. 😉 This has not yet happened to L3 (Japanese), but I&#8217;m kinda expecting it soon. It already affects my pronunciation, as my accent slowly, but surely turns into a Japanese one. </p>
<p>Anyway, I agree that it&#8217;s very distracting to mix languages at the same time. I can&#8217;t listen to an English podcast and do Japanese reps, for example, but アニメ on the side is fine.</p>
<p>@topic</p>
<p>The one thing that I wish someone told me (maybe only more often and louder) is the importance of constant fun. Understand why you are learning L2 in the first place and just do what you would do in it as if you were already fluent. I made the mistake of reading Japanese sites and watching shows out of a sense of duty, just because they were Japanese and not because I liked them. Nobody has to tell a WoW addict that he must reach level 70 asap and he better start grinding now, after all. 😉</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Not so much it would negatively influence your L1, but your L2 would be adversely affected by your L1. So you would be more prone to making L2 sentences that are L1 like. I think eventually you develop a kind of L2 mode where you just naturally express yourself and think in L2 without any thought. I am wondering if L2 and L1 will be kept bound if you are doing a lot of immersion whilst using/receiving L1. They start off quite bound as most people start by reading translations of L2 in L1 and go from there, to eventually not using L1 in the study of L2 at all.]]></description>
