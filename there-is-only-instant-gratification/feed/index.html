					<description><![CDATA[Ellen J. Langer, talks about the same thing. The myth of delayed gratification. Her main point was that instead of university students learning by rote memory so they can just get their masters and get out, she suggests they learn by actively thinking looking at what they are being taught from different perspectives. things like thinking of applications for concepts they learn. This is a form of &quot;novelty generation&quot; which is fun. I mean even from a medical, scientific perspective it is more pleasurable because novelty increases the dopamine. So I have been doing as much as I can to increase the novelty in my Hanzi studies taking your advice about making them as interesting as possible so it can&#039;t not be fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s important to put Khatz&#039;s posts into the context of a self-directed project. When someone&#039;s holding a gun to your head and telling you to work, what motivates your accomplishments isn&#039;t as much fun and rewards as it is potential punishment and high-cost failure. That&#039;s a thesis statement for an entirely different conversation about our school system.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Break up the assignments into smaller pieces? Tell yourself you only have to do this one (minute, problem, etc.) NOW and then you can go do some other fun thing that you really want to do.

But here&#039;s the thing, because the bites are so small -- the parts are so EASY, homework literally becomes addictive (= instant gratification) to do.

Kanji reps aren&#039;t inherently fun, but how many times have I accidentally finished mine using tiny chunks? More than I can count.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If this concept is really universally true then how does it apply to something like school?

&quot;Oh yeah.. I&#039;ll just do my smaller homework first with full knowledge that I still have to do my bigger homework later&quot;

I mean it&#039;s still all boring homework, and while you may get the pleasure of finishing smaller assignments quicker in the end it&#039;s all boring work that you dread. So how?]]></description>
