					<description><![CDATA[I like this idea, but doesn&#039;t it really come down to time?  Because 595 days would be great, but are we talking about 30 minutes a day or 4 hours a day?  It kind of sounds like 24 hours a day.  Man, you could get a doctorate in 595 days if you worked on it 24x7. ]]></description>

Oh well, at least it&#039;ll give me time to get through RTK (currently at about 500 in, using the Japanese Level Up deck), so by the time I do meet the &quot;Have $150~$250 a month available for purchasing Japanese stuff&quot; requirement, I&#039;ll qualify for BigBoi.]]></description>

I started BigBoi today. I feel good about it. I wasn&#039;t sure if I should go Vanilla or BigBoi, but I made the right choice. The few hundred RTK Kanji I forgot will come back quickly.

					<description><![CDATA[Aw man, I started RtK a little over a year ago and am only just now passing 1000 kanji. I am trying to squeeze it in amidst a really swamped grad student schedule though, preparing for my dissertation fieldwork, etc. I do a page a day now, but last year I did maybe a few whenever I remembered because I was so swamped. I had no idea people went through it so quickly though. I can barely remember my stories at my turtle&#039;s pace!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Huh. I&#039;m intrigued. Am currently studying for the JLPT level 2 and know about 1050 RTK kanji, so I&#039;m not sure what&#039;d be best for me, signup-wise. Sounds like fun, at least though. I enjoy trying pretty much everything to learn a language :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Raaahr, no !!! I don&#039;t want to be spoonfed !! I want the contents and the media, not to be taken by the hand and spoonfed ! I hate the idea of buying stuff, and I hate even more the idea of buying very expensive stuff ! I want to find things by myself or incidentally by a well-meaning person who gives his knowledge for free out of sheer enthousiasm ! I&#039;m not doing too bad at all by myself !!

This must be the first time in my life on the internet that I read &quot;stop reading right now&quot; and obey the incentive without a second thought. (though I couldn&#039;t help going at the bottom to read a few comments).

Good luck on your project. Being competent and earning good money for it from willing people is a concept that I totally support. Even though raaahr, this is so not for me that it&#039;s painful !!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fluency and pronounciation are separate topics. Your pronunciation can suck and yet you can be fluent; yes, even to a native level. If ithat weren&#039;t the case then only about .01% of all immigrants all over the world could claim fluency. There&#039;s no denying Khatzumoto has an accent on that video. But that&#039;s no basis to say the video doesn&#039;t prove he is fluent. And so what if he is rambling about random stuff? I can pretty much discuss anything from theology to physics, from philosophy to jazz, but when I&#039;m in front of a camera with friends, it&#039;s time to just fool around, even in my native language (Spanish).]]></description>
