					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t mean to put L1 in the second example, I was writing in haste and so a mistake occured :/

Oh, and the third good thing it does is making you capable to find a more accurate translation in 3 other languages than in one. You can translate one, say Korean item to Japanese, another to Spanish (e.g. couse it gives a better &#039;feeling&#039; of the word). Plus it urges you to focus (I guess), couse you don&#039;t know what will be another card&#039;s language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Except for the L1 Part. I do not think your L1 will expand after a certain age (Because you know most of it). Only way i think you can expand your L1 is to use L1-&#062;L1 dictionary and L1-&#062;L2 sentences. Though when you learn new words (atleast for me) a definition is fine and sentences are not necessary (L1-&#062;l1 Sentences)]]></description>

using ALL foreing languages to learn a new one. Two good thigs it does - reinforcing former languages and widening available resources. So not L1=&#062;L2=&#062;L3=&#062;Ln(Language now learning) but L1+L2+L3=&#062;Ln]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Learning to understand many languages (at the same time or not) is more realistic. If you don&#039;t speak every language you&#039;ve studied that doesn&#039;t mean you wasted your time. Just being able to understand people can really help you in many situations. And why polyglots don&#039;t get rich? It&#039;s quite simple: they don&#039;t have the time. Language learning is simply too much time consuming.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As someone who did learn two languages at once (French, Spanish) I have to say that time&#039;s the only answer. Here in Canada, French Immersion is a class option where all your courses except English Language Arts are in French from Kindergarten through Grade 9, at which point courses are offered in French, yet you only need to take French Language Arts and one additional in French.At the same time, I was learning Spanish (yes, a very similar language) through our school classes and at home.  

Note: French Immersion programs kinda suck, though, because the only French you hear except the teacher&#039;s is a fellow intermediate/novice in the lower grades and you&#039;re bound to have several misconceptions about a word&#039;s meaning and grammar when you come out of one of them. One thing that most of my classes didn&#039;t shake till grade 10ish was how you chose &quot;ma/mon&quot;; most of us would transfer our sex upon them!]]></description>
