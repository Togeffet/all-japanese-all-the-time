Track your time, seriously. Perhaps not every second, but definitely every chunk of ten minutes.

					<description><![CDATA[Quick question ^-^
Does anybody know how to type　the old versions of some kanji? Such as 學 instead of 学？ It&#039;s not even in the list of the IME after you hit space, and I don&#039;t want to have to draw it on the IME pad :)

					<description><![CDATA[I think counting things in hours at least is more sensible; seconds can give an impression of more than it actually is (&quot;I&#039;ve studied for a million seconds!&quot; &quot;But that&#039;s only like, 228 hours...&quot;) But years is definitely too big a thing to count your Japanese exposure in. It also give a sense of it being a lot, even if it really isn&#039;t. 
So that means, if I limit myself to say, 16 hours of Japanese input a day on average (I&#039;m sure it&#039;s more if I account for weekends and holidays, but I&#039;m too lazy to try and figure out what it might actually be; besides, the less I think the have the better because I&#039;ll work harder to get more hurrhurrhurr), and say I started this hard-core AJATT in April (again, I&#039;m sure it was before then, but that&#039;s the farthest bad I can remember doing this...) Today I have around 2800 hours of Japanese input. By the end of December I&#039;ll have 4320 hours of Japanese input, give or take...
Also, I&#039;ve finally figured out how to make sure I do everything in Japanese that I would in a normal day in English: have a check list. It makes things so much easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So true. I was studying Japanese for &quot;8 years&quot;. However, after tallying up my actual estimated time studying, it was only about 850 hours. Absolutely pathetic. I then realized that if I&#039;d been studying even somewhere around 1-2 hours for just 2 years, I&#039;d have over 5000 hours! Now imagine the hours if I&#039;d spent ALL (or even nearly all) of my free time learning just for 2 years....

Procrastination sucks, and I know from when I learned English that immersion works best (I was fluent in roughly a month). So why is it so hard for me to commit to immersing myself in Japanese? Must be that Adult literacy problem...(or sheer laziness). I&#039;m trying to immerse myself as much as I can but I feel I&#039;m not doing enough. :( Those seconds just aren&#039;t adding up fast enough!

Well time for me to do more kanji and sentence SRS drills, and go read the children&#039;s book I&#039;m lugging around. *mutters* immersion...immersion...immeerrrrrsion]]></description>
