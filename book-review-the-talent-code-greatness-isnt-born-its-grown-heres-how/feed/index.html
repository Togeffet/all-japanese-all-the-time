&quot;내가 거장의 경지에 이르기 위해 얼마나 열심히 노력했는지 안다면, 사람들은 별로 대단하게 여기지 않을 것이다.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, 
it&#039;s not going to be a comment regarding your last entry (although as always, I enjoyed what you wrote). But I want to live a link to a TED speech, which I think is in sync with this site. One of the phrases from the speech &quot;When there is curiosity, education happens&quot; :D Brilliant!

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Everyone worked for their language ability once. It only seems like it came effortlessly after the fact. Believe that.
Yep. After the new neurological links are created in our brain we can not understand very well those who are still working on the skill/ability. This is what makes great teachers/coaches so rare. They really need to understand people who are &quot;so different&quot; from you.]]></description>
