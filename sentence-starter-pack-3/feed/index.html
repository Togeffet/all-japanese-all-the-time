					<description><![CDATA[Hi Folks,

I&#039;ve put together an Excel workbook of about 500 sentences here for those of you just starting out. They&#039;ve been collected from random places. Although not perfect, it&#039;s certainly a place for people to start with their new sentence gathering.

Feel free to snag it from my webspace and email me with any comments/questions you have.

					<description><![CDATA[In addition to the explanation about the verb not being at the end, there definitely is a verb.  In this case however, they have opted to drop it as it being the norm for plain speech.  If you&#039;re a beginner you should memorize the fact that the simplest senteces are A ha B Desu.  Therefore, the verb at the end is simply desu.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is for Leaf

Leaf the 女に愛を告白する男 is a modified clause. In English the modifier follows the noun.  However in Japanese the modifier comes before the noun. i.e what kind of noun it is, is explained before the noun itself.

In the following example  I have placed the modifiers in brackets
English : The man (who confessed his love to the girl)
Japanese  : (who confessed his love to the girl) man 
therefore (女に愛を告白する) 男

  Hope this helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Daniel: Most of the time there&#039;s no difference between singular and plural. You can add &quot;tachi&quot; when you&#039;re talking about people but not things. If you said &quot;oyatachi&quot;, you might be talking about the parents at a school meeting but you wouldn&#039;t use it to refer to your own parents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all the great stuff you put up.

You said: &quot;Remember, there is no differentiation between singular and plural in Japanese.&quot; I&#039;ve been taught to put -tachi at the end, like in oyatachi (parents). Do Japanese not use this at all??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey there. I&#039;m still a beginner so find things hard to grasp... but I&#039;ve always been told verbs must come at the end of a sentence. Yet:

&quot;女に愛を告白する男&quot;

This has &quot;man&quot; at the end. What&#039;s up with that? 

Thanks,
Leaf.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is still good.  I like the idea of the japanese describing the sentences too...not sure I&#039;m ready to go there yet.  I recall the hanashi you did about &quot;babies really suck&quot; at walking.  I think maybe I&#039;m still a baby here.  I want to crawl, walk, run, fly, but I don&#039;t need to crash and burn for flying out of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz-san,

I&#039;d be very interested in seeing some of your &quot;all-japanese&quot; sentences, where the discussion is in Japanese as well.
