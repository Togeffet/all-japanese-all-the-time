					<description><![CDATA[whoa! i like the &lt;i&gt;Turn away, and look at the kid who plays Japanese video games all day. When it comes to real life, that lazy video game kid will run/read/write and speak circles around the one who just does what she’s told no matter how boring it is.&lt;/i&gt;

am a gamer also too,and in the first place, the reason what i wanted to know / understand japanese is because i wanna play those SUPER ROBOT WARS..

this article made me aware of the adult function not just the child function..
most of the time, i function as a child.. .. playing that video games..gundam SEED.. onechanbara..XD

thanks khatzumoto-senpai]]></description>
