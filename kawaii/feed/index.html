					<description><![CDATA[UnholyBurger,
„Äå„Å°„Çá„Äç and „ÄåË∂Ö„Äç are two totally different words. „Äå„Å°„Çá„Äç is indeed the shortened form of „Å°„Çá„Å£„Å®, but people only use it as an exclamation. You can&#039;t say „Äå„Å°„Çá„ÄÄ„Éá„Éñ„Äç instead of „Äå„Å°„Çá„Å£„Å®„Éá„Éñ„Äç.
On the other hand „ÄåË∂Ö„Äç means something like &quot;super-&quot; and it has to go before another word.]]></description>

This should clear it up:

http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn/223190/m0u/%E8%B6%85/

Japanese has too many words/phrases that sound identical to worry about pin-pointing a meaning to anything written in kana (like „Å°„Çá).  Instead, just kick-back and let the context make everything clear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am so confused right now. I see this all the time &quot;„Å°„Çáwwww&quot; which I assumed was short for „Å°„Çá„Å£„Å® (excluding the lol&#039;s of course).  but sometimes they will use the kanji &quot;Ë∂Ö&quot;. is this just misspelling on their part? because I know „Å°„Çá„Å£„Å® before something means like &quot;a little&quot; (got that from nacho libre when jack black said he was „Å°„Çá„Å£„Å®„Åß„Å∂(I think) and everyone was like &quot;„Å°„Çá„Å£„Å®?!www&quot;) What I am trying to get at is &quot;And this kitten is SUPER kawaii (Ë∂ÖÂèØÊÑõ„ÅÑ)&quot; threw me off. Not saying anyone is wrong, I would just like some clarification on this subject.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When did that theme song come out?
I think my friend showed it to me a long time ago, but I&#039;m not sure ‚óé‚ñ≥‚óé
I think I actually enjoyed it more then than now ÔºàÁ¨ëÔºâ
Anyway, this was interesting... and way, way, too cute xDD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[correction: After a bit of research, it seems that it was ÊµÅË°å„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã in 2007, and I heard/was linked this theme song lately by coincidence ^^;; 

Thanks for making me take this show seriously... I couldn&#039;t get past the theme song before, but once you do, the show makes great study (particularly shadowing) material. The dialogue is so natural yet easy to hear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure about the anime itself, but I think that at least the theme song has been ÊµÅË°å„Å£„Å¶„Çã in Japan for a little while. Even I (as an unhip 24-year old a non-anime fan who doesn&#039;t watch TV) have heard/been linked it sporadically in the last few weeks, and I was surprised yesterday to notice that it was selectable in that taiko arcade game!]]></description>
