					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a tip for anyone on a Mac. Turn OS X Japanese then when you browse in Safari if there are any words you don&#039;t understand press ctrl+cmd+d and then move your cursor over them, a dictionary will pop up giving you the Japanese (or English) definition.
Alternatively you could highlight the word first and then press ctrl+cmd+d but it doesn&#039;t always work as well.
May be a pointless tip but I use it all the time :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hey,

I agree about the monodic. About for years ago, I entered mexico from the us border with less than 20 words (palabras) in my vocab list. one of the first things a street seller suggested, and I thank him to this day, was to buy an elementary level spanish to spanish dictionary. So I found a high school spanish to spanish dictionary, and I gave away the bilingual dictionary to a younger street seller wanting to learn english. So I started looking up the words I already knew, and soon I was learning new words, jumping from page to page. 

anyways, in general, I really like your work. it is inspired, and inspiring. it is very systematic, yet not boring. I think as well learner you are, a good teacher as well you prove. keep it on.

and where am I know? well, I am far away from south america, but after 1 year and 8 months of travels, I was speaking spanish so fluently, that my english sounded hispanic, even my mother language (which is different from both). And I could sometimes trick natives into believing that I was from the next latin country - hence the slight different accent:) 

sorry this comment is getting long. a very intuitional rule of thumb was to avoid english at all costs, never stay at any &quot;together planet&quot; hostels, never go to touristic sites, and only make friends with mexicans who do not understand a word of english. 
cheers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something that I&#039;m coming to realize is that in dictionaries, just like any other medium or subject (like the news, for example), there is a certain set of words that get used over and over.  Unfortunately, I&#039;m finding it quite difficult to define these words in Japanese, as the definitions end up a bit circular.  I&#039;m very tempted to just limit myself to one or two tiers of recursion and then cut back to English definitions, in the hope that over time I will have to do this less and less (as I will start requiring less and less recursion).  Do you think this is going to handicap me somehow in the long run; i.e., should I just tough it through instead?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Katsumoto, I have a question!
I am from Brazil and I am learning English and japanese. I was using J-J dictionary and it is very good, the quality of the study improves a lot. I also noticed that using a monodic your reading speed improve. But, since I am not a english native speaker, sometimes use a J-E dictionary is good. I am doing Heisig and there is lots of words that I dont know. Many time I learn a new kanji and a new english word at the same time, and this is very good for me.

I just want to know what do you think, should I keep study using J-E dictionaries in order to improve both Japanese and English,  or just go to J-J.
Just to say, I never, never use portuguese... hahahaha..

See ya]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As it is, I&#039;m only nearing the end of my second month with Japanese, so there&#039;s still a lot of time (and room) left for growth. I&#039;m giving myself about six months of input before I do any output, and a year until I start reading sites like 2ch. (Which, BTW, are sites I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; would like to read.) I think goals like this are really important; they motivate by giving you that &#039;push&#039; to press on, even during slow or busy times, as those reflections of what you want would make you hesitate not even a moment in striving for it.

Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t quite &#039;felt&#039; the effect of an SRS program on my person yet (though I&#039;ve been using it since after the first month), although I do believe that it would contribute much to my abilities. I will however reflect back on what I&#039;ve gained through it after the year is over though.

Lastly, I appreciate the encouragement and belief, bro! I really do.

And thanks for the monolingual-dictionary tip! Will start looking around for an electronic dictionary soon. (I&#039;m thinking of a Canon or a Casio. Any recommendations?)

					<description><![CDATA[Ok, so let&#039;s say you&#039;re using a paper dictionary or electronic monolingual dictionary and you come across some characters that you can write but you don&#039;t know how to read.  How do you look that up?  What I don&#039;t get is I can look at it but I don&#039;t know how to get to the point where I can understand the words used in the definition.  (Say, for example, that I just completed heisig and can read a certain amount of words, I can probably read about 1500 words in kanji but I don&#039;t know how to look those up in the japanese dictionary even)]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re using a paper dictionary or electronic monolingual dictionary and you come across some characters that you can write but you don&#8217;t know how to read.  How do you look that up?  What I don&#8217;t get is I can look at it but I don&#8217;t know how to get to the point where I can understand the words used in the definition.

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;Did that just happen over time with all the studying you were doing or did you made a conscious effort to improve your reading speed?
After seeing a banner ad that flashed white kanji on a black background very quickly, I wanted a program that would display Japanese text to me at very high (&quot;near-subliminal&quot;) speed, but I didn&#039;t find one nor did I feel like writing one. In the end, my constant exposure to Japanese got me so used to it that my speed naturally increased. I can even skim text now (there was a time when I could totally read, but I totally could not skim).

&gt;I‚Äôve fallen waaaaaay behind on my reviews.
I feel you. Try doing your reviews first; finish them before doing additions. Remember that it matters just as much to maintain old knowledge as to acquire new knowledge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with you khatzumoto-san.  I re-started the monodic approach.  Like before, it‚Äôs taking me loads of time to get through just a few words (four in one hr, for example).  I felt a huge sense of accomplishment, though.  By the by, although it was four, I learned so many more in the process.  There is one drawback, however: I&#039;ve fallen waaaaaay behind on my reviews.  I&#039;ve had to make some serious adjustments.  

Question: You mentioned in an earlier post that you got to the point that you were able to read Japanese subtitles.  Did that just happen over time with all the studying you were doing or did you made a conscious effort to improve your reading speed?  If you did make this effort, do you have any tips that might help?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey again, Wan.

Often, we know when we are drowning, and when we are fighting-but-swimming. And when it comes to individual words (especially with kanji on our side), we can make great guesses.

Feel free to use your judgment. If it really is too much, you can wait a bit. BUT...but...I think most people underestimate themselves when it comes to monolingual dictionaries, and they see the extra time spent as wasted (which it absolutely is not, by the way). Most people could do it if they just tried. So, I encourage you and everyone else to use monodics. I KNOW you can do it.]]></description>
