					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d strongly recommend learning skip codes, http://www.basic-japanese.com/Hilfsdateien/skipCode.html , they&#039;re a method of describing &quot;classes&quot; of kanji through patterns and are great for finding kanji in pictures/books by narrowing options down from a few thousand options to around ten.
Also not sure what your operating system is, but while getting your OS into japanese can be a hassle enabling japanese just requires downloading some software called an IME.
