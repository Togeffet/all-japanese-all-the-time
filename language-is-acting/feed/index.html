					<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t &quot;read&quot; it, per se, at least not in the beginning.  In the beginning, you will mostly be looking at Japanese.  No you won&#039;t understand it.  But just as listening without understanding is essential, so too is looking without understanding.  Try to look at some real unadulterated Japanese text every day, and ideally several times per day.  Doesn&#039;t have to be for very long.  Maybe just pick out some kanji you recognize or something, and then move on.  It&#039;s up to you.  But you have to get used to the idea that that crazy Jyapaneeze writing is actual text.  That seems obvious, but a lot of times when our eyes come across foreign text,  they just glaze right over it and keep on going.  You need to train yourself not to avert your gaze.  Sounds a bit weird, but seriously.  Just go stare at some damn text.  Pretend its a staring contest between yourself and Japanese.  Are you gonna lose? Hell no you&#039;re not.  :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback! :)

Yeah, you&#039;re right about not feeling bad; I think I&#039;m paranoid that I&#039;m not paying close enough attention to my Japanese audio. Sure, it&#039;s on all the time, so I *hear* it all the time, but I don&#039;t know if I *listen* to it enough.

Anyway, my pretending to be Japanese question stems from a technique for success where you believe you already are what you&#039;re trying to be. I&#039;m not really trying to become a Japanese citizen, I just want to learn the language and be in-tune with Japan, so perhaps that technique isn&#039;t really that valid here.]]></description>

How do you remind yourself that you are now a Japanese person, and how do you make yourself truly believe that this is true?

					<description><![CDATA[The native language is body language and vocal tone. =D There are variations due to culture, sure, but I have yet to hear of any place on earth where a smile is a negative thing (unless you count creepy villain smiles...). And apparently the spiffy researchers of psychology and all that jazz have found that even newborn infants can both use and recognize (once their eyes &#038; brain track well enough to realize that that thing they see is a face) facial expressions instinctively.

No matter where you go, if you see a girl leaning away from the guy next to her who&#039;s trying to hit on her it tends to mean she&#039;s just not that into him (or maybe his breath just stinks?), and I can recognize semi-coherent rage no matter what language it comes in. A fist is a fist is a fist, and even the tells of lying are the same regardless of language. We are all humans after all, last time I checked, and we hold a lot more similarities than differences.

The nice thing is that body language can help us fill in context gaps when we&#039;re stumbling about trying to learn Japenese (or anything else for that matter). We just have to make sure we&#039;re consciously paying attention*.

During my middle school years my dad worked for a summer in Germany and I got to tag along. I particularly remember this one experience with a german girl around my age who was the daughter of one of my dad&#039;s work colleagues. While they sat around talking and being old farts she and I played together and had no problem despite the fact that our knowledge of the other&#039;s language barely extended past colors and numbers. We pointed at objects and exchanged terms some, but mostly we just got on by gesturing, showing, and giggling. And we came up with some imaginative, fairy-chasing dance games, not just playing on swings or something.

Granted German and English are much closer than Japanese and English, but the language barrier is never as big in person as it is in say, text. Why else would we use emoticons so much even when chatting on the internetz in the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; language, ne?

*If you&#039;re ever picked up by a flying saucer though, I make no guarantees about how useful body language will be for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello khatzumoto!

    Before i begin, i want to tell you that you are one facinating human 
being. I feel as though we perhaps share the same brain except i feel 
that you are more of what i really wish to be like.

My name is Angelique and i am learner of Mandarin Chinese for about a 
year.

I stumbled across your blog, searched through the table of contents,
and picked &quot;Language is Acting&quot; to read first.

I was completely blown away because all that you said is exactly how i 
feel and what i&#039;ve been trying to explain people.

You see, I am spanish by blood but i do not speak it and i always get 
made fun of because i do not speak Spanish, totally have no desire to 
speak Spanish, and is learning Chinese. Let me give you an example of 
what i go through.

Random Person: *is speaking Spanish assumming i know how*
Me: * is staring with a blank face like an idiot*
Random Person: &quot;You no speak spanish?&quot;
Me:...&quot;no &#062;&#062;,&quot;
Random Person: *looks like he just had a heartattack*....&quot;WHAT?!!!!&quot;
Me: &quot;You see, Although my mother is hispanic she never was taught the 
language and although my father, who is puerto rican, speaks Spanish he 
never taught me....so yeah...&quot;
Random person: *shakes head out of pity*
Me: *slowly walks away annoyed&quot;....-_-+


  I try to reason with people like the that. I tell them that no one is 
&quot;born&quot; Spanish, no one is &quot;born &quot; Chinese, and no one is &quot;born&quot;, 
Japanese. I tell them that culture and language are things that we are 
not born with but are taught. A bird is born knowing how to build a 
nest but a human being is not born knowing a culture or a specific 
language. A human may &quot;look&quot; like he&#039;s Chinese, Spanish, or Japanese, 
but all that is is just looks.

But even so, people still just dont get it. They call you a freak or 
not normal just because you LOOK like a Chinese, Spanish, or a Japanese 
but do not speak or do the things Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese people 
do because you werent taught that way.

Besides that issue, I always saw learning language as acting. A 
successful actress isnt one who merely reads lines from a script but 
becomes it.

A successful learner of a language can&#039;t just merely speak the language 
but must become it.

My other Chinese learning friends would be like &quot;Angelique you sound so 
good!! Do you study a lot...?&quot; And i would say &quot;Yes i study everyday&quot;. 
But honestly anyone can just study a language and never sound great no 
matter how much studying they do because they are not becoming the 
language. When i speak Chinese i become it even though i takes much 
courage and boldness on my part since i am naturally a shy timid 
individual but i somehow do it.

Even so, I still stuggle though. My enemy is intimidation and is 
something that i fight hard to overcome. I get so intimidated when im 
around native speakers that i realize that i know nothing and i am 
still a &quot;baby&quot;.

One thing that i wanted to ask you is how were you able to master the 
Japanese grammer so fast? You see, i am struggling with Chinese grammer 
and it is making me want to rip my brain out of my skull and stomp on 
it....seriously.

Do you have any tips, advice on mastering grammer and how not to attack your own brain?

Anyways, thank you for your encouragment. Now when people make fun of 
me i&#039;ll say &quot; I have the right to learn the Chinese language!!! and 
chase them off with my chopsticks. xD]]></description>

language. A human may &#8220;look&#8221; like he&#8217;s Chinese, Spanish, or Japanese,<br />
but all that is is just looks.</p>
<p>But even so, people still just dont get it. They call you a freak or<br />
not normal just because you LOOK like a Chinese, Spanish, or a Japanese<br />
but do not speak or do the things Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese people<br />
do because you werent taught that way.</p>
<p>Besides that issue, I always saw learning language as acting. A<br />
successful actress isnt one who merely reads lines from a script but<br />
becomes it.</p>
<p>A successful learner of a language can&#8217;t just merely speak the language<br />
but must become it.</p>
<p>My other Chinese learning friends would be like &#8220;Angelique you sound so<br />
good!! Do you study a lot&#8230;?&#8221; And i would say &#8220;Yes i study everyday&#8221;.<br />
But honestly anyone can just study a language and never sound great no<br />
matter how much studying they do because they are not becoming the<br />
language. When i speak Chinese i become it even though i takes much<br />
courage and boldness on my part since i am naturally a shy timid<br />
individual but i somehow do it.</p>
<p>Even so, I still stuggle though. My enemy is intimidation and is<br />
something that i fight hard to overcome. I get so intimidated when im<br />
around native speakers that i realize that i know nothing and i am<br />
still a &#8220;baby&#8221;.</p>
<p>One thing that i wanted to ask you is how were you able to master the<br />
Japanese grammer so fast? You see, i am struggling with Chinese grammer<br />
and it is making me want to rip my brain out of my skull and stomp on<br />
it&#8230;.seriously.</p>
<p>Do you have any tips, advice on mastering grammer and how not to attack your own brain?</p>
<p>Anyways, thank you for your encouragment. Now when people make fun of<br />
me i&#8217;ll say &#8221; I have the right to learn the Chinese language!!! and<br />
chase them off with my chopsticks. xD</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatzumoto,

I&#039;m not learning Japanese (yet), but I&#039;m planning on doing it in the future... However, I&#039;m learning German and, although your method is mainly designed for the Japanese learner, it&#039;s in accordance with my own ideas on language learning and I&#039;d like to improve my learning. Now to the point: I try to listen to German on the bus and I search for content on the web and to talk to native speakers on skype. I&#039;m currently using the lingq method, which I think you already know (www.lingq.com) and I try to be immersed in the language. But can&#039;t live in the language, as much as I try. How did you really do it before going to Japan? You had to talk to people in English, and how did you manage to only watch TV in Japanese? 

Sorry for the big post...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[.PLATEAUS AND DEAD-ENDS

Dear Teacher:

I wanted to send you this as an attachment because I tend to hit plateaus where I level out and take more time to master characters.  When I am faced with a dead-end and feel no progress, I have found two methods of clearing up the problems.

An example:  

For over a year I have confused these two characters:  “packed” and “cottage,” assuming that both used crock pot and forgetting the stories.

Two solutions to quicken and sharpen the mental image of Heisig’s stories:

(1)	Use questions that reflect a logical grammatical connection between or among parts of the kanji so that the answers to the questions are the actual sub-kanji or key words.

(2)	Use the word perfect to enlarge the kanji so details and connections are seen more clearly to discriminate between two characters that may look similar when the font size is very small.



“PACKED” 詰
(I tried but can&#039;t copy and paste the 48 font)
“COTTAGE” 舎
(I tried but can&#039;t copy and paste the 48 font)

I recently discovered I needed better glasses and so they help; however, these kanji have been copied and pasted into a Microsoft word document so that they can be enlarged and effectively contrasted, thus more clearly understood.  Solution 2 addresses a physical problem of actually seeing the text. 

Solution 1 addresses logical understanding of the story composed by Heisig or by the student (if Heisig’s story doesn’t work).

“Packed,” for me, requires two questions:  “What is packed?”  and “What is its container?”  When I answer them and connect them logically by the questions in my native language (I have no experience as a native speaker and reader of the kanji), then I can more readily store the image and accept it.  I use my native language as a bridge.

“Cottage,” for me, requires  two questions:  “What keeps the rain off me?”  and “Where could food be stored?”

I know that the ideal level to reach is forming the questions and stories in Japanese, finally letting go of the native language.  However, these basic tools are encouraging me to add new kanji and increasing my confidence in retaining what I have studied.  

I really enjoyed the experience you shared from your university comedy group.  Often mental cruelty is just thoughtless remarks, commenting on something the speaker can&#039;t control.
