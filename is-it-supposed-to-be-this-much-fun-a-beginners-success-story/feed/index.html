					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I never read one definition for any particle I just got used to how they were used and now I don‚Äôt need an explanation.&quot;
I&#039;ve learned english like that. But I was afraid that with nihongo it won&#039;t work.
tnx for nice post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I started the kanji study not too long ago as well, using both Heisig and kanjidamage.  Since they teach by radical rather than frequency I know some fairly obscure kanji already.  I was flipping through my old copy of Kanji and Kana looking for something the other day and saw an kanji numbered in the thousands that I recognized.  It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling inside!  I&#039;ve also started recognizing and figuring out kanji from anime.  It&#039;s very inspiring, so I can definitely relate :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I suggest just churning out around 1000+ pre-mined sentence reps, you should be able to download pre-mined stuff on Anki. It&#039;ll be more grudging to do them but just do a couple every time you have to wait for som„Åàthing and they will add up to alot. After that you should have a good enough understanding of Japanese to find your favorite sentences. In the begÔΩáining you could use Denshi Jisho/Rikaichan for immediate lookup for most words, although there are some things you can&#039;t find. Also by getting used to reading Japanese everything will all start to make sense. I never read one definition for any particle I just got used to how they were used and now I don&#039;t need an explanation.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m almost complete with RTK1, I only have 80 Kanji left to go, and I&#039;ve been doing 20 a day recently, so only 4 more days until I finish the book. :D

I&#039;m starting sentences soon (obviously), I&#039;ve read all of the 10k sentences posts in the blogs, but i&#039;m still a little lost :(

I understand what khatz talks about, using real japanese sentences found from wherever. Though he said his first 500-1000 were J-E sentences. Where am I supposed to find the meanings of the sentences I mine? I&#039;ve been mining random sentences from japanese games, manga, and songs for the past month, so I already would have plenty, ready to go.

I would just like to know where am I supposed get readings for the Kanji, the meaning of the sentences and where to find out what each thing is in the sentence.

thanks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know, right?

When you&#039;re studying right, it doesn&#039;t even feel like studying.  When you&#039;re REALLY studying right, it just feels like watching anime, listening to podcasts, playing videogames, reading manga, or whatever you&#039;re doing, and it just HAPPENS to be in Japanese.  In other words, you don&#039;t feel any pressure or (ultimately) even the fact that it&#039;s in a foreign language, you just enjoy it.

This is IMO such a great way to study because you do not run out of motivation.  Make you escape activities happen in Japanese, and when you escape from work or other stress, you&#039;re effectively studying, but you *really are* blowing off steam and relaxing in the meantime.  Win-win to the max.  There is no urge to stop...  You WANT to continue!]]></description>
