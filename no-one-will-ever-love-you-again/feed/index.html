					<description><![CDATA[Time to pretend to be egotistical, Mwahahahaha!

First, I want to say that I really like you and the other anti-weeaboos, no seriously, I really do.  You guys are SO successful in your hobby(along with other groups of people of course), that nobody(they give up or lose desire of such) ever gets fluency in Japanese, ever.

There is a single problem with your tactic, of course.  Ya forgot to account for me, ME!  See, by making sure everyone only speaks English, I will eventually get the ability to speak the language and pretty much be the only one who can in the radius of at least 100-200 miles+, so thanks very much for that.

Now, you must obviously must be thinking, I&#039;m just like everyone here you really dislike with a deep passion.  Well, not really.  My reason for Japanese is because I love it, I want to read Japanese Textbooks my way and most importantly, I&#039;m totally in love with their food and want to read Japanese food labels!

The only things anime I have interest is Touhou vocal music, which I use with a Bookmark randomizer I found on Chrome&#039;s Webstore.

So thanks alot for unexpectedly giving people like me a leg up in this world.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love shadowing, and it&#039;s super useful, but I&#039;m not sure I want to do it on the train or walking down the street either.  I mean, there&#039;s a lot of stuff that&#039;s fun to do that might be better done at home.  Still, I guess you could always just pretend like you&#039;re having a phone conversation with someone, and then maybe it wouldn&#039;t look so weird.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, if you could read what I wrote you would know that it wasn&#039;t even racist, and considering that Koreans and Japanese are the same race, what you made sort of makes no sense. That&#039;s like a guy in Europe making fun about how &quot;obese&quot; Americans are and saying they all own firearms and have McDonalds pumping through their veins, and then being called a racist. 

Making a joke about a country equals Racism these days? Oh jeez.

I also want you to know that I don&#039;t blindly carry &quot;prejudices&quot; of the Japanese. I&#039;ve researched the political and social histories between the countries, so I sort of know what I am talking about.

3 or 4 people have said? Well, when there is anti-Japanese elements in the Korean public education system, most older people in Korea hate Japan, When big Korean people like that Soccer player act pro-japanese they get hated in their country, when the country treats an Assassin who killed the Japanese prime minister in 1909 like a Hero, when at the Soccer games they have to resort to showing huge political banners, like this Year in July and the London Olympics with that Soccer player who ran around with a sign, I do have to say it&#039;s more than 3-4 people.

I don&#039;t blindly &quot;hate&quot; koreans or Chinese. I don&#039;t even hate to begin with, I just find that a lot of the stuff Korea does is just stupid. Like the time when a company was forced to Apologize to Korea because they made an iphone case with the Japanese Navy Flag, because the koreans said it was like the Nazi flag, because tons of people were killed under it. 

Give me a break. 

Once again, I don&#039;t hate anybody. And if you could read what I wrote you would realize it wasn&#039;t even that bad, just a &quot;rude&quot; joke to respond. I just don&#039;t like the political and social antics that Korea causes.

Talk about over-reaction.

Though somebody like you most likely hasn&#039;t done much research of the past.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Are you explicitly trying to hide your racism by posting in Japanese? What a coward.

I&#039;m not trying to make this a political debate, but there are more Koreans that would rather watch the Japanese suffer from genocide than to actually be Japanese, and vice versa. Because of the Korean wave, there are some Japanese that may say they wish they were Japanese, but there are more Japanese that want Koreans wiped out. 

I know this site has a lot of weeaboos and hate Koreans and Chinese and believe that they&#039;re inferior to Japanese, but don&#039;t go generalizing 70 million people over what 3-4 people have said. With the animosity between the two countries, there are very few people in each country that wish they were the other.

For all of the time I&#039;ve been reading this blog, Khatz has never advocated people here to blindly hate Koreans/Chinese just because the majority of Japanese people do. From my understanding, he wants people to think of themselves as being Japanese when learning Japanese so that no one can make excuses about &quot;Oh, I&#039;m American, this is too hard&quot; or &quot;Oh, I&#039;ll just use English because Japanese is too hard.&quot; He has never advocated for people to carry the same prejudices the Japanese have against other nations.

If you&#039;re too big of a pussy to respond in English, then don&#039;t bother.]]></description>

Oh, you&#039;re talking about shadowing... alright, we&#039;ll put that aside for now then.

... but for realz. How and why did humans get to the point that learning is &#039;weird&#039; and something to be embarrassed about? Why do I get odd looks for watching asian media, as though exposure to different cultures is something to be ashamed of? I&#039;ve gotten funny looks just for reading the Art of War. 
Somebody saw me reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms and asked what it was about, when I replied that it was a Chinese historical novel the reply was a long pause followed by, &quot;...what&#039;s the point in that?&quot; to which I replied &quot;What&#039;s the point in anything?&quot;

Why is reading an old historical novel seen as weird and pointless yet Fifty Shades of Gay is hot stuff?]]></description>
