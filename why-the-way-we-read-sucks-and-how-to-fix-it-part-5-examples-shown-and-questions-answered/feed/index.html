					<description><![CDATA[You know, I use Evernote for the non-language study stuff (recipes, inspiration etc.)- although lately I&#039;ve been putting recipes on Pinterest because it&#039;s fun to share them with people too. 
I am aggressively organized because I deal with so much research data-
Voodoo Pad = organizing book notes before dumping them into DevonThink, works like a WIKI. 
Papers = organizing my academic PDFs. 
Zotero= organizing my list of sources - rethinking this, may try Bookends
DevonThink = for my dissertation materials- audio, photo, video, book notes, scanned field notes
Scrivener= only for lengthy projects, dump organized materials from DevonThink in there only when actively writing. Otherwise OpenOffice for writing.
Evernote- non research &quot;data&quot; or misc random academic thoughts.
Everything I create or discover anywhere gets filed with these :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been currently playing around/adjusting my anki decks to my liking. So far so good. I find that having a few huge decks is way better than having many small ones,easier to organize, easier to do, and less time to do it in. I&#039;ve found what works best for me is doing a good portion of srsing each day(1 hour each day) and rest is passive/reading/writing,etc in japanese. It&#039;s worked really well but nowadays I&#039;ve been finding more ways of making stuff more effective and less time consuming. I&#039;m heading towards the 9 month mark here(8.9 months as stated in my main sentence deck, should be full 9 months within a few days or so). I remember when I started japanese, I wanted to be able to read it understand it,watch dramas,movies,animes,read mangs,play video games in japanese, be able to read transcripts,etc. Now that I can do that, I don&#039;t feel I should stop there even. It&#039;s a never ending journey but it&#039;s not about the results it&#039;s about the process. Making it seamlessly painless is the way to go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am recently separating all-kanji decks from strictly nihongo decks.

The improvement is tremendous!

I guess it has something to do with not having the pressure to be able to write the kanji in the sentence or even read it. If I understand it, it&#039;s good enough. And while in the kanji deck, I can go about slowly, burning them as well as I can in my memory, without the pressure to keep going to get to the real &quot;immersion&quot; (yeah, I am inputting sentences without having finished Heisig).

I mean, now everything&#039;s easier. I just got off of a long long period with barely no immersion (constant exposition, yeah, but far, far away from immersion) and this was just the thing to get me back on track.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, Khatz.
Very inspiring and highly useful info here. Thank you.
I am a student of Mandarin.  I have decent fluency, grammar, comprehension but I need to learn more hánzi big time.
I have perused many of the posts here but could not find the answer to the following:
What is a specific program I can use for SRS to learn Mandarin characters/sentences?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Do you use one massive deck for all of your SRSing, or switch off between decks?&quot;

I could not help but admire the brevity, clarity, and structure of this question. I mean, it would be gold in any English learner&#039;s SRS deck.  Then I realized it was my own question.  Verbatim, pasted from the part 4 post.  (Except for the omitted hyphen between SRS and ing)  My language learning idol/role model/hero/cult leader anonymously quoted me.  Sweet.  我好感動!

I think what&#039;s happened to French, will eventually happen to more and more languages as people discover the power of immersion and SRS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very insightful. Especially the part about grading -- it&#039;s obvious now that you&#039;ve said it aloud but I would&#039;ve regarded it as a huge problem.

I actually once got an idea of making a system in which I would store everything I learn. Sort-of-like SuperMemo&#039;s Incremental Reading, except something that doesn&#039;t make you want to jump out of the window. One that&#039;d allow me to, for example, read scanned manga and easily mine sentences so that it&#039;d preserve the page jpg for context etc. But I never got around trying to figure out how to code something like that.

Now I again realize that all this can be reasonably achieved by Surusu or Anki (listed in reverse alphabetical order to please Khatz :D ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;飛 看大雪紛飛 卻再也找不回&quot; 

I spy with my little eye 王力宏 lyrics.  Personally, I look up words I don&#039;t know in lyrics when the mood strikes, but I don&#039;t feel the need to SRS them as they come up every time I hear the song.

Also, why do you use Mandarin pinyin pronunciation keys for a Cantonese source?]]></description>
