					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto,

I&#039;ve started using KhatzuMemo, mainly for its keitai usability which helps me out a lot with lots of train riding.

two questions about the program:

1)  I noticed my timezone is set to US Pacific (says on the stats page after each rep), but I live in Japan, so the &quot;day&quot; resets in the middle of the day.  I don&#039;t see a settings page in KhatzuMemo, is there any way to change the timezone?

2)  I&#039;m curious about the relative &quot;meanings&quot; of the scores 0-5.  0 is pretty easy, but sometimes I find myself racking my brain about whether to give myself a score of 3, 4, or 5 for the stuff I remember.  At Mnemosyne, they have these guidelines for grading yourself (also 0-5):
http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/help/getting-started.php

Would you say these Mnemosyne guidelines for grading apply to KhatzuMemo grading as well?

Thanks a bunch. 10,000 Sentences is the best idea I&#039;ve read in a long time...wish I&#039;d found this site last year or just come up with the idea on my own, it seems so blindingly obvious now.  Would&#039;ve made this past year even more useful.

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I&#039;ve never studied Japanese formally, but lived there for three years and picked up what I could by way of osmosis! I bought RTK1 and 2 and made all the flash cards, yes, every single one of them! Then learned up to about 700, burned out, then started again and then learned up to 700 again (must be my magic number), then burned out again!
I&#039;ve been reading everything on your site and wish that it was around when I began. But, as you say, stop beating myself up with that sort of thing!\Thanks for an amazing site!\

My question too:

Do I have to type in every single one of Heisigs kanji and story into Khatzumemo? I&#039;ve already made the cards, but can see the real benefits of Khatzumemo being on my phone. I&#039;m even tempted to buy an iPhone, but we&#039;ll see how that goes?

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Khatz and others,

I&#039;ve successfully loaded 600 kanji from .xml into khatzumemo using the following format (hopefully the posting system on this page won&#039;t garble this):

&lt;A&gt;‰∏Ä&lt;/A&gt;&lt;Q&gt;one&lt;/Q&gt;
&lt;A&gt;‰∫å&lt;/A&gt;&lt;Q&gt;two&lt;/Q&gt;
...


And it worked OK! All Q/A loaded, everything (all 600) displayed on &quot;View All Items&quot;. The only problem I have is that khatzumemo only wanted me to do 50 or 60 of those kanji today! What about the other 650??? I keep clicking on &quot;Review (do reps)&quot;  and keep getting the &quot;Repetitions Complete&quot; message with the ÂÆå‰∫Üpicture. :( Yet if I add 5 new items manually all 5 will appear in the Rep, but none of the stuff added from my xml file!!

Am I doing something wrong here or is this the way it&#039;s supposed to work? Hmm I&#039;ve read the previous posts here and... just wondering, does this have anything to do with the 100 (one Wan) review limit? Hmmmm ...I don&#039;t get it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hello

recently ive been tryin to upload my file into your online program, but after I do the upload it, it says I have nothing to do for reps.

i&#039;m not sure if i&#039;m just not using the correct file or what.

What is the basic file name in the mynosyne directory?  : C:\Documents and Settings\username\.mnemosyne. is the filepath correct? 

Thanks

					<description><![CDATA[HI Khatzumoto,

Someone at the Reviewing the Kanji site recommended your site so I&#039;m giving it a go.
I&#039;m kinda new at this SRS stuff.
I can&#039;t seem to find an explanation of how you are meant to use it.
Like a step by step summary.
How often should I run it.
How many sentences to add at a time.
And, most importantly, what do the numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 mean?
Explaining those things would be a great help to what appears to be a very useful site.
Thanks.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey khatzumoto,

I don&#039;t know how to do the conversion from an Anki file to a Memosine file. How would i go about doing that? Can Memosine do the import of an Anki file or do i have to use Anki to do it? I don&#039;t see any alternate &quot;Save As...&quot; options in Anki that would allow me to convert them to Memosine files. It&#039;s a little tricky to see exactly how to do this. I&#039;m computer literate but I&#039;m  a little stuck with this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(Feeling rather foolish) Sorry but I don&#039;t quite get how to use the SRS.  Should I be writing &quot;‰∏Ä&quot; in the question section and &quot;one line on it&#039;s back&quot; in the answer section?

What are other examples of how to make use of it?

Thanks for getting me on the right track!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I like your idea for having the web based SRS, I&#039;d like to be using it on my phone too. I see that it it possible to import XML files from Mnemosyne, I&#039;ve been using Anki more oftern. Is it possible to import those files from Anki? Or is there any way i can turn Anki files into XML files that will be usable in KhatzuMemo ?]]></description>
