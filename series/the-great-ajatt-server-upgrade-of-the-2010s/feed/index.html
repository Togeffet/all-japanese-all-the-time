<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/ajatt-server-upgrade-scheduled-downtime">So yeah, server upgrade, <strong>downtime</strong>, read the previous post to get up to speed.</a></p>
<p>The big question is when? The answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start time: March 30, 2013 @ 0630~1230 Japan Standard Time
<ul>
<li>Beginning in this time window, you will start to experience an inability to access some or all of the constellation of server-dependent AJATT sites, subsites and services. Everything from this main blog to Surusu, AJATT Plus and everything else in between are no exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>End time (projected): April 6, 2013 @ 1200 Japan Standard Time
<ul>
<li>By this time, everything should be back to normal, with you and I happily sipping smoothies and enjoying hookers and blow at the new AJATT server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, prepare for a few days of downtime followed by several years of bliss <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>Special Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special arrangements are being made so that Neutrino core downtime can be on the order of hours rather than days.</li>
<li>Surusu will most likely take the biggest hit in terms of length of downtime due to the sheer volume of users (15,000) and data (many a gigabyte) involved. And also because it&#8217;s free <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . But most importantly, to <strong>secure the integrity of the data</strong> and ensure a seamless transition. Ultimately, Surusu will benefit a great deal from all the &#8220;500 Internal Server Error&#8221;s (due to server overload) it won&#8217;t be having on the new, more powerful server.</li>
<li>The whole situation is rather fluid so all this information is subject to change as conditions on the ground shift and/or reveal themselves. I&#8217;ll keep you posted <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</li>
</ul>

<p>How are those mothers of yours?<br />
Great, great. Good times.</p>
<p>So guess what? AJATT has grown too big for her britches! Or&#8230;breeches? I don&#8217;t even really know what britches are, but there&#8217;s definitely a size and scale issue going on. Yeah&#8230;a few years online, lots of notoriety, Neutrino and the best SRS in the world will do that for you. So the plan is to upgrade to a ridiculously awesome server so that&#8230;things can continue being even more awesome. Don&#8217;t worry, I don&#8217;t need to know adjectives any more because I can just say &#8220;awesome&#8221; whenever I want to say something is superb.</p>
<p>Like: &#8220;your Mom is superb sauce&#8221;.<br />
â†‘Free usage example!</p>
<p>No, but, yeah, so the original plan was to have it so that the server would experience no downtime whatsoever and you wouldn&#8217;t even know what was happening back here. But after several weeks of keyboard-mashing back and forth with the migration team at the new superb sauce server, it was decided that it&#8217;s best to just shut things down for a few days, move everything and then&#8230;you know, whatever. That way there&#8217;ll be no issues with some people accessing old data and other people accessing new(er) data. No synchronization issues and what have you.</p>
<p>TL;DR: AJATT may go down for a while. Don&#8217;t freak out; it&#8217;s not an accident; it&#8217;s a carefully planned and executed upgrade by seasoned professionals ( <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ). She will rise again. Check back in a week or less. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Also, you look wonderful today. Muah.</p>
