								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 1 of 2 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/patience/" class="series-154" title="Patience">Patience</a></div><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/when-to-start-getting-used-to-japanese">&#8220;A lord spoke to his servant one day:<br />
Lord: Be sure to plant that cherry tree this afternoon.<br />
Servant: But it will not bloom for 40 years!<br />
Lord: Better make it this morning then.&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&#8221;<br />
Chinese Proverb (or so the Internets claim)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://discoveredintheprocess.tumblr.com/post/14965887945/best-of-2011-plant-an-orchard">&#8220;If you want fruit today&#8230;too bad, you should have planted an orchard 5 years ago. But if you want to eat fruit in 5 years&#8217; time, then you had better start planting an orchard today.&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So here&#8217;s where it gets weird. You want to <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/calm-down-and-hurry-up"><strong>be patient and impatient at the same time</strong></a>. You want to hold one attitude, to be in one emotional state, and its polar opposite, toward the same subject at the exact same time.</p>
<p>Be patient enough to wait for results but not so patient that you do nothing to produce them.</p>
<p>Be patient enough to wait for effects. Be too impatient to wait to start on <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/max-out-the-cause-card">causes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/let-go-but-dont-let-go-the-learning-paradox">As with the vocab paradox, be nonchalant, careless even</a>, about reaping: let the harvest come when it comes. But be a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/bucolic-wisdom-or-stop-slagging-seeds-silly-city-slickers">stickler for sowing</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi1MemQ8MqY">Always be sowing.</a>Â Like a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/thats-not-your-job">dandelion</a>, always be putting seeds out there.</p>
<p>Patience is directly proportional to duration:Â screw how long that tree is gonna take to grow; don&#8217;t even worry about it. Conversely,Â <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/when-to-start-getting-used-to-japanese">urgency isÂ <em>inversely</em> proportional to duration</a>. If it&#8217;s gonna take a while to bear fruit, then for that very reason, do what High Expectations Asian Father would tell you to do:Â <a href="http://highexpectationsasianfather.tumblr.com/">you plant now</a>!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just like how you give power to Russell Crow, I mean, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/movie-transcript-gladiator-speech-maximus-reveals-himselfin-japanese-of-course">Maximus</a>,Â <em></em><em>because</em>Â he doesn&#8217;t want it. You do the opposite of what your intuition wants to do. You build a new intuition &#8212; a new skill, a linguistic intuition &#8212; by ignoring your current one. You make planes by not flapping. You work with the fact that the Earth is round even though it looks flat.</p>
<p>But enough fake Asian talk from fake Asian dads. Get real: fire up your iPod and VLC and YouTube &#8212; start that Japanese playing again.</p>
<p>Be patient about effects. Be impatient about causes.</p>

Patience is not static. Patience isn&#8217;t sitting down and shutting up &#8212; that&#8217;s being cooperative and docile to help driving parents. Patience is dynamic. Patience is active preparation. Patience is doing.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not too preoccupied and too physically tired by active preparation to be worried, then you&#8217;re not being patient. You&#8217;re just being a whiny, sulky brat. And that&#8217;s fine, too. But don&#8217;t call it patience.</p>
<p>The patient language learner is watching some Japanese TV <em>right now</em>. She&#8217;s whipping out her iPhone and doing Surusu reps every time she gets five minutes here or there. She loves to whip things out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p><strong>Patience is silently busying yourself with doing things that help</strong>. Impatience is talking very loudly about how nothing works, while doing things that hurt.</p>
