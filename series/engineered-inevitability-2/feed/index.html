Hello? Denominations&#8230;</p>
<p>Counting language acquisition in years makes us think that we&#8217;ve been playing <em>way</em> harder than we actually have.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the years, it&#8217;s the minutes. It&#8217;s the<em> seconds.</em></p>
<p><strong>You can&#8217;t compare a stack of dollar bills to a stack of Benjamins and call them the same, playa.</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t tell me how many &#8220;years&#8221; you&#8217;ve been at the language.<br />
Tell me how many seconds.<br />
That&#8217;s seconds on task. Seconds on the bike, whether pedaling or coasting.</p>
<p>And, no, the time you spent being emo but not doing anything does not count.</p>

<p>I knew all I needed to do was change my environment. And that&#8217;s all I really &#8220;tried&#8221; to do, that&#8217;s the only place I made an effort. I am encouraging you to try the same. Not because you &#8220;should&#8221;, but because it&#8217;s the easy way out.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 3 of 4 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/engineered-inevitability-2/" class="series-145" title="Engineered Inevitability">Engineered Inevitability</a></div><p>Time by itself will do nothing. It&#8217;s engagement or the lack thereof multiplied by time that makes the difference.</p>
<p>So, if time &#8220;is&#8221; anything at all, it is at best a force multiplier. By itself, it&#8217;s powerless. Time multiplied by 0 gives you, well, 0. To mean anything, time needs to be crossed with choice.</p>
<p>Choice is where the real power is.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve waxed pop philosophical enough for one day. Let me wrap it up and bring it home.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; Japanese. Don&#8217;t &#8220;set aside time&#8221; for Japanese. Choose Japanese.</strong> Show up to Japanese. Then, just to be safe, lay down some suppression fire &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone">make other choices difficult, inconvenient, or impossible</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What we call time </strong>(in the sense of &#8220;you&#8217;ll get better with time&#8221;)<strong> is not time, it&#8217;s really the sum of our choices. </strong>It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/showing-up">sum of things we showed up to</a>. The sum of our showings up? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> They don&#8217;t have to be big choices. Not at all. They&#8217;re just choices. The simplest choice, the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/atomic-energy">atomic</a> choice, if you will, is a choice of direction. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/identity-and-self-fulfilling-prophecy">The sum of your directions determines your destination</a>&#8230;your &#8220;destiny&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, again, time will not make you better or worse. <strong>It&#8217;s not time, it&#8217;s times: the number of times</strong><strong> you choose</strong> to show up to Japanese &#8212; you will get as good at Japanese as this number is high.</p>
<p>Choose fun. Choose kanji <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 2 of 4 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/engineered-inevitability-2/" class="series-145" title="Engineered Inevitability">Engineered Inevitability</a></div><p>What deserves your closest attention is neither your ultimate goal, nor your track record, nor your overall plan, but your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">next</span> choice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What are you going to do next?</strong></p>
<p>Ultimate goals are heavy; they weigh on the soul. They&#8217;re useful and everything, but you can&#8217;t have them in your head all the time because the difference between that ultimate goal and your current state can be quite heart-crushingly large.</p>
<p>Track records can be depressing. You&#8217;re just going to be seeing all you haven&#8217;t been doing. I wouldn&#8217;t say <em>never</em> look at these, but if you don&#8217;t keep your exposure down, it will make you sick.</p>
<p>Overall plans are similarly crushing. The thought, the sight of all that&#8217;s still left to do &#8212; that long, empty, open road &#8212; is not exciting.</p>
<p>Which leaves your <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">next</span> choice</strong>. Your <strong>immediate next action</strong>.<br />
It&#8217;s just one thing.<br />
It&#8217;s simple.<br />
It&#8217;s practically instant gratification.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say your ultimate goal is Japanese fluency.<br />
Your track record is spotty or non-existent.<br />
Your overall plan is to follow something along the lines of AJATT/AntiMoon.</p>
<p>What is your next choice?<br />
Simple: Do something. Anything. In Japanese. Anything counts.<br />
ANYthing.<br />
Any. Thing.</p>
<p>One simple choice. Through this one simple choice. you&#8217;re bringing yourself closer to the ultimate goal; you&#8217;re building a new, better track record and you&#8217;re following the overall plan.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it.</p>
<p>When I say I am not smart, have no talent, and have no willpower, a lot of people think I&#8217;m being modest. Trust me. I am neither smart nor talented nor &#8220;disciplined&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>With Japanese, I just made simple, local choices. At every fork in the road, I chose Japanese.</strong> That is sum total of &#8220;the plan&#8221;. If there is truly no choice, then it&#8217;s obviously not a fork. But you would be surprised how many opportunities there are to fit Japanese in some crack somewhere somehow (because concurrency counts).</p>
<p>This is an incredibly dumb algorithm. It is so dumb that a computer could do it. Even a lazy, good-for-nothing boy from Kenya who forgets to shower all the time &#8212; such a boy could execute this algorithm.</p>
<p>Observe, a pseudocode implementation of the basic AJATT algorithm.</p>
<p>while ( breathing )<br />
if ( anyOpportunityExists )<br />
doJapanese(anything)<br />
else takeNextOpportunity(asap)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple. Make the big plans if you want. Keep the logs if you want. But know that the forks in the road are where things actually get decided.</p>
