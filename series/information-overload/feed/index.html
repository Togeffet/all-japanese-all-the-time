								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part  of 3 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/information-overload/" class="series-778" title="Information Overload">Information Overload</a></div><p>Information, in the relatively narrow modern sense, used to be expensive, so simply having it was more or less equivalent (or, at the very least, directly correlated to) wealth and power. At one time, merely possessing a marginally accurate map of some subset of the Earth&#8217;s surface, the kind of thing we now routinely stick in children&#8217;s atlases, was a huge deal, a state secret even.</p>
<p>But now, the real wealth and power is in packaging, filtering and combining information. So it&#8217;s more important to know how and what to discard than it is to collect. Curation, not collection, is the trick. Digestion, not dilation (what? I just wanted more alliteration, man, chill. You&#8217;d totally have done the same thing <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).</p>
<p>Much is made of how organizations like the NSA more or less illegally collect personal information. The concern is valid, but tempered by the fact that, absent decent filters, the intelligence community is left no more intelligent or entertained than a guy who indiscriminately downloads ebooks and movies beyond his capacity to sort, read or watch them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like some sickly twisted Greek tragedy, where the victim is punished by being given what he wants. You want movies? Here&#8217;s most of the feature films ever made and released in your language. Scrolling and searching through Netflix feels like a chore. So you just go to the movie theatre instead, to watch the best of whatever five pieces of crap are running right now.</p>
<p>Data collection is like object collection (hoarding) &#8212; the promise and potential of action destroyed by the constipation that its own presence induces. Not unlike a rocketship that has tons of fuel so it can go far, but can&#8217;t go anywhere, because it&#8217;s too heavy to lift itself. (Having said that, when it comes to Japanese immersion materials, I do encourage you to err slightly on the side of hoarding. SRS cards, though? Delete those suckers with extreme prejudice).</p>
<p>What about tea?</p>
<p>Tea used to be so expensive outside of the Sinosphere (so, like, in the West) that sellers would cut it with cheaper junk substances to bulk it up &#8212; a lot like the illegal street drugs of today. Information (again, in the modern sense), used to be so hard to come by we just actively made stuff up to fill in the gaps, drawing imaginary animals on maps with a straight face.</p>
<p>Of course, we still make stuff up, all the time, but it&#8217;s somewhat more passive and subconscious now, and we collectively refer to these processes as cognitive biases. Do we know everything? Of course not. Do we even know more about everything? Unfortunately, no. But it would be terribly smug, pessimistic and liberal-artsy to deny that we (again, collectively) know more about a lot. My friend Stacy honestly thinks that progress is a superficial illusion and human life in every period of human history has been largely the same. Stacy is a deep thinker. Stacy is also wrong.</p>
<p>When you drink tea, you don&#8217;t worry that you&#8217;re not &#8220;getting the real tea&#8221; just because you&#8217;re not chomping down tea leaves (like all analogies, this information-as-tea business breaks down here a bit, because there are situations where you want primary source information über alles, although, having said that, prioritizing primary sources over n-ary ones is itself a form of filtering, so&#8230;yeah&#8230;still right lol).</p>
<p>Many forms of information aren&#8217;t just useless or gross or bitter or poorly textured (like them tea leaves), they&#8217;re actually bad for you (think: news, boring SRS cards, most social media). Avoiding such information will always be a net positive in your life; the little good it contains does not justify continued exposure to it.</p>
<p>You get the idea. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve made many logical leaps and false historical claims in the preceding paragraphs &#8212; if I have, let me know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Also, you can learn more about the awesome history of tea and five other world-changing drinks right here: [歴史を変えた6つの飲物 ビール、ワイン、蒸留酒、コーヒー、茶、コーラが語る もうひとつの世界史 | トム スタンデージ, 新井 崇嗣 |本 | 通販 | Amazon] <a href="http://amzn.to/2umRaE4">amzn.to/2umRaE4</a></p>
<p>And here: [Amazon.co.jp： A History of the World in 6 Glasses: Tom Standage: 洋書] <a href="http://amzn.to/2unkWZA">amzn.to/2unkWZA</a></p>
<p>Standage is a super cool writer; easy, breezy and smart, his text reads like an episode of James Burke&#8217;s Connections, leaving you amazed, entertained, informed and enlightened all at the same time. Just so we&#8217;re clear, those are four very good things for a book to do to you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part  of 3 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/information-overload/" class="series-778" title="Information Overload">Information Overload</a></div><p>So, I&#8217;ve spilled quite a bit of digital ink on the subject of how to read books effectively. There was this thing I once wrote about called the<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-the-way-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-part-3-the-unified-reading-process/"> &#8220;URP&#8221; (Unified Reading Process)</a>. In my relative intellectual immaturity <a class="simple-footnote" title="Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m still intellectually immature, I was just even more immature back then&#8230;" id="return-note-30937-1" href="#note-30937-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, I expected it to be quite literally be the last word on reading.</p>
<p>It definitely occurs to me now that there is no last word on anything (and pretty much the moment we act like think there is, is the moment we start declining, whether as individuals or groups, altough the decline may take a very long time to become visible.) &#8212; We&#8217;re always improving, always discovering, always 改善ing</p>
[One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way: Robert Maurer Ph.D.: 9780761180326: <a href="http://Amazon.com" class="autohyperlink">Amazon.com</a>: Books] <a href="http://amzn.to/2th329X">amzn.to/2th329X</a></p>
<p>Um, so, let&#8217;s just keep it short and sweet for now and flesh out the details later. There is far too much visual information in the world. Not that that&#8217;s a bad thing &#8212; we never have to be bored any more, and that&#8217;s wonderful.</p>
<p>However, this embarrassment of visual riches definitely does mean that if I, say, read a book, and take a screenshot, and underline that screenshot and save that underlined screenshot in Evernote, then all I&#8217;ve really done is created another piece of visual info that, good intentions notwithstanding, I am unlikely to ever refer to again.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the solution? Easy.</p>
<p>1. Get an IC recorder. No matter where you live, you should try to get a Japanese model; they&#8217;re better &#8212; way better &#8212; than anything you&#8217;ll get anywhere else. It&#8217;s not good enough to buy a Sony voice recorder made for overseas markets; you wanna get a Japanese unit made for the domestic Japanese market. No, wait, let me rephrase that. You can get a perfectly serviceable IC recorder outside of Japan, and it will be good enough to get the job done, but, for the same price or less, you can get an awesome one in or from Japan, with sexy DSP features like on-the-fly noise-cancelling that can literally suppress the sound of a roaring subway train, leaving only your voice. [Amazon | OLYMPUS ICレコーダー VoiceTrek 4GB MicroSD対応 V-842 ライムグリーン V-842 LGR | ボイスレコーダー 通販] <a href="http://amzn.to/2tgKZjU">amzn.to/2tgKZjU</a></p>
<p>2. Keep the IC recorder around your neck on a lanyard.</p>
<p>3. When you come to a cool part of a book, instead of highlighting the note, read it out into the IC recorder. If you come to a word you don&#8217;t know how to read, you can pause the recording, look it up, and then resume. Barely a beat skipped (recordingwise). Problem solved.</p>
<p>a. If you can and want to, you can also make a recording of the dictionary definition. Get yourself a learning twofer (a double whammy).</p>
<p>4. Every day or so, copy (move) your recorded tracks off of your IC recorder and onto your music player.</p>
<p>6. If your music player happens to be say, an Android tablet or smartphone, then you can make it so that you use two music apps at the same time but set both to ignore audio focus (PowerAmp and Neutron are good for this). This allows simultaneous audio playback of different files and playlists. One app plays your voice recordings, the other plays background music. It&#8217;s like suddenly having music with far more interesting lyrical topics than the usual two or three (love/conspicuous consumption/lost love). So now you&#8217;re a DJ, too. LoL.</p>
<p>a. [Poweramp &#8211; Google Play の Android アプリ] <a href="https://goo.gl/bqBkw">goo.gl/bqBkw</a></p>
<p>b. [Neutron Music Player &#8211; Google Play の Android アプリ] <a href="https://goo.gl/8EMZGA">goo.gl/8EMZGA</a></p>
<p>7. That music mixing thing is worthy of its own discussion at a later time. We&#8217;ll definitely come back to it and unpack it; it was the happy result of a great deal of desire, happy frustration and experimentation.</p>

There has always been a lot of information, he said &#8212; at the very least for all of the time that life has existed on earth and probably even for most of the life of our universe. When we experience the feeling of information overload, then, what we&#8217;re suffering from is not an actual (new) overabundance of information but a collapse or failure or absence of filter(ing mechanism)s. Or so the thinking goes.</p>
<p>That was a really poorly written paragraph, but it made sense the first time I wrote it, and (hopefully) it&#8217;ll make sense the tenth time you read it.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: ignore and discard more stuff.</p>
<p>You know, when you sit down and write it out like this, it does sound like a bit of a &#8220;guns don&#8217;t kill people, I do&#8221; line of reasoning &#8212; factually accurate, but decidedly unhelpful to the dead. Having said that, in a reverse analogy to the way that overly strict gun laws primarily disarm law-abiding citizens (hence harming rather than helping), the idea that we need (to create and use) more and better filters gives us leverage, a fulcrum point, a target, a place and thing at which to productively direct our energies.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t whine that your house is full or too small (&#8220;them doors is too narrow!&#8221;). Let less in and throw more out.</p>
<p>In terms of Japanese and SRS cards, that means delete more, and add cards primarily/exclusively from easy-to-add digital sources.</p>
