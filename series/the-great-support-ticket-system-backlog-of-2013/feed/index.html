Total failure. Pretty much.<br />
And it&#8217;s my fault, not yours.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re going back to email &#8212; where things make more sense. But with a twist (more addresses, more eyes on the email, including Veronica&#8217;s).<br />
The support ticket system is being phased out.<br />
Here are the new email addresses if you need help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact | AJATT | All Japanese All The Time &#8211; <a href="http://is.gd/Nthycy" class="autohyperlink">is.gd/Nthycy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PS:ã€€And you thought I was joking when I talked about being imperfect <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s called Biohazard in Japan, Khatz!&#8221;</p>
<p>STFU and leave me alone! Anyway, this is a little update to let you know that a human being named Veronica is now, quite literally, taking care of business as far as <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/contact">support ticket system issues</a> are concerned. Veronica is a real grown-up, with real children. And, well, you know what that means?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right &#8212; she puts out the fires that my wanton, childish incompetence have created; she is order personified and she eats chaos for breakfast and then spits it out like&#8230;sugar cane <a class="simple-footnote" title="I know you. You were thinking: &#8220;here comes an eating disorder joke&#8221;. Well, no bulimia humor for you: it&#8217;s a disease, man, not a punchline&#8230;geez." id="return-note-25727-1" href="#note-25727-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. It&#8217;s like having, I dunno, adult supervision.</p>
<p>So she&#8217;s &#8212; we&#8217;ve &#8212; been at it for 2 weeks now. At this pace, another 2 weeks and everything should be back to normal backlogwise. Again, I&#8217;ll keep you posted on developments. Take care and thanks a bunch for your patience.</p>

<p>This is just a quick note to let you know a little something.<br />
<strong>The support ticket (suptic) system is broken.</strong> Partially in technical sense (overrun by spam), but mostly in a human way (me). In fact, almost completely in a human way; spam is just an excuse. Anyway, AJATT has grown to the point that the sheer volume of requests, both spam and ham, was too much for me to handle personally. Overwhelming load, etc. I know, cry you a river, right? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>So, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you created a support ticket of any kind (technical, billing, etc.) between May 1 and June 30, it may or may not have been gotten to yet. Emphasis on the &#8220;not&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Someone is being hired right now so that this never has to happen again</span></strong>. More accurately, they&#8217;ve been hired already; they should be on the job by the middle of this week.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Please accept my deepest and most sincere apologies for leaving you hanging so long. It&#8217;s totally my fault, not yours.</strong> Consider it a growing pains thing. And now, for the first time in AJATT history, there&#8217;ll actually be someone competent (i.e. not me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="ðŸ˜›" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) whose whole job it is to make sure that your support ticket requests get handled in a timely and expeditious fashion.</p>
<p>Over the next 3~4 weeks, we&#8217;ll clear out the spam, work through the backlog of getting back to you, and get back to getting back to you in a timely fashion. Trust me, that was English.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your continued patience. Will keep you posted as things develop&#8230;</p>
