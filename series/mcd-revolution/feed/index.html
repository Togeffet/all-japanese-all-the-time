								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 8 of 8 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/mcd-revolution/" class="series-147" title="MCD Revolution">MCD Revolution</a></div><p>As a general rule, I have tended to eschew tactical learning advice in favor of the strategic. Tactics are (superficially) quicker and easier to deal with, and we all need to experience the joy of rubber meeting the road, the beauty of that friction, the traction of reality, the simple pleasure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(gaming)">grinding</a>&#8230;BUT&#8230;because they can be applied in the total absence of an understanding of the philosophy (i.e. strategy) behind them,<strong> context-free tactics also tend to lead to dogmatism, misunderstanding and self-harm</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, <strong>we all need tactics and I would be doing a disservice if I didn&#8217;t share some of mine with you</strong> (like I&#8217;m about to do now) but we also need to realize that<strong> tactics must needs be mutable</strong> where strategy is more permanent. Tactics are like the wind. Strategy is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=北斗の拳&amp;num=100">(fist of the) north star</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah. Tactics. Here we go. Um&#8230;up until now, the general advice (from me) on how to make MCD cards was that you should remove any and all furigana (kanji readings) from the front of the card. So the front of your base card (before inserting the clozes) would look like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>【半値】<br />
定価の半分。半分の値段。 「半値以下に値下げする」</p></blockquote>
<p>After several months of experimentation, I am pleased to inform you that this is not necessary &#8212; and that you actually want to<strong> leave the furigana there, right on the front of the card</strong>, so:</p>
<blockquote><p>はんね<br />
【半値】<br />
定価の半分。半分の値段。 「半値以下に値下げする」</p></blockquote>
<p>And include it as part of your base clozetexts, so: はんね 半値<br />
Remember, these are <em>base</em> clozetexts, so <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B5%84%E5%90%88%E3%81%9B%E7%88%86%E7%99%BA">combinatorial explosion</a> applies, meaning that you actually end up with (in this case) nine clozetexts, like so: はん　ね　半値　半　値　は　んね　半値　ん<br />
Surusu, the world&#8217;s sexiest SRS, handles the creation of extra clozetexts for you; just give it the base clozetexts and set &#8220;JPNZ (n00b) (Japanese newbie)&#8221; as your clozemode.</p>
<p>Why does this work? Short answer: it just does. Long answer: it gives extra context, which is always good, and makes the card easier without making it too easy;<strong> it&#8217;s especially valuable to leave the furigana on the front of the card when you&#8217;re trying to learn <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/固有名詞"><em>proper</em> <em>names (i.e. proper nouns)</em></a></strong>, which tend to lack intrinsic <a class="simple-footnote" title="not sure if this the right word, but oh well" id="return-note-31149-1" href="#note-31149-1"><sup>1</sup></a> meaning. Obviously, proper nouns in Japanese transparently mean something because kanji mean something, but &#8220;<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/豊臣秀吉">豊臣秀吉</a>&#8221; does not mean &#8220;ancient awesome samurai guy&#8221;; it&#8217;s just a certain ancient awesome samurai dude&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Also, leaving furigana on the front turns your learning into a <strong>divide-and-conquer</strong> proposition, and this is a good thing. A very good thing. Specifically, we <strong>separate learning (testing) the readings</strong> of a new word <strong>from testing kanji knowledge</strong> of that same word. Ironically, while this makes each individual card easier, it actually sharpens your knowledge of both kanji and readings, and, going forward, prevents &#8220;native-like forgetfulness&#8221; where you can accurately produce a reading but not necessarily always a kanji from memory (the whole &#8220;I can read &#8216;Massachusetts&#8217; but not spell it correctly&#8221; effect).</p>
<p>Note that this doesn&#8217;t make the old, &#8220;no-furigana-on-the-front&#8221; cards obsolete, it just adds a new dimension, another card style, to your toolbelt.</p>
<p>If none of the above made any sense to you, don&#8217;t worry about it. Just get the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-is-dead-long-live-mcds/">MCD Revolution Kit</a> to learn more and get up to speed <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . It&#8217;s all in there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 7 of 8 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/mcd-revolution/" class="series-147" title="MCD Revolution">MCD Revolution</a></div><p>Never say I never did nothing for the peoples!</p>
<p>To commemorate the beginning October&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Coz I&#8217;m all about commemorating October&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;Myeah, not really&#8230;</p>
<p>But just for the heck of it anyway, here are a dozen free, real-life (i.e. from or inspired by actual cards in my actual decks) examples of MCDs. There are three basic types. Bilingual, <del>tranny I mean</del> transitional, and monolingual. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Yes, I do hate transgender people. They start all the wars and take all our jobs. All. Of. Them." id="return-note-7707-1" href="#note-7707-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>Some people give you roses. Some sacrifice virgins. I give you SRS card examples that make your learning fun, easy and effective. I think it&#8217;s quite clear who&#8217;s <em>really</em> looking out for your best interests <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> : the virgin-sacrificing people; they&#8217;re really going all out. But I imagine I&#8217;m a close second.</p>
<p>Remember, the basic MCD principle is this: instead of having 1 card with 9 unknowns, you have 9 cards with 1 unknown each. But you keep the same <em>massive</em> context as when you had a single big, bad, intimidating, f-off card. 9 is a fake number.</p>
<p>Talk longa. Action brevis. Begin!</p>
<p>First things first, here is the format for these examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>FRONT<span style="color: #c0c0c0;"><strong><br />
</strong>BACK</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The front contains the cloze (the blank represented by <span style="color: #ff9900;">＃＃＃＃＃＃＃＃</span> or some other equally awesome marker).<br />
The back contains the clozetext (the correct answer to the blank; the filler to the donut hole, if you will) as well as additional materials like definitions, readings, sound files and any other relevant reference material.</p>
<h2>Bilingual</h2>
<p>Bilingual MCDs are good for when you lack the knowledge &#8212; or the context &#8212; to happily handle monolingual cards. Beginners, noobs and nervous nellies should focus just on bilingual cards. Just as with old skool sentence cards, <em>don&#8217;t go writing your own translations</em>. If you&#8217;re noob enough to need a translation, ya shouldn&#8217;t be rolling your own.</p>

<h2>Transitional</h2>
<p><del>Tranny <a class="simple-footnote" title="Don&#8217;t worry&#8230;it&#8217;s not raciss&#8230;they don&#8217;t have feelings like you and I" id="return-note-7707-2" href="#note-7707-2"><sup>2</sup></a> I mean</del> transitional cards are useful for when you&#8217;re trying to crack the same risqué joke twice in a single blogpost, or just actively making the (get this) transition <a class="simple-footnote" title="do you see what I did there?" id="return-note-7707-3" href="#note-7707-3"><sup>3</sup></a> to using monolingual dictionaries. Basically, they&#8217;re MCDs of dictionary definitions of simple words you already know. <strong>The front of the card is monolingual, the back of the card is bilingual </strong>(so we have an English definition of the definition we&#8217;re clozing). Contrast with bilingual cards, which are bilingual on both sides, and monolingual cards, which are monolingual on both sides.</p>

<h2>Monolingual</h2>
<p>Monolingual cards are especially well-suited to long, context-rich passages of L2 text. Having said that, they will of course work on short passages as well: they don&#8217;t know how long your passage is <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get how these are working, don&#8217;t worry: you&#8217;re not supposed to get it&#8230;yet. Focus first on bilingual and transitional cards. Get a few thousand of those under your belt. Your time will come.</p>

<p>For example, maybe you aren&#8217;t really into this episode of &#8220;Is the Food Delicious or Not?&#8221; but the remote is out of arm&#8217;s reach, and you&#8217;re pretty comfortably settled onto the couch, and you have an adorable cat lying on top of you. Guess what you&#8217;ll end up watching.</p>
<p>Well, there’s good news for us lazy slobs. MCDs are insanely easy to make.</p>
<p>Surusu can create up to 512 MCDs in a single click.</p>
<p>Not a Surusu user? AJATT+ member tokyostyle created<a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/srs/anki-plugin-for-mcd-support"> a plugin for Anki that automatically generates MCDs</a>. As if this didn’t get him enough awesome points, he constantly checks feedback and suggestions from the users who post their comments in the thread and updates/tweaks the plugin accordingly.</p>
<p>Copy/pasted for non-AJATT+ members:</p>

<p>4. Click OK</p>
<p>5. Restart Anki</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deck Preparation</p>
<p>1. Open your Sentences or MCD deck.</p>
<p>2. Click Settings -&gt; Deck Properties …</p>
<p>3. Click the &#8220;Add&#8221; button</p>
<p>4. Select &#8220;Add: Japanese MCD&#8221; and click OK</p>
<p>5. Close the Deck Properties window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding MCD Cards</p>
<p>1. Open your Sentences / MCD deck</p>
<p>2. Click Tools -&gt; Add MCD Cards OR Press F9</p>
<p>3. Paste the passage you want to learn into the &#8220;Text&#8221; box</p>
<p>4. Add any notes you want on the back of the card to the &#8220;Notes&#8221; box</p>
<p>5. Add the words, kanji, kana, etc. you want clozed in the Clozes box</p>
<p>6. Make sure all of your clozes have spaces between them!</p>
<p>7. Add any tags you want these cards to have</p>

<blockquote><p>My hunch (and limited experience) is that <a title="MCDs" href="http://plus.ajatt.com/srs-sentence-card-format-massive-context-cloze-deletion-cards-mcds">MCDs</a> convert into output faster and more accurately than the <a title="“original glazed” sentence cards" href="../10000-sentences-how" target="_blank">“original glazed” sentence cards</a> because we’re doing a <a title="deeper form of practice" href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/book-review-the-talent-code-greatness-isnt-born-its-grown-heres-how" target="_blank">deeper form of practice</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/khatzumotos-learning-journal-mcds-and-output">[link] </a></p>
<p>Both vanilla sentences and MCDs familiarize you with the language and expose you to vocab and syntax, but the key difference is that sentences are passive whereas MCDs are active.</p>
<p>This active form of practice leads to easier, faster, and more natural output.</p>
<blockquote><p>I find that I use MCDs simply for writing.  &#8230; I already knew what it meant from the Kanji and also from my sentence deck.  I knew what it meant but I couldn&#8217;t write it. &#8230;</p>
<p>中華料理…<strong>I can write that on command thanks to MCDs.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/sentencesphrases/i-feel-like-mcds-are-slowing-me-down/#p4974">[link]</a></p>
<p>I personally don&#8217;t use MCDs exclusively.</p>
<p>I love my vanilla sentence deck, and I still add to it daily. But I&#8217;ve found that MCDs are amazing for helping me memorize <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E5%AD%97%E7%86%9F%E8%AA%9E">四字熟語</a>. Before experimenting with MCDs, I had a few 四字熟語 in my sentence deck, but I could only recognize and read them. I couldn&#8217;t write them out from memory.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve gotten into MCDs, I can write those suckers one right after the other without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how I would use MCDs to learn <a href="http://www.sanabo.com/words/archives/2004/12/post_2.html">合縁奇縁</a>:</p>
<p>Front:</p>
<p align="left">親同士がすすめた結婚で、お互いに不安だらけのスタートでしたが、まさに<span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXXX</span>縁奇縁、たいした喧嘩もせずに、いつのまにか50年になりました。</p>
<p>Back:</p>
<p>合<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p align="left">合縁奇縁　あいえんきえん</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Front:</p>
<p align="left">親同士がすすめた結婚で、お互いに不安だらけのスタートでしたが、まさに合<span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXXX</span>奇縁、たいした喧嘩もせずに、いつのまにか50年になりました。</p>
<p>Back:</p>
<p>縁<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p align="left">合縁奇縁　あいえんきえん</p>
<p>Front:</p>
<p align="left">親同士がすすめた結婚で、お互いに不安だらけのスタートでしたが、まさに合縁<span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXXX</span>縁、たいした喧嘩もせずに、いつのまにか50年になりました。</p>
<p>Back:</p>
<p>奇<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p align="left">合縁奇縁　あいえんきえん</p>
<p>Front:</p>
<p align="left">親同士がすすめた結婚で、お互いに不安だらけのスタートでしたが、まさに合縁奇<span style="color: #ff0000;">XXXXX</span>、たいした喧嘩もせずに、いつのまにか50年になりました。</p>
<p>Back:</p>
<p>縁<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p align="left">合縁奇縁　あいえんきえん</p>
<p align="left">I would also add a vanilla sentence card with no cloze deletions just for learning the readings.</p>
<p align="left">Based on what I&#8217;ve read at the AJATT+ forums, some users love MCDs and have completely scrapped the sentence method. Some have tried MCDs and found that sentences were a better match. Others, like myself, are experimenting with a combination of both. Some write out their MCD answers, others don&#8217;t <a class="simple-footnote" title="They just say them aloud or whatever" id="return-note-6580-1" href="#note-6580-1"><sup>1</sup></a>: I know that Khatz is lazy, so he can&#8217;t be bothered. See what works best for you.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">simplicity</a> can&#8217;t be stressed enough.</p>
<p>Back in my misled <em>ganbaru</em> days of learning Japanese, I used to make cards for writing kanji compounds that looked like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FRONT:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">りょうり</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">cooking</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BACK:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">料理</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t look so bad, does it? But it is. It&#8217;s a bad, bad card. Bad. This ↑ is <strong>not</strong> how to learn. Not effectively.</p>
<p>Never quiz yourself on two kanji at once. Unless you&#8217;re simultaneously writing with a pencil in your left hand and your right hand, you will never write two kanji at one time. No matter what you&#8217;re writing, whether it&#8217;s 元気 or 財団法人自治体国際化協会, <strong>you&#8217;re going to write it one kanji at a time</strong>.</p>
<p>After struggling with MCDs in the beginning, forum sempai 安藤 sees the light:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once they finally clicked for me, it was like a new world opening up. &#8230; I honestly couldn&#8217;t see myself finally learning terms like 注意欠陥・多動性障害 or 朝鮮民主主義人民共和国 with the &#8220;traditional&#8221; sentence card format, but, as should be obvious from the fact that I totally just typed those out from memory, <strong>I can learn them super-easily now since instead of having one card with a nine kanji term I&#8217;ve gotta remember, I&#8217;ve got nine cards with one kanji to remember.</strong> 1/9th of the difficulty!</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/ajatt-blog-posts/srs-sentence-card-format-massive-context-cloze-deletion-cards-mcds/#p2264">[link]</a></p>
<p>MCDs = Making hard stuff easy. Making you rock at [foreign language of choice].</p>

<p>Why use MCDs? Instead of answering that myself, I&#8217;ll just quote some forum sempais:</p>
<p>ダンちゃん:</p>
<blockquote><p>Individual MCD cards have a lot more character for me. &#8230;This seems to make it <strong>easier to remember the words linked to them</strong>. &#8230;I love how much easier it is to make them. Copy, paste, cloze, repeat several times for same material &#8230; It also pressures you towards <strong>choosing authentic content</strong> over example sentences provided by dictionaries.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/srs/so-i-deleted-my-sentence-deck/#p3679">[link]</a></p>
<p>Drewskie:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s so much more fun to grab whole posts and paragraphs&#8230; Taking things whole preserves a lot of the material&#8217;s character and context, which makes reading the cards a lot more fun, which of course <strong>makes doing reps a lot more fun</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/srs/so-i-deleted-my-sentence-deck/#p3681">[link]</a></p>
<p>stevie:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve found MCDs are a<strong> LOT less painless</strong> (and seem to have a much <strong>better retention rate</strong>) than sentence cards where I was finding it pretty much impossible, or at least very little fun, to do I+1 given how many words and character readings I don&#8217;t know in Mandarin.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/general/mcds-im-not-getting-it/#p2798">[link]</a></p>
<p>ダンちゃん:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having a part hidden that I have to guess seems to make things more fun. I guess because I can show off to myself by &#8216;winning&#8217; the game.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/srs/arent-cloze-deletions-great/#p2987">[link]</a></p>
<p>Drewskie</p>
<blockquote><p> Having eliminated all barriers to 2ch, I&#8217;m finding that exploring different boards and making MCDs out of posts and conversations is probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had while sentence mining.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/srs/so-i-deleted-my-sentence-deck/#p3681"> [link]</a></p>
<p>dtcamero</p>
<blockquote><p> Personally I think the cleverness of the MCD is in adding compelling context to sentence cards. Otherwise they get boring and boredom is the enemy…</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/srs/so-i-deleted-my-sentence-deck/#p3692">[link]</a></p>
<p>RevenantKioku</p>
<blockquote><p>The strange thing was MCDs made me feel less badder about failing them and more gooder about getting them right.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/general/mcds-im-not-getting-it/#p2808">[link]</a></p>
<p>stevie</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s just amazing how fast I can go from grabbing a news article on more or less anything &#8230; and in some cases go from under 50% understanding to 100%.  &#8230;  MCDs make this <strong>easy, fast, fun</strong>, and with an instant payoff in terms of understanding.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/forum/general/mcds-im-not-getting-it/page-2/#p2969">[link]</a></p>
<p>In summary: using sources you are interested in and combining lots of context with simple cloze deletions, MCDs help you learn more, make reading easier, and improve recall and output.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 2 of 8 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/mcd-revolution/" class="series-147" title="MCD Revolution">MCD Revolution</a></div><p>In the summer of 2010, I innocently started experimenting with a new <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-is-an-srs">SRS</a> technique.<br />
Easy, effortless and effective, the technique rapidly ballooned in scope, creatively destroying all that came before it.<br />
It worked. Devastatingly well.<br />
On October 18, 2010, my sentence deck breathed its final breath, and the <em>&#8220;10,000 Sentences&#8221; method</em> literally died, a happy victim of the very process that had brought it about: experimentation and discovery.</p>
<p>All the while, only a select group of people even knew this was all happening.<br />
Despite &#8212; or perhaps because of &#8212; their massive impact and the implications for the future of getting used to languages, the technique &#8212; MCDs &#8212; remained a closely guarded secret.<br />
And time wore on&#8230;<br />
&#8220;MCD&#8221;. An enigma. Wrapped in a conundrum. Wrapped in a mystery. Wrapped in a cryptic acronym. Wrapped in&#8230;.I dunno&#8230;my bad writing.<br />
Only people in AJATT Plus (and, later, SilverSpoon) were allowed to know the whole truth and enjoy the benefits of this amazing technique.<br />
Until now.</p>
<h1>Dude, WTF Are MCDs Anyway?</h1>
<p>Language. In a word, &#8220;Massive-Context Cloze Deletions&#8221; or &#8220;Massive Context Cloze-Deletion Cards&#8221;.</p>
<h1>So They All Have To Be Massive?</h1>
<p>No, there is such a thing as miniMCDs or μMCDs (microMCDs).</p>
<h1>Why Do You Keep Making Up New Acronyms?</h1>
<p>To impress your mom? How do you expect me to even answer a question like that? Your mom and I love each other, okay? And that&#8217;s all there is to it. She deserves to be happy. She deserves to be with an acronymic man.</p>
<h1>How Can You Do This To Us?! How Can We Ever Trust You Again? You Keep Effing Changing Methods!</h1>
<p>Look. I know I&#8217;m young and thin and beautiful and handsome, okay? I know I have nice thighs and a perky butt, okay? I know I look like Michelangelo&#8217;s David, okay? Wait&#8230;pull back. But you know what? Even I&#8217;m not perfect<strong>. The so-called AJATT method not changing would mean that it was perfect when it came out.</strong> That simply isn&#8217;t the case. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It&#8217;s an amazing method. But you know what? It can get even more amazing.</p>
<p>There is no AJATT &#8220;canon&#8221;, in my opinion. Or if there is, it&#8217;s an open canon.</p>
<p>To me, AJATT is more than a set of techniques, it&#8217;s a mindset, a meta-method. A method of methods. Method of methods in the sense that it&#8217;s the dog&#8217;s bollocks, but also method of methods in the sense that it&#8217;s an approach to method itself. The true &#8220;AJATT method&#8221;, the meta-method is: do what&#8217;s fun, do what works; answer to no one but the results.</p>
<p>The true &#8220;AJATT method&#8221;, the higher, deeper &#8220;AJATT method&#8221;, is not about being bound by tradition. Even your own tradition.</p>
<p>Do you think human history ended when fingers went to keyboard and the first five AJATT posts came out? Do you really think&#8230;oh my gosh, I just snorted ginger tea up my nose&#8230;where were we&#8230;ow&#8230;hot&#8230;yeah, no, but&#8230;I may have written the best word when it comes to getting used to languages <a class="simple-footnote" title="I say this in all seriousness&#8230;I don&#8217;t think I have the best ideas, but the ideas on this website are easily among the best you will find written down. Many folk have great ideas, I would even venture that most people in the world have way better ideas than me &#8212; I spend most of my time thinking of your Mom &#8212; but few bother to try them out, and of those that try them out, fewer still bother to record, collect and share their ideas and results. AJATT is not the best that could be, but it is the best that is, the best you could find. Is Steve Pavlina the wisest man alive? No, but his is certainly the best PD writing you&#8217;re going to find online, period." id="return-note-6605-1" href="#note-6605-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, but I certainly didn&#8217;t write the last word.</p>
<p>Things change. Things evolve. Things get better. Things get faster. Things get easier.</p>
<h1>Does This Mean That Ye Olde Sentence Method is Broken?</h1>
<p>Well, was your cable connection &#8220;broken&#8221; when you switched to fiber optic?<br />
Are mountain paths &#8220;broken&#8221; because stairs exist?<br />
Are stairs &#8220;broken&#8221; because we have elevators?<br />
No, you just moved on. You can still connect via cable; cable still works, but you use optical fiber now. &#8216;Coz it&#8217;s better. It&#8217;s faster.<br />
That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened here with MCDs.</p>
<h1>How Can We Be Sure Whether This Shiz Works? I Need Guarantees!</h1>
<p>Oh, please. Funnily enough, that&#8217;s exactly what people said about the so-called sentence method of AntiMoon. Indeed, it&#8217;s exactly what I thought: <em>can it really be this easy</em>?<br />
I approached the whole sentences thing with intense skepticism. But I suspended my disbelief and just gave it a try.</p>
<p>I ran experiments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the scientific method (well, kinda), baby. We let the results speak for themselves. We let the results do the talking. Not authority. OK, &#8220;scientific&#8221; is a bit of a strong word to describe what we/I do. Probably the word we&#8217;re looking for is &#8220;empirical&#8221;. Be skeptical if you want, but don&#8217;t use skepticism as an excuse for stagnation and inaction. Be empirical <a class="simple-footnote" title="That&#8230;doesn&#8217;t sound like good English :P" id="return-note-6605-2" href="#note-6605-2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Be an empiricist about this.</p>
<h1>So How Should I Go About Getting Into This MCD Thing?</h1>
<p>Slow down, tiger. Chill, Winston. Whoa there, big boy. I only <em>just</em> got outta bed with your Mom. Relax. I&#8217;m gonna show and tell you how in a sec&#8230;</p>
<h1>So Should I Delete All My Sentence Cards?</h1>
<p>First of all, there is no &#8220;should&#8221; in AJATT (pedants, do me a favor here: don&#8217;t Google search &#8220;site: <a href="http://alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog" class="autohyperlink">alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog</a> should&#8221; and count the number of matches for the word &#8220;should&#8221; just to embarass me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> )</p>
<p>Mmmm&#8230;I mean, you could if you want.<br />
But there&#8217;s no need to do anything that drastic right away unless you really want to.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t.<br />
What I would do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a new, separate, MCD-only deck</li>
<li>Fill it with stuff I love (as you&#8217;re going to learn how to do in &#8220;MCD Revolution&#8221;)</li>
<li>Use Surusu&#8217;s custom functions (e.g. &#8220;Spinoff Card&#8221;) to convert some of your favorite and/or most problematic sentence cards into MCD cards.</li>
</ol>
<p>But that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there&#8217;s no reason that both methods can&#8217;t co-exist.<br />
It&#8217;s not an either/or thing. I mean, I find MCDs to be awesome and better, and so do most people who taste the fruit of the MCD tree. I eventually made a total switch to the MCD way. And my entire sentence deck went the way of the dinosaurs (back in October 2010), resulting in the literal death of 10,000 sentences &#8212; actually about 15,0000 sentence cards died that day &#8212; in name and in form. But you might be that chick who <em>only</em> gets turned on by being kissed on her elbow [insert Mom joke], and that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I started using MCDs for getting used to Japanese. It was a whole summer&#8217;s experimenting (back in 2010), and I didn&#8217;t say goodbye to my sentence deck until that Fall. Elite groups of AJATTeers have been using it with great success since about the same time. It takes me time to transition, and it may take you time as well. Probably less time than me, because I already done blazed a trail for you and all. But still.</p>
<h1>Why The Motherloving Heckshizzle Did It Take You So Long To Tell The World About MCDs?</h1>
<blockquote><p>You’ve waited this long to announce [MCDs] on PORAB [The Plain Ol&#8217; Regular AJATT Blog &#8212; i.e. outside AJATT Plus and other premium services]? Meaning everyone has been continuing with sentence decks this whole time?! That’s heartless!<br />

<h1>Does This Mean All The Sentence Packs You Done Sold Us Are Now Crapola?</h1>
<p>Not at all. Absolutely not. Not by any means. Sentence packs work perfectly well with MCDs, and I&#8217;ll show you exactly how to make them work&#8230;</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s In It For Me? What Are MCDs Going To Do For Me? How Do <em>I</em> Benefit? Why Should I Bother?</h1>
<p>Dude. There are <em>way</em> too many reasons to list here, but since you asked, and since you deserve to know, I&#8217;ma give you a little snippet from <em><a href="http://lib.ajatt.com/mcd-101/">MCD 101: 101 Reasons Why You Should Switch to MCDs — Learn About the Secret Technique That Has Killed, Pwned and Destroyed Sentences (All 10,000 of Them)</a></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>MCDs teach good, adult reading skills — they teach you to use context but not become bogged down in it.</li>
<li>MCDs allow you to access more fun, interesting and varied content.</li>
<li>MCDs themselves are more fun, interesting and varied content.</li>
<li><strong>MCDs free you from the shackles, the crushingly unnatural brevity of short, near-context-less sentences</strong>. You don’t have to learn boring, disconnected stuff just because you’re a beginner. You don&#8217;t have to keep things short for the sake of quick reps even though you&#8217;re advanced.</li>
<li>MCDs (ironically) also free you from the mental and physical burden of overly long sentence cards.</li>
<li><strong>MCDs work for all levels of language game &#8212; beginner, intermediate or advanced</strong>. They are sufficiently challenging for advanced players, but (paradoxically enough) also forgiving of the incomplete knowledge of early-stage players = beginners = noobs, because you only have to get the hidden text right.</li>
<li>Because they give you a more powerful &#8220;workout&#8221; &#8212; deeper practice &#8212; MCDs build powerful predictive capabilities<em> </em>(“in this context, it’s most natural to say XYZ”), the <em>sine qua non</em> of fluency in a language. Lots of power going on here.</li>
<li>MCDs are low-stress and easy to do reps on, because there is only a <strong>single point of comparison/failure</strong> (that point may be repeated within a single card, but it’s the same point). MCDs turn a mountain of learning into a flight of stairs, or, with Surusu&#8217;s automated card generation&#8230;an elevator journey.</li>
<li>MCDs train both vocabulary and grammar, easily and virtually effortlessly — no need for you to make <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-about-languages-with-tons-of-inflection-or-the-world-is-flat">arbitrary — and perhaps even false — distinctions</a> between the two any more.</li>
<li>Says Kalek, an AJATT Pluser: &#8220;<strong>my understanding of both written text and speech has gone through the roof</strong> since beginning MCDs.&#8221; | Massive-Context Cloze-Deletion Cards (MCDs) | AJATT Blog Posts | Forum | AJATT Plus <a title="http://j.mp/hkpQ34" href="http://j.mp/hkpQ34">j.mp/hkpQ34</a></li>
<li>MCDs are easy to make &#8212; especially in Surusu, where you can generate them automatically.</li>
<li>The MCD technique is unique to AJATT. While it was inspired by SuperMemo and Daniel Coyle&#8217;s <em>Talent Code</em>, there&#8217;s nothing quite like it anywhere else &#8212; be it SuperMemo, AntiMoon or even WikiPedia. In fact, the examples in those sources would make very bad (difficult, ineffective) MCDs.</li>
<li>MCDs are an embodiment of the AJATT principle of &#8220;engineered inevitably&#8221; &#8212; they enable you to memorize and internalize information speedily and effortlessly.</li>
<li>MCDs are topic- and <strong>language-agnostic</strong>. They&#8217;ll work for Japanese, Chinese, ophthalmology exams, European languages&#8230;and impressing your Mom.</li>
<li>Learning &#8212; which is to say, getting used to &#8212; a language used to be like climbing a mountain. With MCDs, it&#8217;s like taking a gentle flight of stairs. <strong>Everything becomes i+1</strong>, because we&#8217;re only ever handling one thing at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What Has Other People&#8217;s Experience With MCDs Been?</h1>
<p>Here&#8217;s just some of what AJATT Plusers and SilverSpooners have had to say about MCDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>ダンちゃん (Danchan): “SRS can be about engagement with the language, immersion if you will, rather than a break from it. <strong>It’s Krashen’s basic principle enhanced by the steroids of SRS</strong>.” [Emphasis added]  | The Death of 10,000 Sentences | AJATT Blog Posts | Forum | AJATT Plus <a title="http://j.mp/y5Oyzo" href="http://j.mp/y5Oyzo">j.mp/y5Oyzo</a></li>
<li>sargon: “<strong>MCDs have exposed a weakness</strong> with particles that I didn’t know I had.  Doing normal sentence cards, I had been glossing over them and guessing the meaning, but with MCDs now I’m actually learning them. ナイス！” | SilverSpoon BigBoi Day 37 of 495 | AJATT SilverSpoon <a title="http://j.mp/wrk1Fr" href="http://j.mp/wrk1Fr">j.mp/wrk1Fr</a></li>
<li>ダンちゃん (Danchan): “OK, so I’ve given MCD’s a try, and I have to say I really like them. The way the greater context combines with the cloze deletions seems to be a great way for me to dramatically improve my output in a relatively short time (especially written, I think).”  | Massive-Context Cloze-Deletion Cards (MCDs) | AJATT Blog Posts | Forum | AJATT Plus http://j.mp/hkpQ34</li>
<li>Amelia F: “I like the idea of “closing in” on a point you want to learn.”  | How to Pwn Grammatically Complex European Languages Using MCDs | AJATT Plus <a title="http://j.mp/eSpznE" href="http://j.mp/eSpznE">j.mp/eSpznE</a></li>
<li><a title="黒澤譲" href="http://twitter.com/curryisyummy" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">黒</a><a title="黒澤譲" href="http://twitter.com/curryisyummy" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">澤</a><a title="黒澤譲" href="http://twitter.com/curryisyummy" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">譲</a>/<a title="黒澤譲" href="http://twitter.com/curryisyummy" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">David/CurryIsYummy</a>: “<strong>I can see [MCDs] ending people’s problems</strong> with all kinds of prepositions/post-positions in all languages. When you think about it, that’s exactly what people who are even really good at languages, have the most trouble with. Most of my Japanese friends, they can use the right words almost all the time, but seem to always mess up things like “for”, “to”, “from”, “of”, “the”, “a”, etc. In Japanese we can, quite easily be rid of the issue of when to use は and が.” [Emphasis added] | How to Pwn Grammatically Complex European Languages Using MCDs | AJATT Plus <a title="http://j.mp/eSpznE" href="http://j.mp/eSpznE">j.mp/eSpznE</a></li>
<li>nacest: “For some reason[,] I never tried using cloze deletion[s] before I started testing…MCDs. Now I’m all over it. Thanks, Khatz <img alt=":)" src="http://lib.ajatt.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" /> ” | Aren’t cloze deletions great? | SRS | Forum | AJATT Plus <a title="http://j.mp/s3OVYw" href="http://j.mp/s3OVYw">j.mp/s3OVYw</a></li>
<li>Dani: “Takes better advantage of SRS by only testing me on one thing at a time.” | Dani’s Japanese Resources <a title="http://j.mp/yQPZw3" href="http://j.mp/yQPZw3">j.mp/yQPZw3</a></li>
<li>Dani: “The ability to add sentences based purely on interest rather than having to turn away otherwise good sources because they are “too difficult” | Dani’s Japanese Resources http://j.mp/yQPZw3</li>
<li>安藤 (Ando): &#8220;I’m knowing which particles to use without even knowing why and it’s <em>freaking me out</em>.”  | Massive-Context Cloze-Deletion Cards (MCDs) | AJATT Blog Posts | Forum | AJATT Plus http://j.mp/hkpQ34</li>
</ul>
<h1>Waitaminute! You Dirty, Brown, Effing Capitalist One Percenter Weasel! Isn&#8217;t This Just A SuperMemo Thing? Isn&#8217;t This Just Fill-In-The-Blanks?</h1>
<p>Actually, no. While the idea was inspired in part by SM (<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">SuperMemo &#8212; overlapping cloze deletions</a>) <a class="simple-footnote" title="(as well as learning examples found in Daniel Coyle&#8217;s Talent Code, ISHII Takashi&#8217;s One-Minute Learning Method and even the wooden dummies used for Wing Chun training as depicted in Donnie Yen&#8217;s Ip Man)" id="return-note-6605-3" href="#note-6605-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, MCDs differ in significant ways from any other example of cloze deletions I have ever seen, be it by Dr. Wozniak (SM), Coyle, <a href="http://amazon.jp/dp/4806140031/?tag=ajatt-20">Ishii</a> or even WikiPedia&#8217;s discussion of cloze deletions and their history. <strong>Every other example of cloze deletions I have seen, online or off, would make for a bad MCD</strong>, SRS boredom and significantly impaired &#8220;learning outcomes&#8221; (OMG, I love talking educationese; it&#8217;s like wiping your derrière with silk; I mean, I&#8217;ve never actually wiped my derrière with silk, but I can only imagine&#8230;mmmm).</p>
<p>In short, <strong>MCDs are a game-changer; MCDs are an evolution</strong>. They didn&#8217;t spring from nowhere, and they share &#8220;DNA&#8221; with other methods just like humans share DNA with chimpanzees. But ultimately, <strong>MCDs are fundamentally, qualitatively, quantitatively different from everything that has preceded them</strong>. That&#8217;s kinda why they have their own name. And kinda why they were incubated for so long. And kinda why a relatively big deal is being made about them. Because they are a big, new deal.</p>
