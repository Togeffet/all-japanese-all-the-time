<li>&#8220;The parts of the game [situations] where you worry the most are actually the most fun and interesting parts&#8221;.</li>
<li>最も＝もっとも</li>
<li>悩む＝なやむ</li>
<li>局面＝きょくめん <a class="simple-footnote" title="It&#8217;s interesting to note that the words 大局観 &#8212; which is in the title of the book (大局観（たいきょくかん）) &#8212; and 局面 (きょくめん) are related in terms of sharing the 局（きょく） character. A &#8220;局&#8221; can mean a single game of shogi. A 局面 is a situation (both in shogi and more generally). The 局面 is a dynamic, small-to-mid-size picture where the 大局 is the big, overall picture.

<li>面白い＝おもしろい</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;The parts of the game where you worry the most are actually the most fun and interesting parts&#8221;. Now, on the face of it, this sounds very un-AJATTy, being as it is that our Prime Directive here is to &#8220;have fun&#8221;. It sounds like masochism, and not just the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone/">all-for-show, binge-in-private, wishy-washy, pseudo-Darwinian, Anglo-Saxon kind (ASM)</a>, but some of that hardcore, under-the-table, suffer-in-silence Yamato Japanese stuff <a class="simple-footnote" title="(Japanese masochism, in its societal ubiquity and personal intensity, is literally off the chain [most stereotypes about Japan are false, but the ones about (over)work are more than 100% true &#8212; far from being exaggerations, they even understate the severity of the problem], but that&#8217;s a story for another day)" id="return-note-31026-3" href="#note-31026-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>Wroang!</p>
<p>Yoshi Habs&#8217; insight, the way I read it, that is, the way it hit me, actually relates to intermediate angst. And it&#8217;s basically saying this: the fact that you still have a lot of phrases to learn in order to reach the stage of &#8220;not sucking&#8221; <a class="simple-footnote" title="(because, remember, we never stop learning, but we do stop sucking &#8212; improvement is an infinite process made up of finite parts (winnable games), but suckage, non-suckage and even excellence are all finite)" id="return-note-31026-4" href="#note-31026-4"><sup>4</sup></a> means that you need never be bored.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-eternal-sorrow-of-the-intermediate-learner-%E2%80%9Care-we-there-yet%E2%80%9D-syndrome/">Being an intermediate learner,</a> therefore, should not be a source of consternation, but rather one of relief. The <strong>relief of ALWAYS HAVING SOMETHING TO DO</strong>. You always have a newspaper headline you could be MCDing. You always have a YouTube video you could be watching. You always have a word you could be looking up &#8212; and it doesn&#8217;t matter what word it is; you can pick any one.</p>
<p>Retired people <em>wish</em> they had your problems. People at the top of their game <a class="simple-footnote" title="(if they have a good memory of their origins in suckage)" id="return-note-31026-5" href="#note-31026-5"><sup>5</sup></a> <i>miss</i> having your problems; they don&#8217;t miss sucking, but they do miss the purity, simplicity and clarity of purpose that you now enjoy (assuming, of course, that you are currently at some intermediate level). Because not only do you have a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/identity-and-self-fulfilling-prophecy/">direction</a>, a purpose, but you also have degrees of freedom. If you&#8217;re learning Japanese, virtually any and every direction you pick that contains Japanese <a class="simple-footnote" title="except for romaji, because f### romaji lol" id="return-note-31026-6" href="#note-31026-6"><sup>6</sup></a> is good, will send you up, will help you improve. Seriously. Anything.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why enjoyment matters, because enjoyment leads to repetition. Repetition leads to continuation (habit). And <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-can-a-lawyer-teach-you-about-learning-japanese/">continuation leads to unlimited power (muahahahaaa) #ItouMakoto</a>. It&#8217;s a pretty sweet deal. Yoga said all these things in the prequel, but they got edited out so there&#8217;d be more Jar-Jar scenes #choices.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now. More later!</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05em;">Is Yoshihabs preaching fatalism here? Is that what it&#8217;s come to? No. Not at all. He&#8217;s talking about <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/timeboxing-trilogy-part-1-what-and-why/">timeboxing</a>. Sometimes, you think and think and think and think and <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-problem-is-choice/">still can&#8217;t come to a decision</a>. So what do you do? Well, if you&#8217;re smart and sensitive person, you curl up into a ball and fester in a state of permanent indecision that morphs into a multi-year bout of clinical depression. But if you&#8217;re even smarter and wiser than that, you <strong>cut your losses and make a decision anyhow</strong>. The GOAT of shogi does not waste his time overthinking. Which is not to say that he doesn&#8217;t think at all. He just doesn&#8217;t get lost in a thought <a href="http://amzn.to/2eJCpom">quagmire</a>. He doesn&#8217;t get embroiled in mental <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/ベトナム戦争">Vietnam</a>/<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/アフガニスタン紛争_(1978年-1989年)">Afghanistan</a>. He gets the heck out and moves the heck on.</span></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t overthink. Set a cut-off point. Let life go on (it will anyway, but you need to let it go on for yourself as well, innit). <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games/">Make the game winnable</a>, that is, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done/"><strong><em>make it finite</em></strong><em>; give it many</em> internal end-points</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="again, timeboxing is a great way to do this" id="return-note-30988-1" href="#note-30988-1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done/">and &#8220;save-points&#8221;.

<p>Go back up through the series if you need a refresher on what we&#8217;re even talking about. Cool? Cool.</p>
<p>Right. Brass tacks time!</p>

<li>将棋であれ、スポーツであれ、ビジネスであれ、「勝負にはミスが付き物」と言っていいと思う。勿論、誰だってミスをする積もりなど微塵も無いけれど、パーフェクトなパフォーマンスを実現するのは至難の業だ。《中略》「今日の将棋は完璧だった、ミスも無く、百点満点のパーフォーマンスだった」と思える事は、私には殆ど無い。一、二年に一度、あるかどうかだ。</li>
<li>Whether in shogi, sports, or business, I think that making mistakes is a normal part of any game. Of course, nobody deliberately intends to make mistakes, but perfect performance is virtually impossible&#8230;It virtually never happens that I can think &#8220;I played a 100% perfect game of shogi today and made zero mistakes&#8221;, except for maybe once every couple of years, if that.</li>
<li>将棋＝しょうぎ</li>
<li>勿論＝もちろん</li>

</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing for your mate, Todd, the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/potheads-planners-and-players/">pothead</a> with a <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;hl=ja">hoarding</a> problem and <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-are-you-acting-like-a-deadbeat-dad-language-learner/">illegitimate children he never sees</a> (lol) to tell you to chill and that &#8220;making mistakes is&#8230;normal&#8221;; it&#8217;s another thing altogether for the greatest shogi player of all time to say it. <a class="simple-footnote" title="I assign different weights to the opinions of different people and so should you! lol" id="return-note-30951-1" href="#note-30951-1"><sup>1</sup></a> You&#8217;d think that a 9&#215;9 board would be small enough of a world that you could reliably experience <em>some</em> perfection, but it isn&#8217;t and you don&#8217;t &#8212; not even if you&#8217;re the GOAT. Not even if you&#8217;re the Japanese GOAT of a Japanese game. No perfection soup for you!</p>
<p>You <a href="http://amzn.to/2uNxZTY">cannot dependably produce perfection, but you <em>can</em> dependably produce improvement</a>. And I only keep telling you this because I need to hear it myself; it&#8217;s a lesson I keep &#8220;teaching&#8221; because it&#8217;s a lesson I need to keep learning. If <a href="http://amzn.to/2uNthp6">perfectionism is a disease</a>, then&#8230;you know, I mean, first of all, ewww gross (lol). Secondly, it needs to be handled with ruthless efficiency &#8212; failing to prevent it or leaving it untreated is even grosser than having it, just like failing to clean dirty toilets is even grosser than having them dirty. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Dood, how ironic would it be to be a perfectionist about preventing perfectionism? Stranger things have happened&#8230;" id="return-note-30951-2" href="#note-30951-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<p>Aaaand, that&#8217;s all for now. I was gonna go longer, but I figure it&#8217;s better to keep these parts short and frequent, rather than force you to wait indeterminate amounts of time for one big, long, dump <a class="simple-footnote" title="There&#8217;s a vegan/paleo diet joke in here somewhere but I can&#8217;t be bothered to go fish it out." id="return-note-30951-3" href="#note-30951-3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The only way to guarantee not losing at a game is to not play it in the first place <a class="simple-footnote" title="There are games that can only be won by not playing them, but that&#8217;s not quite what we&#8217;re talking about here." id="return-note-30967-1" href="#note-30967-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. But then, of course, you lose something else. The joy of playing. The camaraderie. Any and all chances of winning&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, it probably isn&#8217;t apparent right here and now, because this quote has been liberated from its original context <a class="simple-footnote" title="For more context, get the book itself; you know I&#8217;m not going to type it all out for you :P" id="return-note-30967-2" href="#note-30967-2"><sup>2</sup></a> but what it&#8217;s saying is this: <strong>shogi&#8217;s GOAT has freed himself from the need to not lose. He is free of desperation. He has accepted that loss is a part of the equation also.</strong> But this has not stopped him from being the GOAT. In fact, the relaxation, the calmness and sense of ease that this state of mind produces may, paradoxically, have helped him become the GOAT. It&#8217;s like a Greek tragedy in reverse:<strong> the things you do instead of caring about winning actually make you a winner</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>This idea reminds me of <a href="http://amzn.to/2eGj9YV">the book <em>Organize Tomorrow Today</em></a><em> (OTT)</em>, which, despite its title, literally is not a book about personal organization or time management. You know how some books have awesome titles but then are just kind of &#8220;meh&#8221; inside? This book is the polar opposite of that. In many ways, relative to its quality, it&#8217;s possibly the worst-titled book in the history of human writing. And yet, I cannot myself think of a title that would do it justice <a class="simple-footnote" title="Keiko once joked that I was terrible at titles, and she might be right :P" id="return-note-30967-3" href="#note-30967-3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Anyway, in OTT, they talk about how both professional sportsmen (whom they&#8217;ve worked with as personal consultants) and professional regular adults (ditto), and even children, will do their best when they<strong> focus exclusively on the things they <em>can</em> control</strong>.</p>
<p>The irony is that<strong> ignoring the things we cannot control actually gives us more (not complete, but more) control over them than focussing on them does</strong>. And,<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/vocabulary-expansion-circle-of-concern-circle-of-control/"> if you&#8217;ve been paying attention more than I have (not a hard thing to do, BTW), then you&#8217;ll have realized that this is exactly what the late Stephen Covey was talking about it in <em>7 Habits</em> with his concentric Circles of, respectively, Control (green), Influence (yellow) and Concern (red))</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t run red lights. Or even yellow ones. It&#8217;s not impressive and it doesn&#8217;t make you a baller. At best, it merely puts you at risk of great suffering. Focus on your circle of control.</p>
<p>You know, I used to think all them Greek tragedies were stupid and negative and fatalistic and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHqgHFcmAOc">ignan&#8217;t</a> &#8212; and maybe they are &#8212; but maybe they were actually trying to teach us something, and I&#8217;m only just now finally waking up to the lesson. After all, it&#8217;s not just in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_Rex">Sophocles screenplay</a><i> </i>that the things you do to prevent bad thing X happening (e.g. <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/オイディプス王">your son murdering you and screwing your wife, who is also his Mom, because she&#8217;s literally a MILF</a>) actually produce bad thing X: in water, being and acting afraid produces the very results that people who haven&#8217;t yet learned how to handle themselves in water are afraid of. Perhaps Sophocles and his colleagues in the Ancient Greek entertainment industry wanted us to learn about self-fulfilling prophecies and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Self-Efficacy-Exercise-Control-Albert-Bandura/dp/0716728508/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500843559&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=self-efficacy">self-efficacy</a> and directing our mental focus in productive directions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games/">Games involve winning and losing</a>. If you don&#8217;t want to lose, don&#8217;t play. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/competition-is-for-the-weak-and-lazy/">If you want to win, play against yourself</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chronic+future+come+correct">Come correct</a>. Come prepared to <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/aim-to-fail/">lose and improve</a>: paradoxically, this will make you a winner. Take that home and smoke it. It&#8217;s good for shogi, it&#8217;s good for SRSing, and it&#8217;s good for life in general.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part  of 10 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-shogi-japanese-chess-can-teach-you-about-languages-learning-and-life/" class="series-777" title="What Shogi [Japanese Chess] Can Teach You About Languages, Learning and Life">What Shogi [Japanese Chess] Can Teach You About Languages, Learning and Life</a></div><p>So, it occurred to me that this series was never going to get started until it got started, so here we go. You&#8217;re never going to be 100% ready, but don&#8217;t let that be an excuse to take 0% action, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Um, right out the gate, let&#8217;s do a bit of a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludic_fallacy"> &#8220;Talebian disclaimer&#8221; with regard to what Nassim (Taleb) would call the &#8220;Ludic Fallacy&#8221; &#8212; using games, which are simple and calculable, to model reality, which is too complex to calculate</a>. Chess is a turn-based game with unambiguous rules played on a board of limited scope. To be fair, it&#8217;s deep as all get-out, and the possibilities are too complex and numerous for even the best supercomputer to crunch out; this isn&#8217;t tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) &#8212; artificial intelligences, just like organic intelligences, have to<strong> give up on optimizing (finding the absolute best/perfect solution) and be content with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing"><em>satisficing </em></a>(using the best solution that can be found within the constraints of the available time and resources, and not bothering with perfection)</strong>. That is, they have to make a best guess based on limited, incomplete information. They have to, as it were, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-best-bad-idea/">pick the best bad idea</a>; there is simply no time to calculate every possibility. But chess, deep as it is, is not even a puddle compared to real life.</p>
<p>Real life is not equivalent to chess; casinos are not equivalent to stock markets; casinos (Mediocristan) aren&#8217;t even <em>like</em> stock markets (Extremistan). Real life is full of power-law distributions. Only our artificially simple games are Gaussian. But <strong>does that mean that we can&#8217;t learn any lessons from chess</strong>? Hail naw. I mean, of course not. Sorry, too much rap music. There&#8217;s probably enough depth in chess to keep us busy finding real-life applications for years, perhaps even a lifetime. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s never, ever going to be a 1-to-1 correspondence.</p>
<p>That was a lukewarm-a$$ disclaimer, wasn&#8217;t it? Barely seems worth having made. Oh well, it&#8217;s written now. Let&#8217;s move on!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part  of 10 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-shogi-japanese-chess-can-teach-you-about-languages-learning-and-life/" class="series-777" title="What Shogi [Japanese Chess] Can Teach You About Languages, Learning and Life">What Shogi [Japanese Chess] Can Teach You About Languages, Learning and Life</a></div><p>Way back in 2005, computer scientist Jeff Hawkins produced&#8230;I&#8217;m not so hot with the adjectives but I&#8217;m just going to call it <a href="http://amzn.to/2rGMMLj">an unbelievably awesome book called &#8220;On Intelligence&#8221;</a>. Although I only discovered it many years after it was published, it was and is way ahead of its time, and most researchers &#8212; including <a href="http://amzn.to/2uTWz5u">the great Ray Kurzweil, who&#8217;s usually the one out in front leading the pack &#8212; are only just beginning to catch up to its ideas</a>. It really deserves its own course to plumb its depths with you. But today, we&#8217;re just going to cover the big ideas.</p>
<p>So, like, remember how earlier we talked about how <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-a-martial-art/">language is a martial art</a> (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-friendship-and-familiarity/">among</a> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-peeing/">other</a> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies/">metaphors</a>)? And how <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/thinking-aloud-shogi-is-essentially-a-language/">chess is a language</a> because the neurocognitive architecture &#8212; the organic hardware and software &#8212; that creates and manipulates them is the same?</p>
<p>Well, this book is the source, spring and well-argued proof (? &#8212; not sure if that&#8217;s the right word&#8230;not too hot with the nouns either, innit) of that idea.</p>
<p>Jeff Hawkins wants to explain what &#8220;intelligence&#8221; actually is so we can use it to create more powerful artificial intelligences. As it turns out, his insights help us learn how to use our natural, organic intelligence as well.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the basic idea.</p>
<ol>
<li>All memories are just (stimulus) patterns in the neocortex</li>
<li>All skill is memory boosted by <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/book-review-the-talent-code-greatness-isnt-born-its-grown-heres-how/">automaticity and myelination</a>. That&#8217;s why:</li>
<li>Learning one skill unlocks the &#8220;secret&#8221; to learning other skills</li>
</ol>
<p>Or, to paraphrase <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/brain-rules/">John Medina of &#8220;Brain Rules&#8221;: if you want to become skilled, memorize. If you want to memorize, repeat.</a></p>
<p>If what I&#8217;ve just told you doesn&#8217;t sound amazing, that&#8217;s my fault, not Jeff&#8217;s. The scales will fall from your eyes when you get into his explanation of how everything is just a pattern. He also talks a lot about how memory/intelligence isn&#8217;t for &#8220;thinking&#8221; as much as it is for making predictions. Again, when we finally unpack this, it&#8217;ll blow your mind. I hate how I seem to make wonderful books sound bland lol.</p>

<p>Experienced chess players (of all variants) can easily recall, produce and communicate in &#8220;words&#8221; and &#8220;phrases&#8221; &#8212; chunks and patterns of legal moves and board positions.</p>
<p>But they can&#8217;t remember gibberish (i.e. random arrangements of pieces that could never constitute real/possible/legal gameplay) any better than chess noobs.</p>
<p>So it could be that because the same human hardware &#8212; &#8220;neurocognitive architecture&#8221; &#8212; implements (creates and uses) both languages and shogi, the similarity is more a case of myelin-sheathing hammers making everything look like nails, rather than everything actually being nails.</p>
<p>Shades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Intelligence">Jeff Hawkins&#8217; &#8220;memory-prediction framework theory of the brain&#8221;</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, check out <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/book-review-the-talent-code-greatness-isnt-born-its-grown-heres-how/">Dan Coyle&#8217;s &#8220;The Talent Code&#8221; for more on myelination</a>.</p>

<p>The English titles I&#8217;m giving them leave something to be desired in terms of coolness, but they at least largely accurate in terms of communicating the lexical (?) meaning of the original, if not the emotional feeling. A good compromise leaves *everyone* unhappy, right? (lol)</p>
<p>Did I mention that HABU Yoshiharu is amazing? Coz he is. He writes nice, short books, with the economy and insight of a man who has something to say instead of a man who has pages to fill. Mad respect. Anyway, yeah, more later!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part  of 10 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-shogi-japanese-chess-can-teach-you-about-languages-learning-and-life/" class="series-777" title="What Shogi [Japanese Chess] Can Teach You About Languages, Learning and Life">What Shogi [Japanese Chess] Can Teach You About Languages, Learning and Life</a></div><p>So, as you probably already know, all chess originated in, like, India. The Persian variant became Western (international) chess. There&#8217;s a bunch of regional variants; there&#8217;s a Chinese variant, an Ethiopian variant, as well as a Japanese variant. And that&#8217;s what shogi (将棋 (しょうぎ）) is &#8212; Japanese chess.</p>
<p>Shogi is all sorts of cool. For one thing, you can capture your opponent&#8217;s pieces and turn them against him &#8212; kind of like how 30,000 of 40,000 Indian POWs in Burma during <a href="http://squid314.livejournal.com/275614.html">a couple of the seasons</a> of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1507526">that rather unfortunate global reality show in the 1940s</a> volunteered to fight for Japan.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t actually even like board games, and I especially don&#8217;t like chess of any kind&#8211; although I do love hanging out with my friends while we play board games and I do have a soft spot for Othello/Reversi, but &#8212; chess, as a game, to be played, has always bored me.</p>
<p>But then there&#8217;s this guy. His name is <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%BD%E7%94%9F%E5%96%84%E6%B2%BB">HABU Yoshiharu</a>. And he makes me love shogi. Not love it enough to play it (lol), but still. I&#8217;m in love. I leave the <a href="http://www.igoshogi.net/">go/shogi channel on in the background all day (yes, it&#8217;s a real cable channel; yes, it runs 24/7</a>)</p>
<p>So who is <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%BD%E7%94%9F%E5%96%84%E6%B2%BB">Yoshi Habs</a>? Well, he&#8217;s the best living (human? organic?) player of the game, and currently perhaps the GOAT. AFAIK, shogi AI hasn&#8217;t quite yet pwned all the best humans, although it no doubt soon will. Anyway, HABU&#8217;s been playing the game a long time, since he was a kid, although he started quite late, wasn&#8217;t a prodigy at all, and actually sucked hard early on.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s written many articles and at dozens of books &#8212; all of which appear to only be available in Japanese (certainly not in English) &#8212; on the game and the profound life lessons it contains. There&#8217;s depth and insight in there that you can apply to specifically to learning languages and more generally to learning about life and how to be awesome(r) and stuff.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;d like to make you a course about his ideas, his insights and how they can help you. Maybe I&#8217;ll need to break it down and take it one book at a time. But, yeah, that&#8217;s the plan. Stay tuned!</p>
