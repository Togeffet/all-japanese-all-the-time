I&#039;d totally donate...if I had a job :(

Anyways, I just wanted to say thanks, you&#039;re the best! AJATT has completely turned around my Japanese study method. I&#039;m not so worried anymore about my SRS reps and struggling to memorize them. I just know that growth is an inevitable result of one&#039;s quest for joy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Depends on your area, but you may be able to find some local stuff... do some google searching for &quot;Japanese book store&quot; or &quot;Japanese food store&quot; or similar things. 

In San Diego and Los Angeles they have Book off which is simply amazing, you can buy all sorts of used books for 1$ each, and they also have a good selection of Japanese programs and American series dubbed in Japanese. 

Also, in Virginia where I am now, I&#039;ve found a couple of small family owned shop type places that stock a limited supply of videos.... one of which is just strait recorded from the TV so it includes all of the commercials. 

Other than that, there are a few online services that offer Japanese TV (most for free) try keyhole TV... there are few others but I don&#039;t remember them off had. 

itunes also has several video blogs which are quite interesting.

And then of course there are bit torrents if all else fails.]]></description>

I do have a bit of a request, could you possibly add a link to a store that would sell Japanese TV (with commercials and all), I&#039;ve torn apart the internet and have yet to find this, and Japanese TV is of course not available where I live?

Thanks!]]></description>
