					<description><![CDATA[I agree with this.  I did have to look at where to go, but I had little trouble after that.  Nowadays, while I cannot understand the text that NPCs say, I understand a great deal of the menus in キングスフィールド(I love this game I play it lot in Japanese).  Furthermore, the game uses pictures for the weapons/armor/other items, making it much easier as well.  

Also, if you asked me about what a Japanese stream would be doing in Dark Souls at the time, I could tell you, as I&#039;ve played it in English, alot.  Which is odd, considering that I played past New game only once or twice and wasn&#039;t any good at PvP to begin with.  I wonder how much of Dark Souls II I&#039;ll understand from my knowledge of the first game.

Lastly, I&#039;m starting to be able to take hints from the Kanji.  I know this because a certain NPC had a Moon Gate I wanted, but wouldn&#039;t give it to me.  I keep talking to him and he simply repeated his last line repeatedly.  That&#039;s when my grinding paid off.  When I saw シース and 持 in the same sentence, I figured that he wanted a Statue of Seath and knew exactly where that was.  I came back and he gave me the 月のゲート when I gave him said item.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Turn the hourglass, preacher!  It&#039;s all about the tiny building blocks!  All you need then is lots of context-rich source material... like TV shows or manga to be able to understand how they fit together.  (I... wasted a lot of time with dictionary sentences which I had no hope of understanding without a picture.  Don&#039;t make my mistake :P)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the point about seeking out media you can enjoy without understanding it.  I made the decision to switch to raw Japanese because the way I see it, if something can&#039;t hold my interest because it&#039;s too hard to understand, I should skip it, even if I think, &quot;I&#039;d love this if only I could read it!&quot;  I can always go back and check it out again later. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s going to disappear from the world. 

And even if I can&#039;t follow every part of every conversation, that&#039;s no big deal.  I watch shows in English, forget most of what was said on them anyway, and never worry about it.]]></description>
