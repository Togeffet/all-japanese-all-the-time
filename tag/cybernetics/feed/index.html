								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was just thinking today about how &#8220;dirty&#8221; and fluid and lazy <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/lazy-kanji-cards-a-new-srs-card-format">Lazy Kanji</a> is. And I was thinking about the obnoxious certainty that anti-<a href="http://amzn.to/aAYyP9">RTK</a> people have about how RTK couldn&#8217;t possibly work.</p>
<p>And it hit me that it may have been <a href="http://www.pangaro.com/published/cyber-macmillan.html">this article (about the differences and similarities between AI and cybernetics)</a> by a guy calledÂ <a href="http://www.pangaro.com/">Paul Pangaro</a> that got me thinking in the direction of lazy kanji. For curiosity&#8217;s sake, here are a couple of interesting quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;information (or intelligence for that matter) is an attribute of an <strong>interaction</strong> rather than a commodity stored in a computer&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This quote in particular (from Humberto Maturana&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.enolagaia.com/M70-80BoC.html">Biology of Cognition</a></em> and <em><a href="http://amzn.to/apdmTU">Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living</a></em>) really got me thinking [emphasis added]:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Learning is not a process of accumulation of representations of the environment; it is a <strong><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/processes-not-results-or-everything-i-ever-needed-to-know-about-life-i-learned-washing-dishes">continuous process</a></strong> of transformation of <strong>behavior</strong> through continuous change in the capacity of the nervous system to synthesize it. <strong>Recall does not depend on the indefinite retention of a structural invariant</strong> that represents an entity (an idea, image or symbol), but on the<strong> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-dont-have-a-foreign-language-problem-you-have-an-adult-literacy-problem">functional ability</a></strong> of the system to create, when certain recurrent demands are given, a behavior that satisfies the recurrent demands or that the observer would class as a reenacting of a previous one.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What does it mean to &#8220;know&#8221; a language? What does it mean to &#8220;know&#8221; a kanji?</strong> It&#8217;s a question of worldview, I guess. To put it a little simplistically, it&#8217;s a question of whether one sees things statically or dynamically. And it&#8217;s important that each of us gets somewhat clear on an answer to these questions, because that <strong>answer will decide whether life is tingly and fun, or toadly sucky. </strong></p>
<p>If one defaults to one of the certification-seller-approved answers and decides that: &#8220;knowing&#8221; a language means being able to take boring, arbitrary, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/git-up-git-up-git-down-jlpt-is-the-joke-in-yo-town-why-i-hate-the-jlpt-and-why-its-a-waste-of-your-time-and-money">authority-presuming tests</a> on it, administered by people you neither know nor like, then that&#8217;s fine, too &#8212; it&#8217;ll just&#8230;suck.</p>
<p>If one defaults to one of the school-approved answers and decides that:Â &#8220;knowing&#8221; a language means doing <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/classes-suck">insomnia-curing textbook assignments</a> on it and avoiding FUNBUN (for-native by-native media) like the plague (or rationing out FUNBUN as a &#8220;reward&#8221; for &#8220;real learning&#8221;, as if FUNBUN were some kind of fattening dessert instead of the nutritious vegetable dish that it is), then that, too, is fine&#8230;it just kind of sucks.</p>
<p>Translated specifically into language-acquisition terms, Maturana seems to me to be saying: you don&#8217;t get good at a language, you get used to it &#8212; it&#8217;s a<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/little-and-often"> habit</a>; it&#8217;s aÂ <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-friendship-and-familiarity">relationship</a>. It&#8217;s as if the language were a person. You don&#8217;t learn to &#8220;read&#8221;, youÂ <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-dont-have-a-foreign-language-problem-you-have-an-adult-literacy-problem">get used to text</a>; you develop text <strong>reflex</strong>es.Â Not only is the language itself in flux, but we are in flux with respect to the language.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, James Heisig freed us from stifling and ineffective ideas of what it means to know a kanji. To the extent that unquestioned, unfettered attachment to the RTK method threatens to itself become a new orthodoxy, the Lazy Kanji/SRS combination could be a new &#8220;mini-shift&#8221; in kanji perception: <strong>you don&#8217;t &#8220;know&#8221; kanji, you get used to them &#8212; just like your phone number</strong>. (So used to them, in fact, thatÂ you can read and write them in any situation you want or need to).</p>
<p>Having said that, Lazy Kanji is actually built on the core RTK insights, namely that:</p>
<ol>
<li>the component logic of kanji should be exploited to learn each characterÂ <strong>bottom-up</strong>, and each &#8220;family&#8221; of characters in order of increasing structural complexity.</li>
<li>each kanji represents a concept that transcends any one language, and this concept can be represented using a word or words in yourÂ <strong>native language</strong> or L1.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, to me, it just represents a natural progression rather than a &#8220;revolution&#8221; or anything drastic like that. Heisig&#8217;s always going to be top dog in my book. He brought us so far. He broke the mold.</p>
<p>In any case, I think the ultimate lesson is this: <strong>screw doing things &#8220;the&#8221; right way. Your way doesn&#8217;t have to be &#8220;right&#8221; &#8212; it just has to work</strong>. Maybe we&#8217;ll add that to the &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-three-laws-of-language-learning-version-1-0">Three Laws of Language Acquisition</a>&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
