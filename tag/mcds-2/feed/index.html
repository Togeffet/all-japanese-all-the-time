								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ultimately, Japanese is an easy language to learn because it has such a well-developed learning support infrastructure &#8212; for regular as well as remedial users <a class="simple-footnote" title="This is AJATTspeak&#8230;verbal acrobatics intended to be helpful. Regular=normal/native. Remedial=L2/JSL=you" id="return-note-6728-1" href="#note-6728-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The trick is tapping into the infrastructure.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what SRS has always been about &#8212; for me, at least: how to exploit &#8212; leverage &#8212; the existing infrastructure, how to co-opt it for our use and benefit.</p>
<p>Not every language has a good infrastructure, even languages with massive user populations and healthy media output. Good luck finding Hindi or Cantonese dictionaries <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>Having said that, all hope is not lost, even with languages that have less robust infrastructure; with some investment of time and resources, and tweaking of methods, you can create yourself a local infrastructure (=environment) that does the job of creating an &#8220;engineered inevitability&#8221; situation where you&#8217;re getting used to the language in a manageable, repeatable, inexorable way (cf: MCDs). So a system, basically. But one that&#8217;s actually good. One that actually works.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the language, it&#8217;s the infrastructure and how you orient yourself to it.</p>
<p>Anyway, just random thoughts&#8230;about your Mom&#8230;</p>
