You can just live. Your environment will essentially make your choices for you.</p>
<p>I never needed to &#8220;manage time&#8221; and I never needed to &#8220;<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/automated-discipline-how-to-keep-new-years-resolutions-and-stay-on-track-all-the-time">discipline</a>&#8221; myself. People who have dealt with me know how I am; I am intensely undisciplined: I sit around unwashed; emails and phone calls to me go unanswered.</p>
<p>I knew all I needed to do was change my environment. And that&#8217;s all I really &#8220;tried&#8221; to do, that&#8217;s the only place I made an effort. I am encouraging you to try the same. Not because you &#8220;should&#8221;, but because it&#8217;s the easy way out.</p>
<p>Real men don&#8217;t take the easy way out. But I&#8217;m not a real man. I&#8217;m a pathetic wusspot who thinks sweats can count as formal wear if they&#8217;re new <a class="simple-footnote" title="So&#8230;a chav. Wait, no!" id="return-note-4807-1" href="#note-4807-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Take the easy way out. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don&#8217;t change yourself. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone">Change your environment</a>.</span></strong> Don&#8217;t choose Japanese. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-immersion-environment-rome-wasnt-built-in-a-daybut-this-isnt-rome-so-a-week-should-totally-do">Choose a Japanese environment</a>. Don&#8217;t do Japanese.

Clarke famously opined: &#8220;The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible&#8221;. What is actually possible is probably out in the area of what you currently mistakenly assume to be impossible. Don&#8217;t make disabling excuses. Make enabling excuses." id="return-note-4807-2" href="#note-4807-2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Don&#8217;t try to &#8220;win&#8221; at Japanese, just make it so that winning at Japanese is the only possible conclusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to read Japanese books. Just only have Japanese books in your house/room/car/bag.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t try to watch Japanese TV and movies. Just only have Japanese TV and movies. And then leave them playing.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t watch movies. Just leave movies playing with the sound on.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t surf more Japanese websites. Just have them always loading and loaded. Make <a href="http://kids.yahoo.co.jp/">Yahoo Kids</a> your homepage. Use the<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/url-shuffler"> Surusu URL Shuffler</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Easy, right? Like a speck of dust, it&#8217;s nothing, really. It is nothing. It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">無為</a>.

<p>You don&#8217;t learn the language you could, should or want to learn. You learn the language of your bedroom, your kitchen, your living room, your web browser history, and your iPod.</p>
