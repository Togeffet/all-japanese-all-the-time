					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] New Year‚Äôs resolutions are a tactic and a decidedly crappy one at that. You need better tactics, tactics that can be executed more frequently than once every 365.24219878 days (google it); that‚Äôs almost the definition of a craptastic tactic; WTF are you doing using a tool you can‚Äôt even control? Aren‚Äôt there already enough things you don‚Äôt control? You need to add one? Come on, man. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;nothing‚Äôs more painful than doggedly continuing to go for something you don‚Äôt even want any more just because it‚Äôs something you thought you wanted, that you thought mattered, back in the past&quot;
That it is, that it is. It&#039;s a very strange behavioural quirk that applies to most humans. Even after it has become obvious that something has served its purpose (or not), even though they know it to be counterproductive, they insist on being a slave to it because of some false sense of identity they&#039;ve set for themselves.
Well, either that or humans are just plain stupid. A baby chimp touches something and gets burned, it stays clear of it. A baby human never ceases to be stupid.
Which is why the only way to improve a human&#039;s behaviour is by improving its environment.
Thus, ask not what you can do for your environment, but what your environment can do for you. ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a nice wake-up call in a sense because I had daily &quot;goals&quot; like &quot;Read 30 minutes&quot; and so on. Slashed them from my notes and put &quot;Read 5 minutes of JoJo&quot; &quot;Read 5 minutes of Haruhi&quot; &quot;Play Persona 4 for 20 minutes&quot; and so on. Extremely specific goals are far less &quot;intimidating&quot; and a lot more interesting than the generic ones.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s weird coz I HATE this post and almost didn&#039;t put it up, but I guess you always did enjoy the nuts-and-bolts stuff, J-dawg...I shall keep that in mind. 

I hate giving detailed advice because too many people seem to try to follow it too closely and then end up hurting themselves. Or you get some people who analyze and argue it to death. Also, by the time I&#039;m done giving it, I&#039;ve usually obsoleted it already...I guess none of those are really bad things, though...every tool ever invented gets misused by some segment of the population...

Lol...I have eras now :)]]></description>
