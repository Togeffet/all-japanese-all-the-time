					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really surprised NO ONE caught the contradiction in the very beginning of this article.

You call the fable bollocks, then go on to reinforce the point of the fable.  &quot;Slow and steady wins the race.&quot; You literally say that &quot;hares self-flagellate to the point of burnout. Their very obsession with the “race” and “running” it better, faster and longer causes them to come to hate anything to do with “running”.&quot;  This is exactly the point of this Aesop&#039;s Fable.  Slow down, enjoy it, and don&#039;t kill yourself in the process.

Other than calling a good fable &quot;bollocks,&quot; this is a great read!  Kudos.]]></description>

I never want to set date of when i want to get something done especially something like memorizing +3,000 kanji. Because i might rush threw it at the end and will not remember the one i rushed through.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very good point! I&#039;ve also found that taking on too much can lead to not doing anything. However, my personality is such that I do need to set some kind of goal, challenge myself in some way, because otherwise I&#039;m also not doing anything. Studying characters doesn&#039;t seem worthwhile if I can&#039;t say when I might know enough to use them.

I recently wrote a blog post about &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; in language-learning: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learnlangs.com/blog/2012/02/20/the-controversy-on-learning-fast-and-slowly/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.learnlangs.com/blog/2012/02/20/the-controversy-on-learning-fast-and-slowly/&lt;/a&gt; ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I first started to watch anime raw, I had this notion that I would be &quot;ruining&quot; a good plot line by not understanding most of it. But then I realized, what&#039;s more important: absorbing the message of this anime, or becoming fluent? I thought the answer was obvious. 

So relating back to your situation, what&#039;s more important to you? Getting all your kanji down for your internship, or getting the kanji down correctly so you can continue to build and gain fluency?

Also, I wouldn&#039;t worry about the differences in the 5th and 6th edition right now. If this issue is slowing you down to the extent where you actually aren&#039;t doing kanji, then just don&#039;t worry about the the extra kanji in the 6th edition. Just skip them for now, and just check them out at the end with the 5th edition&#039;s supplemental pdf (which is legit and free).

It doesn&#039;t matter how many kanji you do a day/how many sentences you&#039;re learning/how much vocab you&#039;re picking up, all that matters is that progress is being made. I know that sometimes it can feel like we&#039;re lowering our standards by just striving to make progress, but then again, if you are like me, who had month long gaps in the initial stages of RTK study, maybe it isn&#039;t a lower standard after all.
 
I hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That &quot;attempting to force 100 kanji a day&quot; thing is what really nailed it for me. My original plan was to finish RTK by the end of the year, and at my current amount of completion (~450 kanji), I&#039;d have to do 100 a day to get there. But lately I&#039;ve been looking at that amount in Anki and going &quot;Screw it, I&#039;m playing Minecraft.&quot; But at the same time, dropping it down to my if-I&#039;m-lucky rate of 25 kanji a day means I won&#039;t finish in time for what I need to do (an internship at a local Japanese cultural center, but I&#039;ll probably be using English there anyway). I dunno, maybe 25 kanji twice a day, see what happens? Or just drop down to just 25 kanji once a day, since my retention level is bombing right now...
Probably the other thing that&#039;s slowing me down is the prep work I have to do, since the deck I&#039;m using 1) removed about 150 rarely-used kanji (it&#039;s the Japanese Level Up deck), and 2) is configured for 5th edition while my copy of RTK is 6th edition, so I have to figure out which ones in the book are actually in the deck before I can do them...]]></description>

I just pick up the neasrest piece of rubbish and put it where it belongs, picking up other stuff (or not) when I pass it. There&#039;s no system, but the room&#039;s clean before you know it :-)

I know exactly what you mean. After studying Kanji everyday for a couple months it just becomes part of you and something you do without stress. It&#039;s a lifestyle change and if you&#039;re willing to make it, the language is yours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been following your blog for quite some time, and I figured out that when I am a hare, I never remember any kanji at all. However, when I do the tortoise, It dawned to me that I nearly recognized all the JLPT N5 Kanji (yeah, I&#039;m still there). Thanks for the awesome post. It was really inspirational ( and the first on that got me to comment on it!). I feel like I just want to jump in doing everything in Japanese without that slow and steady transition!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got a fortune from a fortune cookie the other day that reminded me of this post. 

&quot;Winners forget they&#039;re in a race, they just love to run.&quot; 

Ultimately, if you make the experience as enjoyable as possible and keep from focusing on getting it over with, you&#039;ll be better off in the long run. The thing is just to get lost in the language, to enjoy running for running&#039;s sake. Everything else will take care of itself eventually.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess after reading all your posts I&#039;m really a tortoise o.o

I usually don&#039;t even get through even ten kanji a day even though I spend maybe three or four hours per day at minimum immersed in Japanese (and enjoying it). So after about a year and a half I know around 700 kanji, which seems like not much at all after reading what you guys say. Most of you are using Heisig right? I&#039;ve tried it a few times, but I find it ineffective for myself. I think that I&#039;d much rather learn word compounds then kanji strictly by themselves.  

I don&#039;t know so well, but for myself using an SRS and Heisig have bored me, so I just spend time now reading books and news articles, and looking up new words :P

Hopefully there isn&#039;t anything wrong with this (&#062;.&#060;)]]></description>
