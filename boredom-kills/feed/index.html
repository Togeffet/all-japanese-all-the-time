					<description><![CDATA[I say still learn kanji first. Just do it faster. Plow through them. Rush through them. Decide not to care much about them at all. Go 200-400 a day and shoot for a 5% retention rate. Use mere seconds on the card, just decide in your brain whether or not you can write them. If you can&#039;t on your first attempt, just push them off onto the next day and decide not to care. Brute force a few days and get the stupid thing done in a week. You&#039;ll have finished RTK, still have some idea of the Kanji and it&#039;ll all work out somehow.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the wrong attitude to take, I feel. You seem to assume that &quot;boredom&quot; is something you inherently feel for a certain activity/thing. This is not the case, however. It&#039;s a matter of perspective. I for one, for example, found Tae Kim, a grammar guide, to be ridiculously fun and interesting to do and I just plowed through it. It wasn&#039;t a thing I had to do. When given the choice between playing video games, reading manga, or doing Tae Kim, I decided to do Tae Kim to find out about all these awesome things the language can do.

At the same time, I totally was on Kaz&#039;s side when he said you don&#039;t need a formal grammar. I learned English without any kind of formal grammar. And no, it&#039;s not my native language. I just played video games and started reading and at some point I was just... well, there. I didn&#039;t even speak English, yet I can speak it quite well these days. I&#039;d consider myself to be at or above native level, even (Above native level meaning that I could probably write a novel in it if I set my mind to it. Well, I have written novels, but that was for NaNoWriMo, but I&#039;d say I probably know the language well enough to produce something publishable, though I&#039;d have to work at it more than I want to).

So I&#039;d say everyone should just keep doing the things they like. I&#039;ve found people who hug their copies of Minna No Nihongo. To me the book looks bulky and boring and I can&#039;t imagine taking a course for two years to get through that one stupid book, but there you go, different strokes for different folks, ain&#039;t it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also think fun doesn&#039;t come into this. Look at it this way:

You want to learn Japanese, so you decide to immerse yourself. Now you have these manga and that copy of Japanese Harry Potter in front of you. And you really want to read them. You&#039;re dying to read them. They&#039;re awesome, you love them!

But you need to know Kanji to read them. 

This doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t read them because it&#039;s too hard. This means you *need* those Kanji, right now, or your life will be ruined because you can&#039;t read those awesome things that are so fun that you&#039;re just about to explode. Learning the Kanji is such a tiny price to pay that the small effort required to do it is pretty much negligible. Just get it done and then be happy forever with your googly-eyed manga people and your Japanese-speaking wizard high school students (Sometimes I still think J.K. Rowling is actually Japanese just because of that setting, the book freakin belongs there!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m doubting whether RTK1 will actually have any benefits for me. I&#039;m about 300 Kanji in, and my motivation for RTK (but not Japanese) has almost completely faded. I&#039;m noticing that I almost always make stroke order errors when writing the Kanji, unless I rewrite it 2-6 times (I rarely get it right on the first try). I often skip letters and parts of letters when I write in my native English, I just go back and fill it in again later (I actually used to reverse letters and had quite a lot of trouble learning to write). I don&#039;t think my difficulties with writing English should be an excuse for not learning to write in Japanese properly, but I wonder if there might be a better approach. Perhaps I&#039;m doing something wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you find certain Kanji&#039;s boring, why not just suspend the Kanji. Then you can unsuspend when you feel that the Kanji&#039;s are no longer boring! I hope that helps.

Maybe try time boxing, where you do Kanji for like 3 minutes or however long you think you can take. Then take a break, which is up to you, maybe a 20min break, 1hr. The thing is, no need to rush, take it easy! Watch some japanese dramas, anime, read manga or just listen to music, podcasts^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I skipped the Kanji step and I couldn&#039;t be happier. You don&#039;t NEED to learn the Kanji first. And even though I didn&#039;t, my Lang-8 friends are amazed with the amount of Kanji I seem to know. All you have to do is put as much Kanji in the sentences you&#039;re learning as you can.

And then later, once you&#039;re fluent at other points of Japanese, you can always go back to the Kanji and Heisig if you feel you need to. Some people will say you then have &#039;bad habits&#039; or something, but I doubt it&#039;ll be that hard to fix. Just learn the basics of proper stroke order at the beginning of your Japanese adventure and it should be fine. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kanji first is basically so you can understand what the heck you&#039;re seeing and go monolingual (a lot) faster, I think.  jumping straight into sentences will quickly end up a heck of a burden compared to if you were going in already being familiar with the kanji and what they &#039;mean&#039;.

of course, people HAVE learned Japanese to fluency without ever touching RtK or an SRS... though to be fair, everyone I know personally who has done that is either native to the kanjisphere, or has sloppy kanji skills :)  still I&#039;m sure there are exceptions.

Just play with it...  if your immersion environment is tight and you&#039;re having fun in it, you&#039;re pretty much on a collision course with success, but in my experience kanji will take orders of magnitude longer to learn through absorption.  Learning them first means every time you see them afterwards will reinforce them, in some small way, in your memory.  Makes learning them in their thousands very feasible and a lot easier than most people will have you believe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[just a thought, have you guys that are finding getting through RtK1 (or just kanji in general) tried timeboxing?  I never had an issue with the kanji but thinking about it, I was timeboxing them all the time - basically I was SRSing them on surusu during my downtime at work.  Anything from 15 minute breaks, five seconds between calls (IT support, augh).  Once I was in uni and had a lot more free time (aha), I wasn&#039;t timeboxing at all, I was binging, and it was awful, and my kanji moved EXTREMELY slowly, for a year and a half.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>just a thought, have you guys that are finding getting through RtK1 (or just kanji in general) tried timeboxing?  I never had an issue with the kanji but thinking about it, I was timeboxing them all the time &#8211; basically I was SRSing them on surusu during my downtime at work.  Anything from 15 minute breaks, five seconds between calls (IT support, augh).  Once I was in uni and had a lot more free time (aha), I wasn&#8217;t timeboxing at all, I was binging, and it was awful, and my kanji moved EXTREMELY slowly, for a year and a half.  (Got through RtK1 in about two months&#8230; RtK3 took about 18).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually that made a lot of sense to me. I am really glad that you mentioned to change the way and not skip because it wasn&#039;t the kanji, it was the stories that bored me to death. Also what khatz said about it being ok to skip, it made me feel more relaxed because I realized I was stressing majorly over not doing kanji. I think that I would have seriously have given up. I just wanna say thanks to everyone for your suggestions!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say, I hadn&#039;t fun while reviewing sentences or kanji. Sometimes it&#039;s just one or two horrible kanji that make you want to quit all together. I guess, skipping them is a possibility - and I already did this with vocabulary or sentences - but - and that&#039;s my point: being at 150 kanji in Heisig is merely the beginning. I wouldn&#039;t start skipping at that stage, as the boredom is probably just due to not yet being really accustomed with Heisig-ing.
You&#039;re quite well able to just memorize a few Kanji without really using that spectacular story-method at all and you will only notice after a while that actually you haven&#039;t really been using the method properly in the beginning. At least that is what happened to me: I just read the stories in the beginning, I knew lots of the kanji there anyway (numbers for example) and only later I really knew what is important in a story (it&#039;s not that is has to be oh-so funny or creative, it just has to be a picture that sticks) Sometimes I would have a great story with hardly any relation to the keyword, so I&#039;d never know the kanji...
So, instead of skipping too much (it&#039;s probably always okay to skip about 2-5%, but not 50%), I think, you should just go on. So I wouldn&#039;t delete the kanji, I&#039;d rather review them the next day and make up a new story the next day, if my old one sucked.]]></description>
