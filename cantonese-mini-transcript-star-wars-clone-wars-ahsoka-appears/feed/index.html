					<description><![CDATA[Einar,
This is nothing to do with the AJATT site but I have started to do some small Japanese transcripts myself.
Although I am only a learner and no where near fluent in Japanese, I&#039;m doing my best to keep a record of the things I listen to, play, read, watch etc at www.zenzenwakaran.co.uk

I&#039;m trying my best to listen to the audio clips to make sure I have everything correct before I put it up, and if there are exact subs of the audio somewhere I will just copy them, so perhaps it would help you.
As I said I am still learning so maybe my translations will be a bit off, but the important part is the Japanese transcript right? :-)]]></description>
