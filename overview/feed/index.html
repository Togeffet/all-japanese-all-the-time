					<description><![CDATA[To answer your question, and I&#039;m not 100% sure on this, but from I&#039;ve gathered from elsewhere on this site, at the sentence-mining stage, you won&#039;t know the readings of the kanji, so when you encounter them, you look them up.  The point of studying the kanji that way is so when you do encounter them, they are familiar, you can write them in the correct stroke order, and you can dissect them to guess at their meaning in context.  The only thing left is to find out the kun-yomi and on-yomi.  Sort of like only having to add new information to an index card, instead of having to make a new index card and figuring out how to file it away.  I could be wrong, but as you don&#039;t seem to be getting a response, I thought I&#039;d throw in my two cents and try to help out.  If you find something different, post it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not understand what you mean when you talk about sentence mining. You say learn to read aloud 10,000 sentences, but how do I do that since I do not know the readings of the kanji, only the meaning? Do you suggest reading things where the kana is transposed next to the kanji?

P.S. sorry if this is covered somewhere else already, I am new to this site and it has a massive amount of material to go over.

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I only went keyword--&gt;kanji. The kanji--&gt;keyword recall is slower, but that doesn&#039;t matter. It will take care of itself with reading.

					<description><![CDATA[Just wondering if you review kanji using keyword to kanji only as recommended by Heisig? I got through 2000 earlier this year and found my keyword to kanji recall was good but kanji to keyword recognition was slower and less consistent. Thanks for your help, Chris]]></description>
