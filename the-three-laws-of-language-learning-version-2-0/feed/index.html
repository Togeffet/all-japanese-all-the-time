					<description><![CDATA[I have a new way of starting more times than I stop: I get my watch to tell me when to start.

My watch beeps every hour.  Everytime I hear the beep I do something in Swedish.  

It&#039;s great, I don&#039;t even have to decide when to start, my watch does it for me.  Sometimes I&#039;ll just do SRS for a few minutes.  Sometimes I&#039;ll read websites.  Sometimes I&#039;ll watch TV.  It may last a minute or an hour, so long as it&#039;s fun.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is BS, I didn&#039;t buy the version with extra hard drive space so I can&#039;t download the patch!

And the only deal is the Khatzu9000Drive which is 60 dollars! And they say this stuff is unnecessary?!

It&#039;s a Khatzopoly!]]></description>
