					<description><![CDATA[AS faras the insight of making mistakes go, yes it is true tha children make mistakes but if a child makes a mistake they are correct by the parents teachers, if an adult makes a mistake they have no parents or teachers to correct them an dit is considered rude to correct the. think about it my uni lecturers are all foreign and they make tons of mistakes but no one is going to put the hand up and star correcting their grammer, theyd sound like a d!ck, so the go on assumin there grammer.pronounciatiom was right, but children are corrected all the time.
Also i think that when children learn a language the have no prevoius knowledge of a language to interfier, what they learn is what the know and its what they think in, so there forced to constanly think only in the language theve just learnt as the know nothing else

Yo, Khatzu and the other gentle readers!

I have a question… do you think that correction is worth anything? As in does it help?

Here’s what I’m thinking…
I heard in some of my college linguistics classes that children are pretty much immune to correction. You correct their grammar all you want and they still keep on talking the exact same way until one day… *POOF*… it fixes itself. I’m wondering if we, the “adult learners,” are the same. I know you like to say that there’s no difference from child and adult learners in their ability to learn language, and maybe that’s true. But obviously there’s a difference in THE WAY they learn. And this is also one of your main points.. LOTS OF INPUT. Children get tons of input while a lot of adult learners don’t. So here’s my question a bit restated…

If we’re getting tons of input, do you think our errors will heal themselves in time?

And here’s something else relevant to my question… you’ve often said input before output for fear that we’ll get stuck in our ungrammatical ways and never change (or that it’ll be harder to change in the future). However, once again, what about kids? They speak as soon as they can and are making tons of errors, yet eventually they all move on to be fluent, more or less error-less native speakers. Also, I know a guy who was a Mormon missionary here in Japan for two years. When he came here he only had 3 months of Japanese training. He was here for two years, studying for about an hour every morning and then talking to people on the street for 9 hrs. a day. I’m sure in the beginning he was making lots of errors but now native Japanese speakers say his Japanese is great and very natural.

What’re your thoughts?&quot;]]></description>

I also had that choice, but I refused because I felt a class would only slow me down, having to go at everyone else&#039;s pace while I was racing ahead of them. You can probably learn better on your own, by mimicking real Japanese dialogue rather than stiff classroom Japanese dialogue]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just started the immersion process, similar to as stated here and I will be in it for about 2 months or so. After that I have the chance to have *free* Japanese classes. That&#039;s right, free, provided by the government. Should I go for it? I&#039;ll still continue with my self study, but just a question to anyone who&#039;s reading. It&#039;d help me practice speaking, I guess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[dancc:
You need to install Japanese fonts etc onto your PC. Take a look here:

http://www.declan-software.com/japanese_ime/#vista

or here

http://www.endnote.com/support/helpdocs/Changing%20Regional%20Settings%20in%20Windows%20XP.pdf

If that doesn&#039;t work and the game still shows gibberish, then you need to set the codepage to Japanese

					<description><![CDATA[@X3RO

Even if you don&#039;t quite get the pinpoint details of a sentence quite yet, you just need to understand that gist of it in order to &quot;understand&quot; it as written in the 10,000 sentences articles.  You should start to get a feel for when you &quot;get it&quot; enough or when you don&#039;t.  I highly recommend going with a monolingual dictionary as soon as possible.  Remember that it&#039;s not time wasted; you&#039;re reading the target language after all.]]></description>

You might want to try to start by reading definitions of words you already know. Really simple words. Like 食べる。人。女。男。行く。貴方。何。誰。此処。

I understand your concerns. I&#039;ll just say that it&#039;s like clinging onto the edge of a swimming pool or a skate rink. At some point, it&#039;s time to let go, and get into the middle of the pool/rink, if you really want to swim/skate. Sure, you&#039;ll be shaky initially.
