					<description><![CDATA[What I&#039;v learned so far from learning japanese is that, you must have fun. If you want to get far you must enjoy what your doing. That being said, fun is different for everyone. I&#039;m addicted to srsing but some might not find that fun but I do. I also like immersing,reading,writing,playing around with my full japanese games,novels,mangas,keigo books,etc. But everyone shuold have that general interest of having fun because why else are you doing it then?

It&#039;s finally 18months of me learning japanese. I&#039;ve noticed a few things people should know, maintain srs reps,immersing,read and have fun with what your learning. If you want to do more, set out what to do but limit it to small amounts. So you don&#039;t burn yourself out from learning too much daily. Maintaing is the key to success in language learning. You get more out of what you maintain than what you do daily. How do I know? I&#039;ve reached that 95%+ in the language in terms of reading/listening. I have full confident I will be able to do the same with speaking/writing. We all worry too much about when we will get good but if you have fun everyday,, you will never need to worry because before you know it, you&#039;ll be fluent. I&#039;m feeling really confident I can gain full fluency in all skills of the japanese language.

So please have fun, don&#039;t knock yourself down, don&#039;t do too much srsing. Just maintain and add at a steady pace. 20-30 new cards usual works if you do it right. This blog site has taught me a few good things. Khatz isn&#039;t a genius, he&#039;s just a regular person like anyone  else. He just did what he felt was fun and succeeded in it. Therefore anyone can do it, heck even I&#039;m doing it and I&#039;m not such a smart person but a lot of people believe I am. But in fact, anyone can master another language. If you did it with english, you can do it with any other language.

But a lot of people like to say they don&#039;t have enough time. I hate hearing these things personally. If you really want it so badly, you&#039;ll do it and find time to do it. I personally have school,work,still hang out with friends and I still got tihs far. It isn&#039;t suprising. Just give it time and you&#039;ll get far. 

Before I finish this post I want to say this. If you want to improve writing kanji by hand, keep writing. But how does one do this. With the srs you can master writing all major 2000-3000 kanji with the srs of your choice. kana in the question and kanji in the answer. Put basic vocab,kanji,etc in it/sentences. Then start to increase. I&#039;ve increased my written abilities with this. I won&#039;t have problems writing all those kanji in 1 year from now. So if you think you can&#039;t reach fluency in writing,your wrong,very wrong!

I&#039;ll be sure to post a success story here once I reach complete fluency but until then. Keep having fun,keep learning and lastly just maintain, don&#039;t do too much.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It is not simple to have always fun because it isn&#039;t easy to have the right material.
I&#039;m really interested in Mandarin. I have many links to streaming contents (movies, radio, songs), but for me it is really hard to enjoy them without my computer, or out of my house far from my internet flat contract. Or SRS: no computer, no Anki. I have some songs on my mp3 player, but they&#039;re not enough to have fun all the time, a radio would be better: always contents, no need to choose and download them. I can&#039;t pay for an Ipod or similar to reach contents while moving. Do you think I have to consider such an idea? &#062;_&#062;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know what people mean by it&#039;s difficult to find more fun things to do after a while. I generally don&#039;t enjoy movies, and can&#039;t just take twenty minutes out of my time to watch a TV show. I just don&#039;t find them fun. I&#039;ve helped alleviate that a little by downloading shows I always intended to watch in English, but never got round to, in Russian (currently going through Avatar with a friend who knows it inside and out in English, so he can explain any plot points if I&#039;m missing them), but unfortunately the dubbing business here isn&#039;t good.
And I tried getting games, the text files always end up corrupted! If anyone knows how to fix that, please reply. I think the problem is the format they&#039;re saved in isn&#039;t compatible with my Latin-letter Notepad program, but I can&#039;t only think of maybe uninstalling Notebook to fix it.]]></description>
