					<description><![CDATA[Ok, let&#039;s face it. 
Slowly I came to the end of my first language that I learnt simply by immersion. 
I&#039;ve chosen a language that isn&#039;t that difficult, pleases me and just sounds good in my ears. 
This language was for me Italian. Sure the immerion in Italian will never end, because I wanna stay fit in the language and therefore I organized already a vacation in Italian just to see how it is to live in a country, where immersion is everywhere as long as you avoid stuff from your country. 
But my language lust is still alive... no wonder, I&#039;m 18 years old an my natural lust of languages will take decades to get less. But now let&#039;s face my problem (^^): I want to learn Icelandic. Yep, almost no one speaks it, it won&#039;t give me a big advantage anywhere, but I love the language, just simply as that. But in Italian I had tons of possibilities to immerse myself and now here comes the problem: Will the stuff that is produced in Iceland, be enought to lift me up to fluency or native level? A different problem is that I haven&#039;t found a good dictionary yet. I mean, sure they have there some but it seems that they lack in content... clearly this is just a problem at the beginning before the transition to is-is, but the beginning will decide if I stick to the language...
So can anyone help me? Khatz? How shall we treat languages that lack in ressources for immersion?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[^ Learning without SRS is not natural, but &quot;traditional&quot; method. SRS assisted learning is a fairly recent invention.  

On the article: being a Vietnamese native, I found out bridging English -&#062; Japanese didn&#039;t work well since when you learn a language you also train yourself in that language&#039;s &quot;thought flow&quot;.  English does not share much similarity with Japanese, while my native language does, so it is way easier to learn Japanese by Vietnamese rather than English. I do note loan words/katakana in English though, since they are basically bastardized English. 

Without actual Japanese environment (read: living in Japan) your Japanese will inevitably slips, esp. if you follow full immersion method which this site promotes. One can&#039;t immerse himself in both languages at once.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kinda agree.... a lot of people think you can just translate English words to its spanish equivalent and say the whole phrase... &quot;what time is it?... Oh, it&#039;s twenty to the two!!&quot;, this is called Spanglish, and is created by laddering spanish/english (You can overcome this by going spanish-spanish though, easily).. you dont want to speak like this! 

I learnt english using spanish as a base... and yeah without SRS, in one of the most anti-english countries in the world (chile), .. the natural method baby ;)]]></description>
