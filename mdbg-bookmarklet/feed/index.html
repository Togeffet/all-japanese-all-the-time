					<description><![CDATA[These instructions work on firefox and probably all other browsers.

See the first bullet point, the link &quot;MDBG Bookmarklet&quot; ?  Right click on it, select &quot;Bookmark this link&quot;.  You now have a bookmark called &quot;MDBG Bookmarklet&quot;.  Select/highlight a single kanji character in the text of a web page - for instance from the left column on this page.  Now select &quot;MDBG Bookmarklet&quot; from your bookmark menu.

Be careful not to click elsewhere on the page when selecting the &quot;MDBG Bookmarklet&quot; as that might deselect the kanji in the page text.

Actually, you can select multiple kanji characters and MDBG will return the meanings for each.]]></description>

Hey, man. :) I&#039;ll see if I can help you out with bookmarklets. They confused me for a while, too. Everywhere I&#039;d look, people were talking about these great bookmarklets but nobody ever said how to actually USE them! Haha. So, here we go.
Basically, you make a new bookmark in your web browser of choice (hint: the cool kids use Chrome ;P). You set the name of the bookmark to whatever you like, and instead of putting a URL like you would normally have, you place the Javascript code for the bookmarklet (so, for this bookmarklet, everything from &quot;javascript&quot; to that last &quot;()&quot;). Then to use the bookmarklet, simply click on it in your bookmark list. For this bookmarklet specifically, you highlight a kanji on a web page, then click the bookmarklet. The bookmarklet will then open a new tab featuring a page of a website with the information for the kanji you highlighted. Other bookmarklets work in a similar way. Just play around with them and see; it&#039;s what I had to do, and it showed me some cool stuff. :)

Hope that helped! And please, anybody, correct me if I got some information wrong.]]></description>
