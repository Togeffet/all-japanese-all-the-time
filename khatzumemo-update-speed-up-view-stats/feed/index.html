					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzu,

I hate to complain, because I love your stuff.  And you rock.  But after the second update today, I now have the reverse problem as „Åç„ÅÆ„Åì.  It`s massive.  I had to change the view text to smallest and it was still too much.  Anyways, I use a PC, so I hope that helps.  I actually liked the new look yesterday, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[DO NOT WANT! The background color doesn&#039;t go so well with the text, and the print is now tiny and squashed up in the top middle of the screen somewhere. I had to increase the font size just to read it. Can you at least align the text to the left instead of the middle and make it a little bigger?

Sorry to complain but I feel like my favorite toy&#039;s been taken away.]]></description>
