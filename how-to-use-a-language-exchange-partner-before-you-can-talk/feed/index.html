					<description><![CDATA[Definitely agree. In my case it wasn&#039;t music, but anime. I&#039;m lucky enough to have a 17 year old semi-otaku Japanese boy as a friend that has been able to introduce me to the kinds of anime, games, etc that Japanese kids are actually playing now. Having that resource allows me to find the things that I&#039;d actually be interested in WITHOUT having to sift through a bunch of crap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a good idea, especially for anyone learning the language who knows what he loves in his own. 

For example, it&#039;s a small step from loving The Black Keys (ザ・ブラック・キーズ) to asking if there&#039;s anyone like that in Japan. And it&#039;s easy to spread out from there, as you just need one band, one show, or one book that you really love to get the snowball going. 

Once you&#039;re in an orbit of people who share the same interests or have the same taste as you, it&#039;s almost impossible to not pick up more and more music and shows that you&#039;ll like. But even aside from that, with Japan, if you find one movie that you love, chances are high that there&#039;s a manga for that. One win almost guarantees two.]]></description>
