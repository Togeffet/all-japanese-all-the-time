					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking about trying out the lazy kanji method, but I&#039;m just wondering how to switch, considering I&#039;ve already done over 750 kanji the &quot;normal&quot; Heisig method. Getting through those kanji again would take a while... 

@魔法少女☆かなたん
I think one per hour is perhaps too little, but I decided to try out something similar, and I&#039;m adding one story every 15 minutes, gonna see how that works out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[its normal. just pronounce it the way you read it, and try to catch examples of how a native speaker pronounces &#039;O&#039; vowels just before the &#039;o&#039; particle. yes its somewhat ambiguous when spoken at natural speed, but context should be sufficient to clue you in on the meaning of the sentence as a whole. 

there are similar ambiguities in the sounds of english and every language all the time, that we all have learned to take for granted and that a lot of times we dont even realize exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Then he&#039;ll learn less and be stuck with the bad experience for longer.

I recommend to just try your hardest and learn as many as you can every day until you are finished. (it&#039;s what i did)

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah dude honestly Heisig&#039;s book was boring as heck for me.  I don&#039;t like coming up with stories.  I got to about 120 using the Heisig way and then I couldn&#039;t force myself to keep going.  Granted, those 120 kanji stuck EXTREMELY well, and now I use Lazy Kanji and they don&#039;t stick nearly as well but I actually have fun doing Lazy Kanji so I accept the retention trade-off :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t actually do Heisig because his book was boring. That may be part of your problem, but I don&#039;t have advice for that.

But you could also learn 1 kanji every hour instead 15 every day. Just try it and let us all know how it works out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if somebody could help me with this one... 
Basically, I&#039;m at around 750 kanji in Heisig&#039;s book, and it took me like 2 months to get here. I aim for learning 15 kanji each day, and I&#039;m wondering how I could ensure that I would actually learn those 15 kanji every day instead of skipping every other day because I don&#039;t feel like adding new stories.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a quick question-

If an O group syllable (しょ、こ、ぼ) comes right before an を should it sound obvious?

Such as- 
空所を埋めろ
くうしょ　を　うめろ
when i say it it sounds like kuushyo-o. The を doesn&#039;t sound obvious, but is this normal?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup, people freak out too much about things that are out of their control, when if they&#039;d simply A) Calm down and focus, and B) Focus on those things they can control, then they&#039;d increase their effectiveness several fold. 

I&#039;m not sure, but I&#039;m pretty sure that above passage can be completely expressed with the phrase &quot;Do the best you can with what you&#039;ve got.&quot; or something like that, right? Something along those lines?
