Also, how did you do with the ÂÖ•„Çã verb? I mean, it has different meanings for the same form. It confuses me a lot when I&#039;m picking sentences.]]></description>

CONGRATULATIONS on finishing RTK! w00t!
&gt;(1)Did you learn to count in japanese through sentence mining or you used another method? The same for date and time.
A bit of both. If you google &quot;Japanese numbers&quot; and &quot;Japanese dates&quot;, etc. you should find plenty.
&gt;(2)I‚Äôm looking through materials intended for beginners and in them I see examples from mangas but some words have kana in place of kanji. Should I SRS them as they are or should I replace them with the respective kanji?
I always replaced with the respective kanji. Sure, people often use kana when they could use kanji in daily life, but it is better to do this out of choice than out of ignorance. In my sentences, I kanjified everything that could be kanjified.
&gt;One more doubt. Should I sentence-mine music lyrics or that must wait until some day?
Yeah, go for it. Music lyrics are fine. Sure, some of it is more metaphorical than literal, but it&#039;s fun, it tends to rhyme and you learn words. Go for it.]]></description>

Yep, it&#039;s true and I don&#039;t disagree. It&#039;s just that in the fifth sentence pack Khatz had talked about a &quot;next&quot; sentence pack that (if I went well through all the articles) doesn&#039;t exist. So I was just wondering why he had stopped. And to be honest I haven&#039;t looked at those starter packs yet.

@Chiro-kun
Well...hmmm...It&#039;s somewhat the old way, right? I think so at least. If it has to be that way, then be it but that&#039;s why before going that way I asked Khatz how he had learned the numbers/date/time and now (sorry again, Khatz„Çà) names.]]></description>

I think the sentence packs were only meant as a sort of demonstration of how Khatz did it and at the same time to teach some Japanese. Khatz addressed this in a few posts earlier, but AJATT shouldn&#039;t be confused as just needing to input and practice a lot of sentences. It&#039;s important to have sentences, but it&#039;s also important to see sentences in their natural context. 

Even if a sentence is natural/native Japanese, seeing it mangled in a list with other sentences takes away the natural context. So while those starter packs can help you, it&#039;s also good to start looking for sentences contained in natural Japanese things (songs, movies, product labels, whatever) that have context.]]></description>

Thanks for the congrats. I have already met the kanji for &#039;baka&#039; (a few hours ago) and was surprised to see how probabilities are just what they are, probabilities.

Well, it would be a good idea but I can&#039;t buy the book and I don&#039;t have any way to get it. :(]]></description>

Japanese in Mangaland (the first volume) treats numbers and counting very well. Same goes for days and time. Also, I write the date (as Âπ≥Êàê20Âπ¥ and not 2008) as well as the day on everyday homework assignments and stuff. It really helps you to get acquainted with days and stuff. For numbers, I occasionally translate results of my calculator while doing Maths. That way, I get to practice everyday :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would say that numbers are one of the few things that you should just learn outside of sentences.  It&#039;s pretty easy to learn to say 1-10 just by chanting them.  Perhaps even add an SRS entry which says &#039;1-10&#039; and prompts you to say them in order.  This way you won&#039;t forget them before you encounter them in sentences.
Japanese is pretty simple above 10.  20 is just &#039;two ten&#039; etc.  Then you can just add in 100, 1000, 10000 etc as you encounter them.  
Who cares if you have to count from 1 when you want to know what 8 is.  That&#039;s what children do when they&#039;re learning numbers, and you&#039;re just a Japanese baby after all!!  With practice and exposure to Japanese you&#039;ll just find yourself able to say them in any order.
I guess you could do the same for dates and time too.  Any other counting systems (and there are lots in Japanese thanks to the counters they use) you could just look up the first time you encounter them, to familiarise yourself with, but not actively learn.  

P.S.  A really good hint is to count your kanji strokes in Japanese when you write them.]]></description>
