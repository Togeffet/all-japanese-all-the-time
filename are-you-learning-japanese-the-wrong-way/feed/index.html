					<description><![CDATA[Some very nice advices here. Now, I&#039;m trying to help my girlfriend to learn japanese and I would like to find American TV shows dubbed and subtitles for the same shows. 
(why not go for the Japanese shows? We will get there, but later, when she doesn&#039;t need the subtitles). 

So, anybody there knows some places where I can find both? (dubbed shows AND subtitles)

Most famous shows in Japan would do, like 24 and Alias. Anybody? 

Thanks anyway!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[語学を学ぶ人は、みんな一番の近道だと思って一生懸命お勉強してしまいますね。
お勉強をしてから、その言葉を楽しめるんじゃないかと思って。

自分もそうでした。随分長い間一生懸命英語をお勉強してきたと思います。
今から思うと、近道だと思いつつ、ぜんぜん違う方向に進んでいたと思います。

今は、たくさん英語で本を読み、自分で書いたり、ドラマを英語で見たり。
ただ楽しんでいるだけですが、お勉強していた頃よりずっと力が着いたと思います。

長い時間がかかりましたが、間違っていたことに気づいてよかったと思っています。

みなさんはまだまだ若いから、これからいくらだって日本語を楽しむ時間があります＾＾。



語学は長い旅をするようなもの。
たまには迷子にもなるでしょう。それはそれでまた善しです
間違いに気づいたら、そこからがまた始まりですから＾＾。

近道をさがすのではなくて、

どうぞ日本語の旅をのんびりのんびり楽しんでください。

					<description><![CDATA[I used to think there was a right way, or at least a best way . . .
It&#039;s been about ten years since I started learning Japanese, and I&#039;ve tried lots of methods.  Like tons.  You name it, I probably tried it (including moving to Japan, which is a pretty extreme thing to do just to learn a language, if you think about it).  The programs that were lousy I abandoned quickly, while others I stuck with for years.  (They usually overlapped, since you can study using several different methods at the same time, assuming you&#039;ve got plenty of free time.)  I&#039;ll write more details about those learning adventures on my site, but I&#039;ll share the conclusion right now.
The bottom line is--similar to what Khatz says--it&#039;s not the method so much as the exposure.  You just have to get a lot of (comprehensible) Japanese input.  As long as you&#039;re learning &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; everyday, it almost doesn&#039;t matter what you learn or how you learn it.  You just gotta do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yup. I agree 100%, great article. Especially the part about not striving for absolute perfection.

A couple times, I&#039;ve looked at x media (manga, game, book, whatever) and said, &quot;Ok, I&#039;ll go through this and enter &lt;strong&gt;everything &lt;/strong&gt;I don&#039;t know into Anki.

Yeah, that lasted a couple days. Then I gave up. Never went back to English, but gave up on entering sentences for a while.

Moral of the story? &lt;strong&gt;Slow and steady, slow and steady, slow and steady&lt;/strong&gt;, not fast and perfectionist. (Although if you can handle fast and steady, more power to you).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definitely can relate.  For me, I&#039;ve been unendingly frustrated by listening skills.  I finished RTK in 3 months with Onyomi and Kunyomi, not a problem.  I went on to get reading down super quickly, and even became decent at writing.

but then I kept hitting the brick wall of listening.  I could not hear at even 30% of my ability to read and write.  Therefore, I started listening less, finding myself trying to avoid listening to things I thought I wouldn&#039;t understand.  The one thing I needed to do to fix my biggest frustration in the language I neglected.  However,

I did not stop.   It came in waves.  I would get frustrated and change my listening back to my (low) comfort zone and stay there for awhile, not really making progress.  Then a couple of days later I&#039;d get the courage back up again and turn on something completely new and foreign, get frustrated, go back to my comfort zone, and so on for months.

I really picked the least efficient route to improving my listening by trying to avoid it.  But I did not stop.  I just kept starting.  AND IT WORKS!!!?!?!?!???!?!!!!!!?!?!?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been about a year since I bought some kanji cards and realized that right off the bat I made a mistake, I should have bought hiragana and katakana cards. Not even day one and BOOM already failed, ha ha. Instead of feeling all sheepish and what not, I laughed it off, went back to the store and bought the hiragana / katakana decks. I can definitely relate アンソニー in some ways. During my first year, I would worry constantly about not GETTING IT. Now, I just realize that I don&#039;t get it so I pick up a dictionary or some learning material, study it and GET IT! It&#039;s not going to kill me to not know a word or two or 300 etc. at this point. Accept where you are but also pick out another place you want to be and get there, at your pace. I can already see a difference this year, my 2nd learning Japanese, and the way my attitude is towards learning it. Much more easy going about it, but if anything, I&#039;m much more aware of what I am learning now. Who would have thought that time and effort pay off!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes the wrong way is also the right way because it&#039;s virtually the only way.  I began learning Japanese for fun a few years ago while I couldn&#039;t really afford to put much effort into it as I was working on my degree 24/7, doing All Mathematics All The Time.  Unfortunately, you can only be immersed into &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; thing at a time.  Nevertheless I took tiny steps on the side that couldn&#039;t possibly get me distracted too much, I experimented with a lot of different textbooks and materials one at a time, deliberately choosing less efficient but more stable methods that didn&#039;t require more than an hour a day of my relaxed time.  I tried to address one issue at a time that I felt was the most beneficial element. There was a time, 6 months perhaps, when I didn&#039;t do anything Japaneesy except the RTK I reps until I became confident in 常用漢字, and then I moved on to RTK II and spent about 8 months until I was confident in 音読み (it worked but I wouldn&#039;t recommend that to anyone sane), and then about half of my daily time for Japanese went to maintaining that clunky knowledge.  Slow but steady progress kept me motivated, as well as the desire to see for myself how wrong the &#039;wrong&#039; way is, actually.  I wasn&#039;t in touch with actual Japanese much, but I kept mastering its elements through various means.  When I discovered AJATT, it was a tremendous eye-opener and I immediately began trying it out only to discover that it gave me too little control under the circumstances.  I ordered a fair amount of interesting stuff in Japanese, but I couldn&#039;t just take it from the shelf and use it because that would cut into my valuable time doing mathematics.  Then I finally got my long-desired degree last Summer (and maybe fluent in mathematics along with it, I was severely burned out and didn&#039;t care at the time so it&#039;s hard to tell), and that&#039;s when Japanese began to take off.  While I haven&#039;t abandoned my inefficient methods entirely yet, I actually moved to authentic materials and it seems that now I can watch or read or listen to pretty much anything, listening over and over to various segments and picking out words and pieces of grammar as I go along, which feels like the natural, rewarding exponential growth that would lead anyone to fluency in a relatively short period of time even with moderate effort, perhaps a couple of years, instead of a decade of the boring and unnatural (because the brain is a neural network, not a traditional computer) linear growth with a huge risk of dropping out entirely.
Anyway, while learning languages the AJATT way is a very good idea, I think that it wouldn&#039;t work under some circumstances.  Not giving up and just doing anything that&#039;s doable towards the still excruciatingly distant goal, however, would always work long-term, as circumstances would eventually change and you would be in a much better position because 1) maybe you wouldn&#039;t have had the pot boiling, but you would have kept the fire burning, and 2) you would have made some progress, which may not seem like a lot, but it&#039;s &lt;em&gt;tremendously&lt;/em&gt; significant because it was &lt;em&gt;early on&lt;/em&gt;.]]></description>

Anyway, while learning languages the AJATT way is a very good idea, I think that it wouldn&#8217;t work under some circumstances.  Not giving up and just doing anything that&#8217;s doable towards the still excruciatingly distant goal, however, would always work long-term, as circumstances would eventually change and you would be in a much better position because 1) maybe you wouldn&#8217;t have had the pot boiling, but you would have kept the fire burning, and 2) you would have made some progress, which may not seem like a lot, but it&#8217;s <em>tremendously</em> significant because it was <em>early on</em>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Very nice post. I can&#039;t stress how important just going forward is and not giving up.
There were times in the past when I went all 絶望 and felt bad, felt burnout on Kanji, and ended up taking few days break from Kanji. But then I realized, Doing a bad job is better than doing no job at all, so It doesn&#039;t matter If I could only do a few kanji a day, it&#039;s still better than 0. Luckily I got myself together and plowed through the last 500 kanji during spring break like a total boss. Now I&#039;m at 2500 sentences and just finished reading a wikipedia article on 下痢 and nodded my head to understanding a lot of it :P If I would have given up, There is no way i could be where I am now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really find this website helpful because of, among other things, posts like these. I am quite new to learning Japanese, and I haven&#039;t even watched anime or read manga regularly, so I&#039;m starting completely from scratch. After studying for perhaps one month now, I&#039;ve gone through 5 chapters of the &lt;em&gt;Genki I&lt;/em&gt; book and I&#039;m at almost 600 漢字 in RTK.
It would be wise to first mention that I want to move to Japan in the future and become as proficient in the language as possible, and come close to the famed &lt;em&gt;native fluency&lt;/em&gt;. 
Recently, I&#039;ve read some comments about people who think that &quot;If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to become fluent and have a native-like thought map, you should at least use the &lt;em&gt;Kumon&lt;/em&gt; books for kanji, it gives superior literal fluency...&quot;. Being, as I said, at almost 600 漢字 in RTK, I of course started freaking out and wondering if I made the wrong decision in getting RTK, taking into account what I wrote about my long-term goals earlier in this post (I even didn&#039;t study from RTK for a day or two)...
However, I tend to agree with what アンソニー concludes with, and I think that RTK will definitely pay off, even if some people do not think highly of it and its mnemonics.
Thanks for reading, and thanks for the site and your work, Khatzumoto様!]]></description>
