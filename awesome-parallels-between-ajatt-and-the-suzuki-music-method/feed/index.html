					<description><![CDATA[Anyone familiar with any resources (books, blogs etc.) that apply AJATT-like approach to learning music? I&#039;d be very interested in learning a musical instrument in a way I learned L2. Apart from listening to lots of music you&#039;d like to play, what would the method be? Playing by ear? What&#039;s the SRS equivalent for music?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a very interesting post. I did a little reading, and it seems that these are the language factors that the Suzuki method is predicated upon:
Listening 
 Motivation 
 Repetition 
 Step-by-step mastery 
 Memory 
 Vocabulary 
 Parental Involvement 
 Love
( http://www.suzukimusic.org.au/suzuki.htm )
It&#039;s likely that if you apply these factors (with some minor tweaks to the verbiage) to almost any significant endeavor, including sports and work, you will have success. As with learning Japanese, it&#039;s just a matter of perseverance and time.

					<description><![CDATA[I started learning to play the violin when I was about ten years old. Young enough to still be pliable, but old enough that I could later examine how I learned best. I have to say that I did better when we practiced real pieces and played real performances than any of the theory (which I only learned because I had to be able to read the sheet music).
I could still dust off that knowledge and play in a local orchestra if I wanted to (and I plan to soon). That&#039;s how well learning through actual use ingrains things in your head. It even helps with related things as well. I started learning to play piano and it only took two hours or so for me to get accustomed to the keys since I already knew what it should sound like (wish I had some pieces to practice at the time, but I was an idiot and didn&#039;t prepare anything). Of course, I&#039;m still a beginner, but I had a greater advantage compared to someone who&#039;d never played an instrument before. Kind of like the Heisig method if you ask me.
 
Now, I&#039;m learning Japanese. The words and kanji I remember best are the ones I see while reading manga (I need the context). Even using Anki and the &#039;lazy kanji mod&#039; deck (which is the only way I managed to get through them all), I still can&#039;t quite get it worked in until I&#039;ve actually used it for real. 
I have several albums of Japanese music that I like (this is actually quite the feat. I don&#039;t like most of the music I&#039;ve found) running in shuffle on my mp3 player that I listen to when I&#039;m working, doing SRS reps, or any other time I don&#039;t really need my ears for other things. Even then, I can always deal with one ear if possible. Listening to the sounds all the time really helps you to pick them out better. I have other audio sources, but they&#039;re not as reliable (the occasional video or something like that).
 
Anyway, I hope that in the future, I can make similar comments about my Japanese skills as I can my music skills. Like that I can dust it off if I go too long without using it and that it helps jump start me into other languages if I decide to learn another (highly likely).]]></description>
