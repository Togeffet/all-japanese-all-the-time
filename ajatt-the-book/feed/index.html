					<description><![CDATA[I dunno if I spelled my name correctly in japanese. „Åî„ÇÅ„Å™„Åï„ÅÑ

I was looking at the home page and I thought I had to learn the kanas first. This is my 2nd day studying japanese, I learnt the hiragana yesterday and tomorrow I will tackle the katakanas, from there on I will just review them and start getting some kanji under my belt. I&#039;m using Remebering the Kana (part 1 is hiragana part 2 is katakana) and Remebering the Kanji. Why does this RTK have the kanji pronunciation? When do I start learning the pronunciation? Should I learn the pronunciation at the same time I&#039;m learning the Kanji? If not, why not?  

Anywho, I&#039;ve been reading this website and was a little confused regarding the order ni which I should study japanese and today everything got straighten out just by looking at the new homepage graph. Pretty neat.

Keep up the good work. „Åò„ÇÉ

					<description><![CDATA[Also, if you can&#039;t afford the Text-to-Speech stuff right away, this site has kind of a demo where you can just plug in the words and get results from different voices. I record the sound with a program called Audacity (google it) and plug it into my SRS. You become a better speaker in a FAST amount of time.

					<description><![CDATA[Uh, not a rewrite but I&#039;d like to suggest a short version. You do like to ahem, digress. Three is supposed to be the perfect number. Some say it&#039;s six. So, in a few pages please explain AJATT to us and your road to proficiency. I remember you mentioned somewhere it was actually less than 10,000 sentences that did it, but it&#039;s difficult to find some of these interesting details in this sea of...good will  :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

It&#039;s a great improvement. I was showing this site to a friend the other and had a bit of trouble deciding in what order to show him the various articles.

I also just want to point out under &quot;Physical Environment&quot; you have posted the No speak english article twice. I noticed this because I am hardcore and my mind is like a steel trap (really).

					<description><![CDATA[I was going through the archives some time ago and I saw one of your older posts which has a link which goes something like &quot;this has been significantly improved recently, click here for the newer post&quot;. My first thought was &quot;damn, what else has been improved recently?&quot;

Having that in mind, maybe there should be some sort of note or something at the beginning of the posts which are &quot;old stuff&quot; - the ones which have a newer post which surpasses the old one.

It could be something like &quot;NOTE: While this worked for me at the time of using, I have found what I believe to be a better way of doing this. I suggest you read this more for the sake of understanding my thought process and the evolution of my learning methods than for actual use.&quot;.

The note can be in the post itself, or you could write a small explanation in this overview post, with something like colours or italics to differentiate between posts (stuff which has been improved is italicized, or the letters are in a different colour). Oh, and it should be really visible on both the About page (for new people, or those who come to your site without typing in /blog) and the page with the latest posts (for those who come directly to /blog)

In any case, big thanks and kudos for doing this :) it was quite necessary, and probably not the easiest thing to do.]]></description>
