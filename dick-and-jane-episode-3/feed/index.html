					<description><![CDATA[Awesome. I just started reading these, and I&#039;m having lots of fun. Really! The repetition is both funny, and useful. I read two episodes last night, and, today I&#039;m going to back through, read them a few more times and pick some sentences. I absolutely love the use of all the Kanji, it aids in understanding, and reminds you constantly of their meaning. And, the short descriptions that go along with things like でしょう, and filler things like まぁ... these are excellent. 

Thanks. This learner of Japanese appreciates your hard work. :)]]></description>
