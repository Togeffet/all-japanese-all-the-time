					<description><![CDATA[Input is really important, especially when you&#039;re a beginner/intermediate learner.
If you never use your target language you will become bored of it. A long time ago, when I was learning Italian, I wasn&#039;t able to order books on the internet yet.
As a result, I stopped learning Italian. That might sound radical but given that I&#039;d been studying the same two grammar/vocabulary/conjugations books for 3 months straight, it shouldn&#039;t be so surprising after all.

The only show I had access to was Deal or No Deal, so I quickly said &quot;No Deal&quot; and gave up.

Now I know that if I started over I could find more material.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[actually that&#039;s wrong....... I started SRSing SINCE December 2011, right from the start of my immersion. after 3 months of immersion (with SRSing involved, so in other words around March 2012, I was already able to hold basic IM chats and Email conversation in German with other Germans and Austrians.... who all said that they couldn&#039;t believe that my German was so good after 3 months.. and to this day i still talk to Germans, Austrians, and Swiss people online, who say my German is very good. But saying that I spent a year immersing before SRSing is COMPLETELY FALSE!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes when I read these success stories, I wonder how so much progress could be made so quickly. Sometimes I find them a little demotivational, but I think this post has shed some light on the mystery.

Jamie mentions that she had been doing German immersion for a about a year, but nothing came of it until she began SRSing. Three months later, she was having amazing results. Maybe I&#039;m not giving SRS enough credit, but I think that the year prior to her SRSing may have been worth more than she thought. 

I&#039;ve found that in my continuing journey through Japanese, before you can truly understand phrases or sentences in a foreign language, you have to be used to hearing/seeing them, whether you understand them or not. I know this concept isn&#039;t new to AJATTeer&#039;s - it&#039;s written in the site&#039;s header after all - but even so, I have a feeling Jamie was already used to a lot of German, and just got an extra boost from SRSing because it helped bridge gaps that she hadn&#039;t been bridging before (through bi/monolingual hints).

Maybe I&#039;m jaded from my journey. Maybe that&#039;s why I feel a little demotivated when I read success stories like this. However, I bet I&#039;m not the only one, so I hope someone else feels comforted in the idea that Jamie&#039;s results were from her 1 1/4 years of hard work, rather than 90 days of SRS.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not to be too cynical about your process, Khatz, but part of the secret here is that Jamie is an English-speaker, and her target language was German.
