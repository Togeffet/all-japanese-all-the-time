You don&#039;t have to understand something entirely to be able to get something out of it. If you really can&#039;t get anything out of the article in Japanese at all, and you&#039;re interested in it, simply follow the link and go down to &quot;English&quot; on the left, and click it.

					<description><![CDATA[Brilliant, brilliant post...I guess we could all benefit from some minimalism in our busy lives.
BTW I came in contact with GTD thanks to AJATT, and it really helped me make better choices based on stronger &quot;NO!&quot;s and a much more focused engagement with the tasks at hand.
GTD has it&#039;s place, but it shouldn&#039;t become our next obession/religion.
Still, I consider both Khatz and David Allen to be great role models to follow, and two of my personal heroes :) ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more. But here&#039;s the real secret, shared with only a few people, and the rest of you I&#039;ll have to kill. Getting Things Done is not about getting things done. It&#039;s about appropriate engagement. And, to your well-placed point, many times appropriate engagement means NOT getting something done. But, of course, if you&#039;re here (on the planet, in your room, on the bus) to get something done (which I&#039;ll bet is true), if you&#039;re not getting it done, you&#039;re not appropriately engaged. So, something won&#039;t be on &quot;cruise control&quot; and it will hijack your ability to be present, in the moment, with life. 
Loved the blog; keep it coming.
All the best,
David Allen]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had once the pleasure of working for a CEO who on my first day at the job saw me writing a list... he said to me &quot;throw that away, and just do this one thing for me, because this one thing is important to the company (that one thing was an small little php web-app to capture info from one software to our set of tools). That was all he wanted me to do. As time went on he had this same mindset for almost every process of the company, where no one was ever working on more than 2 things at a time... quite efficient! I learned a great deal working with that man.


&quot;That one thing should be so important, so valuable, that if it were the only thing you did the entire day (or what’s left of it), your day would still be a roaring success. That’s the kind of imbalance I’m talking about.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Slightly difficult to follow in some parts, even for you Khatzumoto, but very encouraging nonetheless! This post reminds me of this excellent post by Gwern about the irrelevancy of most stress: http://www.gwern.net/On%20Stress
An excerpt:

&quot;Similarly, it is not required of you that you dine at fine restaurants night and day - merely that you live in good health. A 50-lb bag of dog food will last you around 17 days (assuming you eat quite a bit every day); that, potable water (freely available), and a large multivitamin (around 100 days). The food would be around $20, the multivitamins amortized over several 17-day periods perhaps $3, and then an indeterminate amount for gas; let us put expenses at perhaps 30 dollars. A single soda bottle can be redeemed for ¢5, so to cover your expenses would require the redemption of 600 cans, or 36 cans a day, or 2.25 cans per waking hour. Is this an onerous task?&quot;

The slave metaphor that you mention has been buzzing around my brain for quite a while. In reality, most of us, economically, are slaves or prisoners to our society and the organizations that constitute them. We do their dirty work to acquire food and shelter. In that sense, people like Warren Buffet are really just escape artists. Really...Warren doesn&#039;t need social skills at all anymore. In america, even panhandling for a living is in a sense illegal since you cannot pay for housing with such an income, and you are required to pay someone else for housing in america if you do not want to get arrested for things like sleeping in public view. 
In reality, doing the minimum to control your own destiny and survive, as gwern points out, really isn&#039;t that much. Though I frequently kvetch about my poopy university, I know that all I really need to do is have enough food and water to survive. In my spare time, I publish ebooks to amazon, barnes and noble, and other platforms, and the few i have done have earned me a small but reliable pittance which i could survive on in a pinch. 
Anyway, such a life would be glorious for the amount of free time available to me.]]></description>

<p>&#8220;Similarly, it is not required of you that you dine at fine restaurants night and day &#8211; merely that you live in good health. A 50-lb bag of dog food will last you around 17 days (assuming you eat quite a bit every day); that, potable water (freely available), and a large multivitamin (around 100 days). The food would be around $20, the multivitamins amortized over several 17-day periods perhaps $3, and then an indeterminate amount for gas; let us put expenses at perhaps 30 dollars. A single soda bottle can be redeemed for ¢5, so to cover your expenses would require the redemption of 600 cans, or 36 cans a day, or 2.25 cans per waking hour. Is this an onerous task?&#8221;</p>
<p>The slave metaphor that you mention has been buzzing around my brain for quite a while. In reality, most of us, economically, are slaves or prisoners to our society and the organizations that constitute them. We do their dirty work to acquire food and shelter. In that sense, people like Warren Buffet are really just escape artists. Really&#8230;Warren doesn&#8217;t need social skills at all anymore. In america, even panhandling for a living is in a sense illegal since you cannot pay for housing with such an income, and you are required to pay someone else for housing in america if you do not want to get arrested for things like sleeping in public view.<br />
In reality, doing the minimum to control your own destiny and survive, as gwern points out, really isn&#8217;t that much. Though I frequently kvetch about my poopy university, I know that all I really need to do is have enough food and water to survive. In my spare time, I publish ebooks to amazon, barnes and noble, and other platforms, and the few i have done have earned me a small but reliable pittance which i could survive on in a pinch.<br />
Anyway, such a life would be glorious for the amount of free time available to me.</p>
