								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dick and Jane continue to learn more about Hansel and Gretel. Who are they, and where have they come from? And what&#8217;s Mr. Brown planning? Find out more!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/Dick+Jane.Ep012.gif" /></p>
<p>第　十二　話　やで (PL2)<br />
Episode 12, Dude!<br />
第 【だい】 ordinal prefix<br />
十二 【じゅう・に】 twelve;<br />
話 【はなし】 episode<br />
や[is] this is a regional dialect version of だ. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to:<br />
<a href="http://www.thejapanesepage.com/readarticle.php?article_id=216">The Japanese Page</a><br />
で　 [emphasis]
<p>前回<br />
Previously<br />
前回 【ぜん・かい】 previous installment</p>
<p>何処　から　来ました　か (PL3)<br />
Where are you from?<br />
何処 【ど・こ】 (n) (uk) where<br />
から [from]
来る 【くる】 (vk) to come from. The polite past form is 来ました　(prounounced: きました). For more on this verb, visit the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/breen/wwwjdic?1W%CD%E8%A4%EB_vk">WWWJDIC</a>.</p>
<p>ん　だ　よ　お前 (PL1-2)<br />
What the heck is wrong with you?<br />
ん is short for 何<br />
何 【なん】 what<br />
だ/です is (copula)<br />
よ [emphasis]
For more on the Japanese copula, visit any of these fine links:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese:Elementary_Japanese:_Lesson_2#What_is_a_copula.3F">Wikibooks</a><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Japanese:Elementary_Japanese:_Lesson_2#What_is_a_copula.3F"><br />
</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula#Japanese">Wikipedia</a><br />
<a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/jgrammar/grammar/jgr_vcop.htm">Nifty</a><br />
<a href="http://www.epochrypha.com/japanese/da_forms.html">Epocrypha</a><br />
お前 【お・まえ】 you (familiar, singular)</p>
<p>接客 じゃね～ よ 馬鹿 (PL1)<br />
Don&#8217;t &#8220;I&#8217;m receiving guests&#8221; me, you egit!<br />
接客 【せっ・きゃく】 receiving guests<br />
じゃね～ is the colloquial version of じゃない (is not). じゃない is short for では(わ）ない. △△△じゃね～よ often has the meaning of &#8220;don&#8217;t △△△ me!&#8221; Note: there is a tendency, in very slangy Japanese such as that spoken by Jane, for words ending in あい or　おい sounds to have their endings changed to an ええ sound<br />
よ [emphasis]
馬鹿 【ばか】 idiot, egit</p>
<p>今回<br />
This time<br />
今回 【こん・かい】 this time</p>
<p>私達 です か (PL3)<br />
Us?<br />
私達 【わたし・たち】Us<br />
です is (the copula crops up again)<br />
か [question particle]
<p>ってか、他 に 誰 が 居る か (PL2)<br />
Well, who else could it be?<br />
ってか　[Well, like]. Short for って言うか or と言うか. Can also have the meaning of &#8220;by the way&#8221;.<br />
他【ほか】 other<br />
に [particle] Here, に serves a function similar to that of &#8220;-ly&#8221; in English; it turns 他 into an adverb so that 他 can modify the verb 居る. In other words, it is helping to describe an action or situation (see <a href="http://dictionary.www.infoseek.co.jp/?ii=14&#038;sm=1&#038;sc=1&#038;gr=ml&#038;qt=%A4%CB&#038;sv=KO&#038;lp=0">#10 on the に entry in the Infoseek Dictionary</a>).<br />
誰【だれ】 who<br />
が　[subject particle]
居る 【いる】 [to be]
か [question particle]
Remember that in Japanese, a particle always acts on the word or words that comes BEFORE it!</p>
<p>厳しい (PL2)<br />
Mean!<br />
厳しい 【きびしい】</p>
<p>まぁ (PL3)<br />
Well</p>
<p>一方<br />
一方 【いっぽう】 Meanwhile</p>
<p>ドイツ　から　来ました (PL3)<br />
We&#8217;re from Germany<br />
ドイツ [Germany]
から [from]
来る 【くる】 (vk) to come from.</p>
<p>ハンセル　登場!　最近凄い人気<br />
Enter, Hansel! He&#8217;s so hot right now!<br />
ハンセル [Hansel]
登場 【とう・じょう】 (1) entry (on stage); (2) appearance (on screen)<br />
最近 【さい・きん】 lately<br />
凄い 【すごい】 incredible. Technically, 凄い should appear here in its connective form: 凄く (すごく). But this is a common Japanese native speaker &#8220;error&#8221; &#8212; kind of like how Americans often respond to the question &#8220;How are you?&#8221; with &#8220;I&#8217;m good&#8221; rather than &#8220;I&#8217;m fine&#8221;.<br />
人気 【にん・き】　popular</p>
<p>ドイツ　人　です (PL3)<br />
ドイツ人 [Germans]
We are Germans</p>
<p>何で　ハモって　ん　だ (PL2)<br />
What the speaking at the same time is going on here?<br />
何で 【なんで】 Why? What for?<br />
ハモる (v5r) to be in harmony; to say the same thing at the same time as someone else.<br />
ん here is short for の. For an explanation of this use of の, please refer the following fine sites:<br />
Tae Kim&#8217;s <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/particles3.html">&#8220;The 「の」 particle as explanation&#8221;</a><br />
だ/です [is] is again, the copula</p>
<p>続く<br />
To be continued<br />
続く 【つづく】 to be continued;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow! Laziness is hard work! As you know, I&#8217;ve been tweaking with ways both to create and display Dick and Jane more efficiently&#8230;mostly creation really. Anyway, here&#8217;s Dick and Jane in the new, shorter format. And now the text is vertical, for added Japanese realness! The excitement is killer, so try to keep your knickers dry while you enjoy this new episode.</p>
<p><! -- more -- ></p>
<p><img src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/Dick+Jane.Ep011.gif" /></p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the English? Right here! Here&#8217;s the commentary for this Episode.</p>
<p>第　十一　話 や　で (PL2)<br />
だい　じゅう・いち　わ　や　で<br />
Ordinal-prefix 11 Episode [is] [emphasis]
It&#8217;s the 11th Episode, man!<br />
■OK, this really probably shouldn&#8217;t be in a &#8220;beginner&#8221; text, but what the heck, who cares &#8212; we want to do cool stuff, right?　やで is 関西弁 (Kansai dialect) for だぜ or だぞ. Kansai&#8217;s is the biggest &#8220;non-standard&#8221; dialect of Japanese; it is real Japanese and you will hear it a lot, so you might as well get used to it now. Of course, the Japanese you usually read will be 関東 Kantou/Tokyo &#8220;standard&#8221; Japanese.<br />
■Why did I put this there? Because it&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s something a Japanese author might do. It gives it a funny feel. It&#8217;s<br />
■In this case 話 is pronounced わ, not はなし</p>
<p>前回<br />
ぜん・かい<br />
Previous time<br />
Previously</p>
<p>私　は　子供　です (PL3)<br />
わたし　は（わ）　こ・ども　です<br />
I as-for children is<br />
I&#8217;m more into children, myself</p>
<p>よし 出発 (PL2)<br />
よし　しゅっ・ぱつ<br />
Right, departure<br />
Right, off we go!<br />
■よし is a word said when the speaker has come to a decision on something and/or is about to take action. Mr. Brown&#8217;s is a very common situation in which to use よし.<br />
■Note that 出発 (しゅっぱつ） is not しゅつはつ. 出, in kanji combinations is usually read by its on-yomi, so  &#8220;しゅつ&#8221;, and 発 is read &#8220;はつ&#8221;. When you mash something that ends in -つwith something else that starts with a consonant, there&#8217;s a high probability of getting a doubled consonant, hence しゅっぱつ instead of しゅつはつ. Other examples are 出血 (しゅっけつ） and 出品（しゅっぴん）.<br />
■More often than not, よし comes out sounding like よっし (yosssshh)</p>
<p>嫌 だ (PL2)<br />
いや　だ<br />
Disagreable is<br />
Nooooooooooo<br />
■嫌だ may also be written やだ or やーだ. This is informal, like writing &#8220;come on&#8221; as &#8220;c&#8217;mon&#8221;.</p>
<p>これ は 危ない (PL2)<br />
此れ　は（わ）　あぶない<br />
This as-for dangerous is<br />
We&#8217;re in deep dooh-dooh</p>
<p>今回<br />
こん・かい<br />
This time</p>
<p>御　二人 (PL3-4)<br />
お　ふたり<br />
Honorable　two-people<br />
The two of you&#8230;</p>
<p>何処 から 来ました か (PL3)<br />
どこ　から　きました　か<br />
Where from came [question]
Where are you from?<br />
■来る（くる）</p>
<p>ん　だ　よ　お前 (PL1-2)<br />
ん　だ　よ　おまえ<br />
What is [emphasis] you<br />
&#8216;The heck is wrong with you??<br />
■ん is short for 何（なん）<br />
■お前＝御前<br />
■お前 can carry a lot of condescension with it, so don&#8217;t go using it. Don&#8217;t talk like Jane at all, not until you&#8217;re sure who you&#8217;re with/where you stand socially and what you&#8217;re doing linguistically with the Japanese language. <strong>Understand</strong> Jane, <strong>imitate</strong> Dick.</p>
<p>だって　接客　です　もの (PL3)<br />
だって　せっきゃく　です　もの<br />
Because receiving/welcoming-guests is thing/matter<br />
I&#8217;m receiving guests<br />
■だって△△△ですもの or だって△△△だもの is a colloquial (i.e. used in speech rather than writing) sentence pattern used to justify one&#8217;s actions. It&#8217;s most often used by females, so it&#8217;s potentially out of character for a male, but not out of character for Dick.</p>
<p>接客　じゃね～　よ　馬鹿 (PL1-2)<br />
せっきゃく　じゃねー　よ　ばーか<br />
Receiving/welcoming-guests is-not [emphasis] idiot<br />
Don&#8217;t &#8220;I&#8217;m receiving guests&#8221; me, you <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=egit">egit</a>.<br />
■じゃねえ/じゃねー etc. is a slangy version of じゃない(じゃ無い）. In slangy Japanese, a lot of things that sound like -あい or -おいbecome ええ. It can be a bit &#8220;gangsta&#8221; or at least thuggish in the impression it gives, so don&#8217;t go out and use it (like I used to), but you will see and hear it a LOT, so you need to know what&#8217;s up.<br />
■In situations like this, 馬鹿（ばか） will be often be stretched out so it sounds like ばーか</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Sorry for the silence! I&#8217;ve been busily looking for better ways to put up &#8220;Dick and Jane&#8221; and other readers/comics. No results so far.</p>
<p>The way Dick and Jane works right now, is that you have one large image file (made up of like 40 smaller image files) per episode.</p>
<p>The problem is that it takes a few seconds to load on a broadband connection, and perhaps longer on dial-up.</p>
<p>If you any suggestions for a better user interface/look-and-feel in general for it, please let me know. Also if you know any good webcomic/image management systems that work with WordPress, do let me know.</p>
<p>Either way, feel free to leave a comment, or send an email to<br />
khatzumoto at alljapaneseallthetime dot com.</p>
