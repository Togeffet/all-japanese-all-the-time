McGregor&#8217;s one and only chance at victory exists if Mayweather&#8217;s lost his conditioning.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I met a German girl at a cafe today&#8230;actually, she was Austrian but, same difference. Anyway, we got to talking about books and  I gave her a <a href="http://is.gd/VFeg84">book recommendation</a>, and it came out that I&#8217;ve only ever read the book in Japanese, so I had to find out what the English title was. She was shocked (or maybe surprised&#8230;whatever, same difference), and she talked about how she could never learn Japanese. And I was like, no way, of course you could.</p>
<p>Because, here&#8217;s the thing. I have a lot of positive stereotypes about German people. There was my friend and neighbour Wolfgang (actual name), who would slice, spread, lay out and eat his afternoon teatime Nutella baguette slices with ruthless &#8212; almost mechanical &#8212; forethought, precision and efficiency. And then there&#8217;s the punctuality thing, of which I am a big (if imperfect) fan. If you send me an email, Heaven help you, but if we have a face-to-face meeting, I will be there a good ten minutes before time, and that&#8217;s in large part thanks to the influence of my German friends in college; I slept with dogs and caught their fleas.</p>
<p>Now I just likened a group of people to dogs&#8230;no good can come of this.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>The point is, I like to think that I learned Japanese &#8220;like a German&#8221;, that is, in a calm, directed, systematic, way. Of course, I wung it where winging it was appropriate and effective &#8212; I was systematic, not mechanical; I&#8217;m too lazy to be mechanical &#8212; that&#8217;s why I have the SRS be mechanical for me. I tackled finite, clearly defined tasks &#8212; kanji, cards &#8212; with unstoppable forward motion.</p>
<p>And yet, you won&#8217;t hear much talk of vocabulary lists here at AJATT. Why is that? Are they evil?</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a lot more complicated than that. Live in East Asia for a while, and you&#8217;ll overcome your desire to classify everything into two categories, where one has completely (or even mostly) positive attributes and the other equally and oppositely negative ones. The<a href="http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/dkadg206/bg2/alignment.html"> character alignment system</a> that I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://suesuo.blog.fc2.com/blog-entry-58.html">seeing around the Internets lately</a> goes a long way toward helping people outgrow this.</p>
<p>Back on topic.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Right With Vocabulary Lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They imply (correctly and helpfully) that the language is finite and tractable
<ul>
<li>Human language is &#8212; thankfully &#8212; capable of infinite variation, but all those permutations and combinations are based on repeating a large but finite set of parts. There are an infinite number of numbers possible, but only ten digits in the Arabic numeral system. Similarly, there are only about two hundred (give or take) repeating parts in the kanji system. There are only about four hundred possible sounds in Mandarin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They give you something to focus your attention and energy on (instead of free-floating anxiety and self-loathing)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/mastery-is-mastering-the-basics">Can help people to focus on simple, foundational knowledge &#8212; the basics, whose mastery is the essence of mastery itself</a></li>
<li>They&#8217;re really good for handling small subsets of the language, like days of the week and months of the year</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s Wrong With Vocabulary Lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In a nutshell: people and how they use them</li>
<li>People start to feel wedded to their lists</li>
<li>People feel obligated to go through every single word in the list. This is bad. Stop as soon as bored.
<ul>
<li>Doing good in one area is not license to do harm in others
<ul>
<li>Yes, a surgeon gets to cut you up so he can heal you, but just because your parents feed and clothe you, doesn&#8217;t mean they get to beat and rape you as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similarly, just because a word is on your vocabulary list, exists in the language and is &#8220;useful&#8221;, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to suffer and bore yourself in order to &#8220;learn&#8221; it</li>
<li><strong>Every word you don&#8217;t know in a document you want to read (or that is about a topic you&#8217;re interested in, e.g. the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E6%AE%BB%E6%A9%9F%E5%8B%95%E9%9A%8A"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> entry in L2 WikiPedia</a>) is <em>already</em> an implicit vocabulary list</strong></li>
<li>Even the best rugby players don&#8217;t try to tackle two people at the same time (in part because you&#8217;re only allowed to go for the guy with the ball&#8230;I think). So tackle one and only one word at a time, one and only one article at a time.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t learn a language, you learn quanta &#8212; sounds, words, phrases</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning single words without context
<ul>
<li>A word is almost meaningless without its context</li>
<li>A word without context is multiple accidents waiting to happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning words between languages as though a one-to-one correspondence existed. It simply doesn&#8217;t, not even at the simplest level, not even between closely related languages like English and French or Mandarin and Cantonese.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How To Use Them Without Being Used By Them</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use vocabulary lists the way you use the TV guide &#8212; as a starting/focal point to your viewing experience, not as an ultimate authority</li>
<li><strong>Every word you don&#8217;t know in a document you want to read (or that is about a topic you&#8217;re interested in, e.g. the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%94%BB%E6%AE%BB%E6%A9%9F%E5%8B%95%E9%9A%8A"><em>Ghost in the Shell</em> entry in L2 WikiPedia</a>) is <em>already</em> an implicit vocabulary list &#8212; use that</strong>. So&#8230;you don&#8217;t actually need an explicit list. Every document is a list.</li>
<li>Never learn words out of context, always in the context of a phrase</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more I wanted to say (this post is based on something I spoke into a voice recorder), but I can&#8217;t be bovvered to type it out, so&#8230;more later <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my personal experience, by far the best bilingual material for someone approaching an L2, is L1 learning materials for L2 speakers. <a class="simple-footnote" title="The one exception is any and every product I make. Har har har." id="return-note-22281-1" href="#note-22281-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
So, in your case, that&#8217;ll be ESL (English as a Second Language) materials for Japanese and Chinese speakers.</p>
<p>Why? Well, because, Grasshopper;</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s always way too much L2 material. ESL books for Japanese people contain more Japanese explanation and commentary than English.</li>
<li>You realize that most grammar explanations are <em>ex post facto</em> realizations of a pattern that is best acquired unconsciously (and can only be realized by someone who has already acquired them unconsciously); you realize that they are unnecessary and almost always succeed in producing fear and confusion rather than comprehension.</li>
<li>The English gives you a massive context cue: you always know what&#8217;s being talked about.</li>
<li>You learn how to discuss the L2 in the L2 &#8212; how to explain words and ideas and grammar and stuff&#8230;with words: the reason this is valuable is because once you can explain words well, you can basically explain anything. Ever notice how accomplished linguists like Stevie Pinker and Noam van den Chomsky range so far outside of linguistics? Yeah, that&#8217;s why.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">The L2 (Japanese/Chinese) is almost always very natural, real, uncondescending, FUNBUN (for native by native). Sometimes there&#8217;s &#8220;translatese&#8221; (Japanese as it sounds translated from English), but this is mmm&#8230;.relatively rare and not to be feared too badly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">It&#8217;s a major confidence boost to realize that Japanese and Chinese L1 speakers are as depressed, brow-beaten, neurotic, erratic and generally sad about their English as you are about your Chinese/Japanese/whatever. And you already know English, so&#8230;you must be awesome in some way.</span></li>
<li>It re-humanizes all people and languages, as you realize it&#8217;s not that Chinese or Japanese is hard (neither is), it&#8217;s just that the method is hard. There are no hard languages, only hard methods. There are no hard steaks, only blunt knives. Think of how ridiculous English spelling is. Yet we&#8217;re not about to change it and nor should we. All that needs changing is how it&#8217;s taught. Similarly, kanji doesn&#8217;t need &#8220;simplifying&#8221; or character reduction or any of that stupidity; the steak doesn&#8217;t need changing, only the knife.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px;">If it doesn&#8217;t suck (i.e. isn&#8217;t a school textbook)</span>, it&#8217;ll often cover very real, idiomatic, English-specific phrases and ideas that you&#8217;re gonna want to know how to express in the L2 anyhow.</li>
<li>Conversely, <strong>if it <em>does</em> suck it&#8217;ll show you just how bad textbooks are and how stilted and unnatural and anachronistic the things they have you learn are.</strong>

<li>People new to Japanese always think I&#8217;m exaggerating about how much JSL textbooks suck until I show them an ESL textbook. If you want to know how bad the Japanese in a typical JSL textbook is, just look at the English in an ESL textbook.</li>
<li>To be fair, not all ESL books that suck are textbooks, but most ESL textbooks, most language textbooks, do suck. I could draw you a Venn diagram, but then I&#8217;d have to upload it and that would be work and we can&#8217;t have that: I think it&#8217;s against my religion. <a class="simple-footnote" title="Just checked.

&#8220;What religion is that, Khatz?&#8221;

I&#8217;d tell ya, but I can&#8217;t be bothered.

&#8220;It sounds to me like you&#8217;re just making it up.&#8221;

Oh yeah, of course, because all the other ones weren&#8217;t made up either.

&#8220;Oh. Oh, zing. Wonders will never cease &#8212; sarcasm on the Internet, Khatz? By Jupiter, your courage knows no bounds.&#8221;

By Jupiter? What, have you been watching Rome again? What is this, Asterix?

&#8220;I put my Ast*rix into your Mom last night&#8230;&#8221;

Yeah, and she said it was soft and floppy, like a French comic book&#8230;

<li>Also, I notice that a lot (though by no means all&#8230;just a lot) of the bilingual examples at the <a href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/">Goo dictionary</a> are &#8220;Englishese&#8221;/translatese &#8212; English-style Japanese &#8212; in that they use <a href="http://amzn.com/156836492X/?tag=ajatt-20">too many personal pronouns</a>, far more than is natural in normal Japanese.

<li>If you don&#8217;t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, and there is plenty of baby at Goo, just ignore any and all (Goo) dictionary examples that contain a personal pronoun &#8212; &#8220;彼&#8221;, &#8220;彼女&#8221;, &#8220;私&#8221;, etc. &#8212; and you should be fine.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 5 of 5 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/fuzake/" class="series-143" title="お巫山戯、日本語で">お巫山戯、日本語で</a></div><p>We here at AJATT usually like to focus on the lighter side of things. But especially around Halloween, there are potential dangers that everyone should be aware of.</p>
<p>Trick-or-treating brings young people out on the streets after dark, leaving them vulnerable to attacks when they least expect it. And we’re not talking about people that kill cats or put razor blades in apples or poison lollipops… No, there is a much more serious threat, a threat that can easily grow to post-apocalyptic proportions if left unchecked…</p>
<p>We are talking, of course, about zombies.</p>
<p>Luckily, at least one successful escape from a would-be flesh eater has been captured on video. A few years ago in Japan, against all odds, a young boy &#8212; with a little bit of help from his sister and younger brother &#8212; saved their family from a zombie attack. As avid horror film enthusiasts, the three children were uniquely prepared with the knowledge and tools they would need. Their valiant fight was recorded by a TV camera crew who just happened to be filming at their home that night.</p>
<p>We present that footage here, in the hope that it can act as a kind of instructional video to help us all prepare for the unthinkable.</p>
<h1> <strong>「ホラー大好き3姉弟、ゾンビ撃退作戦！」</strong> （ほらー・だいすき・さん・してい＝きょうだい、ぞんび・げきたいさくせん！： “3 Horror-Loving Siblings and Their Zombie-Repelling Tactics!”）</h1>
<p><iframe width="860" height="645" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9G2YwAckCro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>The Night That Turned Their World Upside-Down</strong></h2>
<p>It was an evening just like any other evening. The family members were relaxing at home, enjoying wholesome family activities like imitating the crabwalk from the Exorcist—a “special skill” (特技・とくぎ) of the daughter.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden—</p>
<p>外から悲鳴が・・・　（そと　から　ひめい　が・・・）</p>
<p>—shrieks from outside.</p>
<p>The family hurried out to see what was happening, only to find</p>
<p>逃げ惑う近所の人々　（にげまどう　きんじょの　ひとびと）</p>
<p>panicked neighbors running down the street, fleeing from…but it couldn’t be…but yes, yes it was…</p>
<p>ゾンビが来た！ゾンビが来たぞ！皆が好きなゾンビが来たぞ！</p>
<p>（ぞんび　が　きた！　ぞんび　が　きた　ぞ！　みんな　が　すきな　ぞんび　が　きた　ぞ！）</p>
<p>A zombie! In a tragic twist of irony, one of the children’s favorite horror film icons had come to attack their own neighborhood!</p>
<p>The family rushed back into their home, the youngest child, Tomo （友・とも）, overcome with terror:</p>
<p>怖い！（こわい！）</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the worst was still to come. A woman from next door arrived—</p>
<p>近所のオバちゃんがゾンビから預かった手紙</p>
<p>（きんじょの　おばちゃん　が　ぞんび　から　あずかった　てがみ）</p>
<p>—with a letter from the zombie!</p>
<p>なんて書いてある？（なんて　かいてある？）</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it say?&#8221; The children gathered around only to have their worst fears confirmed:</p>
<p>「もうすぐいきます　ゾンビ」</p>
<p>“I’ll be there shortly.    -Zombie”</p>
<p>An announcement of an imminent attack—in chillingly polite Japanese!</p>
<h2><strong>Battle Plans</strong></h2>
<p>戦おう！（たたかおう！）</p>
<p>“Let’s fight!” The reporter rallied the children.</p>
<p>俺（おれ）、やるわ！</p>
<p>“I’ll get him!” cried Tora（虎・とら）, the older brother, waving his toy machine gun by its barrel like a baseball bat.</p>
<p>よーし、やる気（き）になってきた！</p>
<p>&#8220;Atta-boy! All fired up and rarin&#8217; to go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile his older sister Rinko（凛子・りんこ） readied the traps. Pot hung above the door, check. Tape stretched across the bottom of the door frame, check.  And most importantly:</p>
<p>タバスコを配置（はいち）！</p>
<p>Tabasco sauce, CHECK.</p>
<p>３対１や！　（さん　たい　いち　や！）</p>
<p>“It’s 3 against 1!” she piped up with Kansai bravado as they took their stations.</p>
<p>Confidence was running high until…</p>
<p>タバスコ　こぼす！</p>
<p>“You’re gonna tip over the tabasco!” warned the mother. But it was too late. The sauce spilled, unnerving Tora.</p>
<p>But this was no time to cry over spilled tabasco sauce. Thud, thud, thud—heavy footsteps on the stairs!</p>
<h2><strong>The Zombie Arrives!</strong></h2>
<p>来た、来た！頑張って、頑張って！　（きた、きた！がんばって、がんばって！）</p>
<p>“He’s come, he’s come!” whispered the reporter, “Give it all you’ve got!”</p>
<p>Removing his shoes after entering, as Japanese zombies tend to do, the zombie</p>
<p>仕掛けには、全てお付き合いします　（しかけ　には、すべて　おつきあい　します）</p>
<p>obligingly stumbled through all the traps that had been laid. But would it be enough to stop him?!</p>
<p>The door creaked open…Rinko dropped the pot too soon!  In his panic, Tora threw his toy gun at the zombie and had to retreat.</p>
<p>But the next trap was successful! The zombie fell to his knees…</p>
<p>冷たい～　（つめたい～）</p>
<p>“It’s co-old!” He lurched up only to trip once again and plunge head first into the next trap!</p>
<p>With the zombie distracted…</p>
<p>凛子ちゃん、先回りしてサランラップスタンバイ！</p>
<p>（りんこちゃん、さきまわりして　さらんらっぷ　すたんばい！）</p>
<p>Rinko ran ahead into the next room to ready their secret weapon—*SARAN WRAP*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the kitchen—</p>
<p>アレ血、アレ血！　（あれ　ち、あれ　ち！）</p>
<p>—“That’s blood, that’s blood!” Tora bravely guided the zombie toward the “blood” on the floor…</p>
<p>血！？　（ち！？）</p>
<p>“Blood?!” The zombie was all ears.</p>
<p>食べるんやろ！　（たべるんやろ！）</p>
<p>“Try some!”</p>
<p>Tabasco bombs away! His mouth on fire, the enraged zombie turned on the children…</p>
<h2><strong>Backed Into a Corner</strong></h2>
<p>早く、早く！こっち逃げよう！そっち逃げよう！　（はやく、はやく！こっち　にげよう！そっち　にげよう！）</p>
<p>“Hurry, hurry! Run over here! Run over there!”</p>
<p>Flinging projectiles at the zombie, the children backed into the inner room.</p>
<p>来い！　（こい！）</p>
<p>“Bring it!” yelled Tora from the door, holding a toy dinosaur tied to a string above his head.</p>
<p>The zombie lurched closer…only to be struck back by the swinging dinosaur!</p>
<p>死ねよ！絶対死ね！　（しねよ！ぜったいしね！）</p>
<p>“Die! I mean it!!”</p>
<p>もっと来い！もっと来い！早く！もっと来いや！</p>
<p>（もっと　こい！　もっと　こい！　はやく！　もっと　こい　や！）</p>
<p>“C’mon! C’mon! Hurry up! Come back here for some more!” Tora was on fire! He swung the dinosaur one last time into the zombie and shut the door.</p>
<p>みんな、用意、用意！　（みんな、ようい！ようい！）</p>
<p>“Everyone, get ready, get ready!” The children prepared for the final battle as the zombie pounded at the door, but a new conflict was brewing within their own ranks&#8230;</p>
<h2><strong>Breaking Point</strong></h2>
<p>友、何にもしてへんやん、自分　（とも、なんにも　してへんやん、じぶん）</p>
<p>“Tomo, you aren’t doing anything,” the reporter complained as Tomo hid behind a stuffed animal on the bed.</p>
<p>And Rinko, holding the saran wrap ready, was starting to panic,</p>
<p>来て、みんな、お願い！こっち来て！　（きて、みんな、おねがい！こっちきて！）</p>
<p>urging everyone to come closer to the door.</p>
<p>Tora shot back:</p>
<p>噛まれたらどうすんの！？　（かまれたら　どうすんの？！）</p>
<p>&#8220;[Come closer to the door &#8212; great idea!] And what if he bites us[, <em>genius</em>]?!”</p>
<p>グチャグチャにソレ、すんなよ！</p>
<p>“Don’t mess this up!” he barked.</p>
<p>だって、怖いもん！　（だって、こわい　もん！）</p>
<p>“But I’m scared!” she pleaded.</p>
<p>The reporter started telling them they’d need to work together to make it through this, but Tora couldn’t take it anymore…</p>
<p>全然、手伝ってないくせに！何言ってんや！そんなん言わんといて！</p>
<p>（ぜんぜん、てつだってない　くせに！　なに　いってん　や！　そんなん　いわんといて！）</p>
<p>“How can you say that! YOU haven’t been helping us at all! Don’t SAY that!”</p>
<p>俺たち、頑張ってんね！（おれたち、がんばってんね！）</p>
<p>“We’re doing our best!”</p>
<p>He was on the verge of a meltdown, but this boy was not about to back down to a filthy blood licker&#8230;Oh HELL no!</p>
<h2><strong>The Final Battle</strong></h2>
<p>俺が戦ってやる！早く、出て来い！早く！（おれがたたかってやる！はやく、でてこい！はやく！）</p>
<p>“I’m taking you down! Come out here already! NOW!” Tora shouted through his tears.</p>
<p>The zombie staggered in through the door, closer and closer…</p>
<p>食べてやる！　（たべてやる！）</p>
<p>“I’m gonna eat you!” he rasped, and Tora, perched on top a pile of futons, unleashed a hail of blows onto the zombie’s head.  It was time for the…</p>
<p>サランラップ！</p>
<p>“SARAN WRAP!”</p>
<p>Rinko quickly handed it to Tora. Facing down the beast’s deathly jaws, he held up the secret weapon and…</p>
<p>よっしゃあ！</p>
<p>Hyah! Plastered it over the zombies face!</p>
<p>虎、ありがとうな</p>
<p>“Thanks, Tora,” Rinko said as she patted on some more.</p>
<p>The zombie flailed as they wound more and more saran wrap around his head, followed by with a storm of punches and kicks from behind.</p>
<p>The zombie collapsed to the floor and groaned under the relentless assault.</p>
<p>ゾンビさん、大丈夫（だいじょうぶ）ですか！？</p>
<p>“Are you okay, Mr. Zombie?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p>もうこんな家、来ない！　（もう　こんな　いえ、こない！）</p>
<p>“I’ve had it with this place!” whimpered the Zombie as he headed for the door.</p>
<p>来い、もっとオラ！　（こい、もっと　おら！）</p>
<p>“Come here! I’m not done with you yet!” cried Tora, showering the poor zombie with blows （滅多打ち・めったうち）.</p>
<p>But the zombie couldn’t take any more from these crazy kids.</p>
<p>もう二度と来ないよ！　（もう　にど　と　こない　よ！）</p>
<p>“I’m never coming back again!” he wailed as he limped out of the house.</p>
<h2><strong>VICTORY!</strong></h2>
<p>倒したぞ！　（たおした　ぞ！）</p>
<p>“We defeated him!” cried Tora triumphantly, breaking into tears of relief and exhaustion.</p>
<p>みんなが頑張ったから勝ったけど…　（みんな　が　がんばった　から　かった　けど）</p>
<p>“We won ‘cause everybody did their best,” he sobbed into the microphone…</p>
<p>みんな協力して頑張ろうってや　ゆったのに、あのな、協力してなかったな！</p>
<p>（みんな　きょうりょくして　がんばろう　ってや　ゆった　のに、あのな、きょうりょく　してなかった　な！）</p>
<p>“But even though I told everyone to work together, they…they didn’t cooperate!”</p>
<p>でもよかったな　倒れたもんな　（たおれたもんな）</p>
<p>“But it turned out all right! You defeated him!” the reporter pointed out, trying to cheer up Tora, who was now crying into his sleeve.</p>
<p>だれが頑張ったから？　（だれ　が　がんばった　から？）<br />
“And it was all thanks to who?” asked the reporter to the boy who had almost single-handedly saved the day.</p>
<p>みんなが頑張ったから</p>
<p>“Thanks to everyone,” answered Tora, generously.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I’ll leave it to you to decide whether that night will go down as one of the best or worst memories of their childhood, but one thing is for certain—those three little horror fans will never ever forget it.</p>
<p>While nothing can really prepare you for a zombie attack, we hope this footage has shown you how a little bit of tabasco sauce, saran wrap and courage go a long way. And teamwork…if the rest of your family doesn’t chicken out on you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Great comments get left here on <a href="http://AJATT.com" class="autohyperlink">AJATT.com</a>. But, lost in the fog of posts, they tend to get ignored and thus effectively die. <span style="font-style: normal;"><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/category/all-star-comments">All-Star Comments</a></span> is the section where we bring them back to life.</em></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s all-star comment is from <a href="http://nyagonya.xanga.com/">きのこ</a>, an active contributor of back in the recent day. The original post was about <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/on-the-very-serious-subject-of-how-to-have-fun-all-the-time#comments">how to have fun all the time</a>. Here she is in her own words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No sentences I have to type in. No, none, never. If it’s from a book or a movie and I have to pause and type it out, it’s not going to happen. If the word or phrase is that important, I figure I’ll meet it again somewhere more convenient.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Logistics is (are?) a huge dealmaker/breaker. <strong>It&#8217;s not just about doing Japanese, it&#8217;s about making it convenient and doing it in convenient ways</strong>. Maybe not all languages can be treated this way just yet, but with the plethora of electronic materials available in Japanese &#8212; everything from the <a href="http://www.hiraganatimes.com/">Hiragana Times</a> to<a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar"> Tae Kim</a> to <a href="http://ajatt.com/mfsp">MFSP</a> &#8212;  <a href="http://nyagonya.xanga.com/">きのこ</a>&#8216;s is a highly effective, workable and blood pressure-reducing heuristic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, some <em>amazing</em> comments have been left here at AJATT. But they get lost in the fog of posts quite easily. <em>All-Star Comments</em> is a segment where I share the best of the best. Today&#8217;s comment is from a heartbreaker who goes by the monicker &#8220;SRS Addict&#8221;.</p>
<p>The original post was about <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-the-way-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-part-4-why-srs-personal-development-books">using the SRS to remember the best parts of the best examples of personal development literature</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy!</p>
<blockquote><p>SRS Addict said,<br />
November 24, 2009 @ 00:40 · Edit</p>
<p>This is a LONG comment, here it goes:<br />
I find this post very interesting. Here’s why:</p>
<p>About 3 1/2 years ago I began to use the SRS program “<a href="http://www.supermemo.com/">Supermemo</a>” (which I will refer to as “SM”). Since I began using SM, other programs have emerged that specialize in language study, but since I’ve been using SM for so long and have so much time invested in it, it is far too late to think about jumping ship. No doubt the other SRS programs out there work great, so don’t think that I’m knocking them. <strong>In the end, use SOMETHING: it’s better than nothing.</strong></p>
<p>Anyways, <strong>I began to use SM about 3 years ago to retain Japanese vocabulary.</strong> Despite living in America, uncommon words that one does not use very often (such as “<a href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/27958/m0u/%E5%BE%80%E5%BE%A9/">round-trip</a>”) continued to remain in my memory, and it required very little thought to recall them. This feeling of satisfaction was very addictive, and I began to integrate more and more of my intellectual life with Supermemo.</p>
<p><strong>I can now speak, read and write Japanese fluently. </strong>I passed the JLPT 2Q a couple of years ago without even going to Japan. And the reason that I’ve progressed this much has little to do with my abilities (I am really quite average, I think), but I believe that it is purely because Supermemo has helped to augment my abilities and to focus my efforts so that as little time and effort as possible is wasted (at least when that time and effort is being spent on Supermemo). Here is why:</p>
<p><strong>Humans need a variety of food to remain healthy. Similarly, no SINGLE specific method will gain you fluency in a language. </strong>Language study requires a balance of different methods and inputs.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>SM seems to have become my intellectual equivalent of a video game “save point.”</strong> While up until that time, I might have seen/read/heard many interesting or useful things, but until I “save” my intellectual progress, such information only occupies a temporary place in the mind. While SM is not the only thing I use, it is part of my ‘balanced diet.’</p>
<p>I began by putting Japanese sentences into SM, with the word I wanted to memorise written in English (It was easier than trying to describe the word in Japanese). This created context and usage hints. I would usually enter at least two flashcards for each word (like firing multiple bullets to ensure I hit the desired target), thus ensuring that unless I made a big mistake in structing the material (Poor word choice), the algorithms would ensure that I would remember the word in due time (After about a week or two it would stick very well in my mind).</p>
<p>This worked for vocabulary words, so I thought “Would this work for idiomatic expressions, also?” So I began to experiment, and as time went on, when the appropriate time to use such an idiom presented itself, it required as little time as it took to remember a simple vocabulary word. Now it was easy to rack up idioms (As well as 4-character idioms) in my head. Using James Heisig’s Remembering the Kanji volumes one and two (Although I went my own way with book two), I learned all of the ON yomi for the kanji, which made learning most vocabulary words much, much simpler (Most being a combination of two kanji using the ON yomi). In the end learning Japanese simply came down to shooting fish in a barrel, racking up more and more vocabulary that was easily accessable and would be forever retained using SM.</p>
<p>Japanese has now passed on from the “I need to study” phase to the “I speak it fluently” phase. If I were playing World of Warcraft, my Japanese character would be at level 80 (Although I do not play that game, as I want to defend my time from such bandits). I still add Japanese words to SM, but it is like killing low-level monsters at this point, although I would like to eventually take JLPT 1Q, the “final boss.”</p>
<p>But since Japanese is, for all intents and purposes, done, I am moving onto Chinese.<br />
Knowing the kanji has helped out a great deal, and the ON yomi bears a strong enough resemblence to the actual Chinese reading of the character that it is helpful. But each language poses a different set of problems, and I am always experimenting with variations of methods to try to make it a step further in my Chinese progress. Like you mentioned, keeping a foreward thinking, open mind about how to do things helps to ensure progress. Once you find something that works, exploit it until it stops working or you find something better. Currently I’m experimenting with the flashcard format used by the web site “Smart.fm.” I’m trying to impliment it in SM to see if I learn words better than my present flashcard format for Chinese. You might want to give that site a try, if you haven’t already.<br />
We soldier on.</p>
<p>About a year after I began using SM to learn Japanese, I began to expeirment with using SM on non-Japanese desirable knowledge. To learn something FOREVER required such a SMALL investment of time (Less than a minute for the next 30 years of retention). Therefore, one hour of “entertainment-consumption time” could be converted into “self-enrichment through knowledge” time; the long-lasting benefits are so obvious that it makes many other tasks and pursuits seem trivial by comparison (But one must find balance in life, you have to eat some candy every now and then). But rather than simply being a useful study tool, SM has opened up a new way of life for me, where tangible knowledge consumption and retention is well within the grasp of everyone, regardless of anything else. All that is required is a small amount of time and motivation.</p>
<p>As another commenter mentioned above, the process you describe is very similar to incremental reading, a feature advertised on the SM web site. Traditional reading is very much the equivilent of listening to a long speech by someone, and your ‘input’ is limited: Start, stop, or highlight. Incremental reading is basically a process of taking raw electronic reading material, extracting the useful information, and processing for long term retention (Making something into a flashcard is the end-goal of this process). It is the same as digesting food; take food in, extract neutritious parts, get rid of what you don’t need. Since the world has yet to go “fully digital” when it comes to reading material, it seems that we must suffer for a while without having “buy/borrow as a .txt document” as an option for our local libraries or book stores. On the bright side, books are very small compared to mp3s, and music is pirated very often. Therefore, the potential to download books that you buy is very possible, although spotty. For example, I purchased “Atlas Shrugged,” but found that reading it incrementally on SM was more fun than carrying the big book around with me. I was able to find Atlas Shrugged online with little trouble, now I’m currently reading it through SM.</p>
<p>Where traditional reading is more of a lecture, incremental reading is more of an organic dialgue. Granted, the text no longer retains its form, it gets “chopped up” rather quickly (Like clipping out parts of a magazine article that you like), but we want knowledge in our head, not pretty looking words on paper. This philosophy has made me enjoy reading much, much more. (I recommend you read more about incremental reading, it echos the sentiments expressed here. Also, I don’t want to write what has already been written).</p>
<p>But another expriment that I started about a year ago (That I believe conclusively works) was to see if semi-knowledge put into Supermemo could create subtle changes in my personality and thought-process. You mention putting inspirational quotes into Supermemo, and this is pretty much what I did, but I went about it in a different way. Everyone makes decisions based on principles. Someone might see someone else in need, if they are raised as a Christian, they might think “Do unto others…” so they decide to help that person out. Others might operate on a different principle, which would lead to a different action. The question was “could I take those different principles, put them into SM, and just like the idiomatic expressions, when that principle would come into play, would such principles come to mind, and give more options when making decisions?” I believe that the answer is ‘yes.’</p>
<p>For example, one could take key phrases from various philosophy or religious books (That are deemed useful and beneficial by the user, of course), put them into SM, and over time would have such views of the world at their disposal; whether or not they are adopted is up to the user. Therefore you do not have to adopt the philosophy to undersatnd it and have it at your disposal. For example, I have a number of quotes from Hitler in SM because his twisted mind demonstrates a certain cunning and manipulative evil, which it does good to recognize when seen elsewhere (Even in subtle ways).</p>
<p>So basically SM has become a tool with which I program myself. It has grown to encompass my entire life, and has become my primary means of retaining information about the world around me. I spend about one hour using SM every day. Right now I have about 33,000 active flashcards in my big flashcard “deck.”</p></blockquote>

Momoko likes to use language that we don&#8217;t approve of here at AJATT. It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s doing that teenage rebellion thing, but like 15 years too late&#8230;way to be on time, champ. Um&#8230;I actually tried bowdlerizing her text, but then&#8230;yeah, anyway</span><span style="color: #808080;">&#8230;</span></p>
<p><em>This is the fourth (extremely late) installment in a new (ideally) weekly series by Momoko, 「お巫山戯（ふざけ）、日本語で」, or “F***ing around in Japanese”.</em></p>
<p>お待たせ（またせ）！So sorry to keep you waiting for this week&#8217;s お巫山戯. The Khatz and I attended two big wedding parties last week, and, being the grungy T-shirts-lounge-pants-and-sneaker-wearing geeks that we are, it took a LOT of effort and focus and positive pep talks (and bribes from our friends) to get us off our lazy a**es and into formal attire. Anything formal&#8230;is like Kryptonite to us&#8230;but we did it&#8230;and it was actually incredibly fun, and we&#8217;re extremely lucky to have such awesome, patient friends. But, like I said, it took a bit of time and energy so that is why this is so late this week.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to take a short break from my <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/secrets-of-japanese-potty-training-revealed">recent</a> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/whos-afraid-of-the-big-bad-squatty-potty">obsession</a> with potty training (I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;d probably like to give your gag reflex a rest) and turn to something much more&#8230;pretty&#8230;and sparkling and cozy like pink hearts and glitter and fluffy bunnies!! So this week we&#8217;re going to take out our frilly <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3">Lolita</a> umbrellas and frolic around in the magical <a href="http://www.hellokitty.ne.jp/">Hello-Kitty</a>-esque land of&#8230;</p>

<p>Just what exactly is 可愛い（かわいい）? Let me introduce you to some experts on the subject&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Kittens!</strong></p>
<p>This little kitten （子貓／こねこ） is 可愛い&#8230;</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ViRc7jqlz-c&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ViRc7jqlz-c&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>So is this extremely sleepy （眠い／ねむい） one:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DP45Iq-yy0c&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DP45Iq-yy0c&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>And this kitten is SUPER kawaii (超可愛い／ちょうかわいい):</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/sy7Gd_bgJaA&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/sy7Gd_bgJaA&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Awww, ain&#8217;t that <em>precious</em>. 可愛くない（かわいくない）！？ There&#8217;s only one thing more 可愛い than kittens&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>School Girls!</strong></p>
<p>Q: What do you get when you cross 可愛い with 女子高生（じょしこうせい） &#8212; those world-renowned Japanese high school girls in ultra-short-skirted (they really are, even in the winter&#8230;I&#8217;m totally in awe&#8230;no idea how they do it) uniforms?<br />
A: 萌え（もえ）！！</p>
<p>And right now nothing is as 可愛い or 女子高生 or 萌え as the manga/anime series <a href="http://www.lucky-ch.com/">らき☆すた</a> (&#8220;Lucky ☆ Star&#8221; &#8212; Yes, that is an actual star symbol in the middle. Get used to it! We&#8217;re not in Kansas anymore&#8230;)</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m warning you. The intro song, もってけ！セーラーふく (Work that sailor uniform!), is like 可愛い ON STEROIDS. Brace yourself, okay? Here&#8217;s the full/extended version, complete with Japanese lyrics (thank you tanigutanigu!):</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mFSt8CqMj-w&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/mFSt8CqMj-w&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>(You can find copy-and-pasteable lyrics for the whole song <a href="http://uriage.blog48.fc2.com/blog-entry-350.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>I know, I know, I was a bit shell-shocked when I heard that song for the first time, too.</p>
<p>If you want a closer look at what hit you back there, here are the opening lyrics in all their stupefying glory. For the (rough) translation, I relied on the extremely helpful line-by-line explanation provided by a knowledgeable fan <a href="http://ameblo.jp/looklife/entry-10055309750.html">here</a> (助かりました、パトリシア＝マーティンさん！）, the English subtitles from the video clip we&#8217;ll get to in just a minute (thanks gleipnir2!), and Khatz&#8217;s suggestions (ありがとう、ダーリン！　(^з^)-☆):</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like peering into the jaws of madness, no?</p>
<p>Guess what? Most Japanese people feel completely lost, too. Here is just a sampling of the <a href="http://hujita.sakura.ne.jp/log/eid225.html">online comments</a> I came across when I was sweating blood trying to understand and translate the lyrics:</p>
<p>深く（ふかく）考えちゃ（かんがえちゃ）いけない歌詞（かし）だ<br />
<em>These are lyrics you just can&#8217;t think too hard about.</em></p>
<p>深く考えないで　まいっか（＝まあいいか）<br />
<em>Don&#8217;t think too hard about it. F*** it.</em></p>
<p>ぅん!!考えちゃだめだこの歌（うた）は!!聞く（きく）に限る（かぎる）！！<br />
<em>Yeah!! You better not think about this song!! Just listen to it!!</em></p>
<p>And of course, the predictable</p>
<p>萌えーーーーー</p>
<p>from a smitten geek.</p>
<p>I even stumbled upon this hilarious <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/blog_ch/archives/50876364.html">mock-conspiracy-theory &#8220;exposé&#8221;</a> that reveals how the mysterious lyrics encode information about the coming annihilation of humanity （人類滅亡／じん・るい・めつ・ぼう） in World War III （第三次世界大戦／だい・さん・じ・せ・かい・たい・せん）! (It&#8217;s even illustrated like a manga with awesome ASCII art. If you need one reason to learn Japanese, this is it&#8230;)</p>
<p>Why is it so hard for even Japanese people to understand the lyrics? Because under the breezy surface of this cute little song lies a Pandora&#8217;s box chock-full of school girl slang, clever word play and sexual innuendo. Linguistically speaking, this is some dope shi**.</p>
<p>So let us take the advice of our Japanese betters. Just roll with it. (Or invent your own conspiracy theory.) Do NOT try to make it make sense. Just listen. Sing along. To preserve your sanity.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s skip past that really fast part to the chorus&#8230;</p>

<p>And, finally, here for your viewing entertainment and CULTURAL EDIFICATION is the first episode. In the main scene (starting at about 2 minutes into the clip), three of the four main characters &#8212; こなた （「こなちゃん」, the tomboyish one with blue hair), つかさ (the purple-haired one with a bow in her hair; her twin sister, かがみ, has pig tails), and みゆき (the overly polite, pink-haired one with glasses) &#8212; fret over the best ways to eat various pastries: a chocolate-filled cornet （チョココロネ／チョココルネ）; a cream puff （シュークリーム）; a piece of strawberry shortcake （イチゴショート）; a popsicle （アイス）; and a (soft-serve) ice cream cone （ソフトクリーム）. Enjoy:</p>

<p>(Is it just me, or is there something&#8230;a bit &#8220;Freudian&#8221;&#8230;about this scene? But, hey, it could just be me&#8230; I mean, what IS the best way to suck out the creamy contents of various phallic-shaped desserts? These are important philosophical questions!!)</p>
<p>The central question here, as posed by こなた, is which side you should eat the chocolate cornet from:</p>
<p>こなた：　ね、つかさ、チョココロネってどこから食べる（たべる）？</p>
<p>つかさ postulates that you start from the &#8220;head&#8221;:</p>
<p>つかさ：　頭（あたま）からかな。</p>
<p>こなた：　そうっか。</p>
<p>Okay&#8230; So the next logical question would be, which end is the head: the fat one or the thin one?</p>
<p>こなた：　ところでさ、頭ってどっち、太い（ふとい）方（ほう）と細い（ほそい）方（ほう）？</p>
<p>つかさ opts for the thin end:</p>
<p>つかさ：　私（わたし）はこっちの細い方が頭だと思う（おもう）んだけど。</p>
<p>This suprises こなた, who has always thought the fat end was the &#8220;head&#8221;:</p>
<p>こなた：　あっそうか。あたしは太った（ふとった）方（ほう）が頭だと思った（おもった）よ。</p>
<p>When こなた asks つかさ why she takes the former position,</p>
<p>こなた： でも何（なん）で細い方が頭？</p>
<p>つかさ argues that the chocolate cornet looks like a seashell:</p>
<p>つかさ：　だって貝（かい）みたいじゃない？</p>
<p>And when つかさ turns the question back on こなた,</p>
<p>つかさ： こなちゃんは何で太った方？</p>
<p>こなた offers the counter-argument that the cornet looks like a caterpillar (literally, &#8220;potato bug&#8221;),</p>
<p>こなた：　だってさ、芋蟲（いもむし）みたいじゃん。</p>
<p>grossing out つかさ:</p>
<p>つかさ：　えっ！芋蟲！？</p>
<p>Upon which こなた agrees that the seashell model is much more appetizing:</p>
<p>こなた：　まあ、でもそう考える（かんがえる）と貝の方（ほう）がイメージいいね。</p>
<p>This model turns out to be more elegant in theory than in practice, however. When Konata bites the thin end, the chocolate filling squeezes out of the fat end, and she has to keep turning it around to lick the extra chocolate before it falls out.</p>
<p>At which point, the perfectionist Miyuki has to intervene&#8230;</p>
<p>みゆき：　あ、あの・・・<br />
こなた：　ん？</p>
<p>She offers a third, compelling (if perhaps complicated) solution to the problem:</p>
<p>みゆき：　細い方が千切って（ちぎって）、余った（あまった）チョコを付けて(つけて）食べるという食べ方（たべかた）も・・・</p>
<p>You can also break off the thin end and dip it in the extra chocolate (from the fat end)&#8230;</p>
<p>つかさ：　なるほどね！</p>
<p>Eureka! Seems to make sense.</p>
<p>But after a detour into how to eat curry rice （カレーライス）, what condiments to use on what dishes, and different ways of eating egg and meat dishes, Konata realizes</p>
<p>こなた：　あっ。ところで、太い方と細い方、どっちがチョココロネの頭？</p>
<p>she still isn&#8217;t sure which end of the cornet is the &#8220;head&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>So, comrades, let me turn this dilemma over to you: what do YOU think the best way to eat a chocolate cornet is? And which end is the &#8220;head&#8221;?</p>
<p>Next up, the only thing more 可愛い than school girls is:</p>
<p><strong>School Boys!</strong></p>
<p>(to be continued next week&#8230;)</p>

Momoko likes to use language that we don&#8217;t approve of here at AJATT. It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s doing that teenage rebellion thing, but like 15 years too late&#8230;way to be on time, champ. Um&#8230;I actually tried bowdlerizing her text, but&#8230;anyway, yeah&#8230;</span></p>
<p><em>This is the third installment in a new weekly series by Momoko, 「お巫山戯（ふざけ）、日本語で」, or &#8220;F***ing around in Japanese&#8221;. In it, Momoko will document how she&#8230;f***s around in Japanese, with the hope that the links to Japanese media and the irreverent setting will help readers relax a bit, go off on their own as the call of insanity dictates, and screw around in Japanese as well. (And, frankly, since Momoko&#8217;s the kind of uptight perfectionist that needs this sort of thing the most&#8230;it&#8217;s really all for her own benefit anyway.)</em></p>
<p>Last week, you <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/secrets-of-japanese-potty-training-revealed">began your journey into the secrets of Japanese potty training and became a パンツマン</a>: answering the call of the むずむず, practicing おしっこ (while humming the しーぱぱ song) and うんち (while grunting along with the うーんぱぱ song), flushing おしっこ君 and うんち君 bye-bye, and strutting around in those hot J-pants.</p>
<p>Yes, your sit-down style is very good. But patience, grasshopper. You still have much to learn. It is time for you to leave the dojo (道場・どうじょう） and venture out into the wide world of toilet variation!</p>
<p>Your favorite potty-training tiger しまじろう is back with two new magical friends. おしっこバケツ, Pee Bucket, will show you how to use the principle of timing to avoid an embarrassing EMERGENCY. And 和式トイレ, Squatty Potty, will train you in the techniques of the squat style practiced all over Asia and popular in public restrooms in Japan.</p>
<p>Listen to these skilled masters, and 「どんなトイレも　へっちゃらちゃ！」 &#8212; any toilet will be a piece of cake!:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FIqP8vA6l50&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FIqP8vA6l50&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t that *special*?</p>
<p>Now stretch your quads and grab those training pants. It&#8217;s time for another potty training adventure!</p>
<p><strong>おしっこバケツ！: Pee Bucket!</strong></p>
<p>わーい！</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Boy, are you excited! You skip through the doors of the huge <a href="http://www.yodobashi-akiba.com/info/index.html">ヨドバシカメラ</a> electronics mega-store in <a href="http://www.akiba.or.jp/">秋葉原</a>（あきはばら）. You start making a bee-line for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/jp/ipad/">i-Pad</a> display when</p>
<p>(Your name)？ トイレは？</p>
<p>Your momma tries to talk some sense into you: Boy/Girl, check yo self! You need to go?</p>
<p>うーん･･･</p>
<p>Mmmm&#8230; You look down at your &#8220;tummy&#8221;, listening for the むずむず&#8217;s, but instead &#8212; boom! Out pops a&#8230;bucket?</p>
<p>僕(ぼく） (your name) のおしっこバケツ！</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your pee bucket!&#8221; he gleefully announces.</p>
<p>Just how many freaks you got living in there, mate? Your &#8220;pee bucket&#8221;, huh&#8230; The only thing that would make this any weirder would be if he started&#8230;dancing&#8230;and singing&#8230;oh lard here it comes:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>おしっこしよう！　♪</td>
<td>Let’s go pee-pee!</td>

<tr>
<td>ゴー　ゴー！　♪</td>

<td>Let’s go pee-pee!</td>

<tr>
<td>おしっこ　いっぱい　なるまえ（前）に　♪</td>
<td>Before your bladder gets full</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>(lit. Before the pee fills up)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Despite this catchy motivational song, complete with a go-go pee drops chorus, you blow off his advice, you little punk:</p>
<p>やっぱりまだいいや。</p>
<p>Meh, I&#8217;m ok for now.</p>
<p>But the pee-pee bucket is already hopping side to side, doing the potty-dance:</p>
<p>(Your name)！ おしっこどんどん溜まって（たまって）きたよ！</p>
<p>Yo! This pee is filling up like mad, son!</p>
<p>トイレ行く（いく）よ！</p>
<p>Get your a** to a toilet!</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, you&#8217;re getting a butt massage in one of the deluxe massage chairs, giggling like a fool, when all of a sudden&#8230;</p>
<p>おっ！</p>
<p>*Gasp!* You grab your pee-bucket region &#8212;</p>
<p>あー・・・</p>
<p>Uh-oh&#8230;</p>
<p>おしっこバケツ is frantic now &#8212; he can hardly hold it in:</p>
<p>(Your name)！ おしっこ漏れちゃう（もれちゃう）よ！</p>
<p>Dude! I&#8217;m gonna EXPLODE (lit. The pee&#8217;s gonna leak out)!!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re running like crazy&#8211;</p>
<p>お母（かあ）さん！ トイレ！</p>
<p>Mommy! I gotts ta GO!!</p>
<p>お母さん&#8217;s shaking her head&#8230;</p>
<p>やっぱり！ さっき行って（いって）おけばよかったでしょう？</p>
<p>I knew it! Ya shoulda gone before, doncha know!</p>
<p>There you are doing a tap dance, struggling with your zipper in front of the first ceramic basin you lay eyes on&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re freaking out:</p>
<p>あー　漏れちゃう！</p>
<p>(*&amp;$%@! I&#8217;m gonna pee my pants!!)</p>
<p>Your pee bucket&#8217;s freaking out:</p>
<p>早く（はやく）、早く！！</p>
<p>(Move it muddaf***ah!!!)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the freaking end of the world&#8230;</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>あ～　間に合った！</p>
<p>Whew! Just in time! You lucky son-of-a-tiger!</p>
<p>Your empty pee bucket breathes a sigh of relief:</p>
<p>フー！</p>
<p>And shows you the back of his hand&#8230;well he <em>should</em>&#8230;but being a gentleman of honor, he raises his pointing finger (ここがポイント！&#8211; Here comes an important point!) instead and cheerfully reminds you:</p>
<p>（Your name)、もうぎりぎりは嫌（いや）だよ！</p>
<p>Don’t EVER just-in-time me again! You hold it in one more time and I will internally <em>wound</em> you!</p>
<p>おしっこがいっぱいになる前（まえ）に、トイレに行ってね！</p>
<p>So go potty before your bladder gets full, mkay?</p>
<p>But before his sage advice can sink in&#8230;</p>
<p>お！</p>
<p>Uh-oh&#8230; There&#8217;s that むずむず tickle in your butt again! And you know what that means&#8230;</p>
<p>あー　うんちかな？</p>
<p>Umm&#8230; I think I need to poo!</p>
<p>You look around the public restroom and&#8230;wait, what is THAT&#8230;that long ceramic hole in the ground?!!</p>
<p><strong>和式トイレ！: Squatty Potty!</strong></p>
<p>You start to panic&#8230;</p>
<p>どうしよう！ うちのトイレと違う（ちがう）。</p>
<p>Oh crap! It&#8217;s different from my potty at home!</p>
<p>And crap is exactly what you&#8217;ve got to do&#8230; But how?! Your usual パンツマン confidence is shriveling up&#8230;</p>
<p>But then&#8230;oh my magic sparkles?!&#8230;the squatty potty comes to life all fired-up with positive can-do gumption:</p>
<p>大丈夫！</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry you&#8217;re pretty little head!</p>
<p>僕と一緒（いっしょ）にやってみよう！</p>
<p>We can do it together!!</p>
<p>You blink your eyes, a little stunned &#8212;</p>
<p>おっ</p>
<p>Now hold on to your J-pants&#8230;I can feel another song coming on&#8230;</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>わしき（和式）トイレも　♪</td>
<td>Squatty potty (lit. Japanese-style toilet)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ゴー　ゴー！　♪</td>
<td>Go! Go!</td>

<td>わしき（和式）トイレも　♪</td>
<td>Squatty potty</td>

<tr>
<td>ゴー　ゴー！　♪</td>
<td>Go! Go!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ちゃんと　できる（出來る）よ　♪</td>
<td>You can use it too</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>へっちゃらちゃ！　♪</td>
<td>Smooth as butta baby!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then the toilet-paper dispenser whisks you off-screen as your underwear and shorts fly off of you&#8230;in a totally&#8230;non-creepy way&#8230;</p>
<p>And then Squatty Potty gives you your first instruction&#8230;</p>
<p>それじゃ、僕を跨いで（またいで）！</p>
<p>Ok, straddle me!</p>
<p>&#8230;Whoa! Ok, that&#8217;s it! You give potty mouth and his pervy sidekick a hard kick where it counts and&#8230; Wait! No!! It&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking! He&#8217;s a <em>squatty potty</em> &#8212; what&#8217;s he supposed to say?! Drop those pants? Spread &#8217;em? Now for a shower of golden proportions??&#8230;</p>
<p>Hehe&#8230; *Happy thoughts, happy thoughts*</p>
<p>うん。</p>
<p>Ok. *Gulp*</p>
<p>You turn around so your butt is pointing at the squatty potty&#8217;s head, and he&#8217;s like, whoa there buddy&#8230;</p>
<p>ううん、そっちじゃなくて</p>
<p>No, no, not like that&#8230;</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re all</p>
<p>え？</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>(&#8230;and now Momoko realizes she&#8217;s been doing it wrong all these years&#8230;&amp;$%#@!&#8230;)</p>
<p>Now let Squatty break it down for you with another song:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>こっちが　まえ（前）！　こっちが　まえ（前）！　♪</td>
<td>Face this way! Face this way!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>またいで（跨いで）　パッ！　♪</td>
<td>And boom! Straddle it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>パッ！　♪</td>
<td>Boom!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>そのまま　ゆっくり　しゃがむ（蹲む）よ　♪</td>
<td>Then slowly squat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>おしり（お尻）が　さがる（下がる）　♪</td>
<td>Lower your bum&#8230;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Lower&#8230; lower&#8230; lower&#8230; (Watch you&#8217;re balance! you do NOT want to fall down right now&#8230;)</p>
<p>*Drum roll*</p>
<p>ストップ！</p>
<p>Stop!</p>
<p>準備（じゅんび）オッケー？</p>
<p>All ready?</p>
<p>Yep! All set! Now it&#8217;s your time to shine!</p>
<p>うーん うーん</p>
<p>A couple of grunts, and&#8230; *Bombs Away!* &#8230;a juicy little poo pops out!</p>
<p>出た（でた）！</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s out! OMG! You did it!!</p>
<p>ぱぱぱらっぱっぱっぱー ♪</p>
<p>*Trumpets!*</p>
<p>わーい！</p>
<p>Woo HOO! Yeah! Look who&#8217;s squatting now!</p>
<p>*Clap* *Clap* *Clap* Impressive. Now, young パンツマン, you are trained in the styles of both East and West. You have entered the narrow gate to deep cultural understanding. Soon you will be unstoppable!</p>
<p>もうどんなトイレもへっちゃらちゃ！</p>
<p>Now any toilet will be へっちゃらちゃ!</p>
<p><strong>Oh yeah, one more thing&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Now, ladies, if you have a hard time grunting like しまじろう in public&#8230;or farting&#8230;or even making the tiniest pee tinkle, you are in LUCK because the public restrooms for women in Japan are equipped with one of the most exciting, revolutionary technologies to grace this age &#8212; the&#8230;</p>
<div>☆*･゜ﾟ･*:.｡..｡.:*･゜☆○o。<a href="http://www.excite.co.jp/News/bit/00091141883411.html"><span style="font-size: x-large;">音姫</span></a>。o○☆ﾟ･*:.｡. .｡.:*･゜ﾟ･*☆</div>
<p>（おとひめ） or &#8220;Sound Princess&#8221;! It&#8217;s a handy little device on the wall next to the toilet, and when you wave your hand like a beauty queen in front of the sensor, it continuously loops a flushing sound like a sparkling mountain stream so that the business that goes on in your stall, stays in your stall.</p>
<p>Check this baby out:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/-JRG8I0GvL4&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/-JRG8I0GvL4&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>Classy, innit? This is, apparently, one of the <a href="http://bizmakoto.jp/bizid/articles/0907/30/news047.html">carefully guarded secrets</a> Japanese women have been keeping from Japanese men. So sorry guys&#8230; I guess you&#8217;ll have write a few petitions&#8230;make a few posters&#8230;go on a few strikes if you want to get some of this action. (Or go in drag&#8230; But that&#8217;s a お巫山戯 for another week&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8216;Til next time, happy squatting!</p>

Um&#8230;I actually tried bowdlerizing her text, but&#8230;anyway, yeah&#8230;</span></p>
<p><em>This is the second installment in a new weekly series by Momoko, 「お巫山戯（ふざけ）、日本語で」, or &#8220;F***ing around in Japanese&#8221;. In it, Momoko will document how she&#8230;f***s around in Japanese, with the hope that the links to Japanese media and the irreverent setting will help readers relax a bit, go off on their own as the call of insanity dictates, and screw around in Japanese as well. (And, frankly, since Momoko&#8217;s the kind of uptight perfectionist that needs this sort of thing the most&#8230;it&#8217;s really all for her own benefit anyway.)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/japanese-babies-that-suck-even-harder-than-you">Last week</a> we went head-to-head with a round-up of Japanese babies and found that, despite all their cuteness, those ちび&#8217;s got nothing on us Japanese-wise.</p>
<p>Once those little two-and-a-half-year-old&#8217;s who can&#8217;t remember the names of colors or what they ate for lunch pass their third birthday, however, it&#8217;s a different story. Suddenly you&#8217;ve got an entitled motor-mouth bossing you around and trying to explain these long, convoluted stories as you desperately nod your incomprehensive face and hope she won&#8217;t be able to tell she lost you 10 minutes back after the first breathless あのね、･･･ .</p>
<p>Yes, those three-year-old&#8217;s have something&#8230;special.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought about this phenomenon long and hard, and as I see it, the one thing these kids got that we don&#8217;t got is the super-secret coming-of-age rite each Japanese child is initiated into just before they turn three: 排泄訓練（はいせつくんれん）, or potty-training&#8230;in Japanese. I mean, where else would they get that gloating air of self-satisfaction, that preternatural confidence and poise?</p>
<p>Not potty-trained in Japanese yet? NO PROBLEM. Today, my friend, you are going to earn your very own pair of J-pants and become a パンパン・パンツマン! With the help of a singing family of tigers! Yeah!</p>
<p>I know, I know, you&#8217;re practically peeing your pants with excitement&#8230; Just hold that thought&#8230;just a little longer until you <em>know what to do</em>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll receive our basic training from the infamous classic　「トイレで できたら パンツマン」 (Use-the-Potty Pantsman/ If you can use the potty, you&#8217;re a pantsman!). Just click on the screen below and しまじろう （縞次郎 &#8211; &#8220;Stripey&#8221;) and his friends おしっこ君 (Mr. Pee) and うんち君 (Mr. Poo) will hook-you-up （there&#8217;s even a peek at some wicked しまじろう potty-training gear at the end):</p>

<p>This is a lot of information to take in at once, <em>I know</em>. So let&#8217;s take it step-by-step and do a little image training, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>おしっこだ！: Going #1</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so you&#8217;re sitting there, doing your kanji reps (プップー), gulping down your favorite sugary yogurt drink <a href="http://www.nissinyork.co.jp/pilkulcorner/pilkul/index.html">ピルクル</a>, when all of a sudden you get this weird, prickly sensation down in your&#8230; &#8220;stomach&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>おっ！お腹（なか）がむずむずする！</p>
<p>you exclaim, wondering what on earth it could mean&#8230;</p>
<p>Then the cloying jiminy-cricket-like voice of Mama Tiger pops into your head and chimes in:</p>
<p>むずむずした時（とき）、なーん（何）だ？</p>
<p>What does it mean when your tummy goes むずむず? What indeed&#8230; You concentrate really hard, and</p>
<p>むずむず！むずむず！</p>
<p>a tear-drop-shaped gremlin starts jumping up and down all up inside of you, tickling you in strange places, making you think of&#8230;Niagara falls&#8230;*that&#8217;s right, the tear-drop-shaped gremlin means&#8230;*</p>
<p>おしっこだ！</p>
<p>Pee-pee!! Yesss!! <em>I&#8217;ve got this one!</em></p>
<p>僕（ぼく）トイレ！</p>
<p>(or if you&#8217;re of the female persuasion)</p>
<p>私（わたし）トイレ！</p>
<p>I gotta go!</p>
<p>You scamper off to the toilet and, lo and behold, it greets you <em>in Japanese</em>:</p>
<p>やあ、(your name)！</p>
<p>and you&#8217;re like, ohmygosh I gotta <em>pee</em>,</p>
<p>僕／私 おしっこなの。</p>
<p>And then in a totally platonic, non-creepy way, the magical talking toilet tells you to come sit on its lap&#8230;</p>
<p>よーし、僕に座って（すわって）。</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re all</p>
<p>うん！</p>
<p>Yeah! Let&#8217;s <em>do</em> this!</p>
<p>Then in the back of your mind, it&#8217;s as if you can hear a million AJATTeer voices all around you, encouraging you on:</p>
<p>(Your name)、一緒（いっしょ）に頑張ろう（がんばろう）！</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do this together!</p>
<p>You clench both fists with a look of grim determination like, I&#8217;m going to do this pee-pee or go down trying, and</p>
<p>うん！</p>
<p>you give a firm nod&#8230;<em>it&#8217;s pee-pee song time</em>.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">

<p>Hmm&#8230;so catchy&#8230;しーぱっぱ&#8230; Before you know it,</p>
<p>やほー！</p>
<p>Cowabunga!!! おしっこ君 magically water-slides out of you and into the toilet, laughing hysterically like he&#8217;s having <em>the time of his life</em> !</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re all, OMG! The pee-pee came out!</p>
<p>おしっこ出た（でた）！</p>
<p>And the crowd goes wild:</p>
<p>わーい！やった！やった！</p>
<p>Woohoo! You did it!! Look at you all grown up and peeing in Japanese! Yeah!!</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to say good-bye to Mr. Pee as you flush him down to a better place:</p>
<p>おしっこ君（くん）、バイバイ！</p>
<p>As you triumphantly wash your hands, your imaginary tiger mother heaps on the praise:</p>
<p>トイレでおしっこ出來た（できた）わね！</p>
<p>You did a pee-pee on the toilet, doncha know!</p>
<p>うん！</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right bee-atch! This little cub&#8217;s going places!</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re half-way to those coveted panties. Just one more Rubicon to cross&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>僕うんち！: Going #2</strong></p>
<p>So you&#8217;re snacking away on <a href="http://pocky.jp/index.html">ポッキー</a> sticks and popcorn, watching your favorite Japanese drama. It&#8217;s just getting to the good part when all of a sudden&#8230;</p>
<p>あれ？　お尻（しり）がむずむずする！</p>
<p>What the? It&#8217;s that むずむず feeling again, but this time <em>in your butt</em>!!</p>
<p>Here comes that jiminy-cricket voice again, but this time in the paternal bass of Papa Tiger&#8230;</p>
<p>むずむずした時、なーんだ？</p>
<p>What could it be? Irritable bowel syndrome? Think, think, think&#8230;</p>
<p>むずむず！むずむず！</p>
<p>Woah, there&#8217;s another gremlin bouncing up and down inside your nether-regions! But this time it looks like a little brown blob&#8230;kind of like&#8230;oh ye-eah&#8230;</p>
<p>僕／私 うんち！</p>
<p>I gotta poo!!</p>
<p>トイレに行く（いく）！</p>
<p>To the toilet-mobile!</p>
<p>Your trusty toilet is waiting and ready for action:</p>
<p>よーし！うんちも頑張って（がんばって）みよう！</p>
<p>Righty-o! Let&#8217;s give this poo-thing a try!</p>
<p>うん！</p>
<p>All right! You&#8217;re all psyched up, you get into position, and it&#8217;s time for the poo-poo song:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="5">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>うんち　出る出る（でるでる）　♪</td>

<p>One more squeeze and &#8230;</p>
<p>わーい！</p>
<p>Weeee! Out pops うんち君! What a happy little sh**!</p>
<p>うんち出た！</p>
<p>The うんち is out! You <em>did</em> it!</p>
<p>やったね、(your name)！</p>
<p>It&#8217;s party time! A magical ball bursts open, trumpets play, and all this confetti floats down! It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re a hero in a ticker-tape parade!</p>
<p>Now bend over and wipe that a**&#8230;</p>
<p>お尻を拭いて（ふいて）</p>
<p>&#8230;and say good-bye to the giggling little turd as he swirls down the hole!</p>
<p>うんち君、バイバイ！</p>
<p>Whew, doesn&#8217;t that feel <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>あ～　すっきりした！</p>
<p>Fresh as a daisy!</p>
<p>Wow, you can&#8217;t believe it&#8230; Won&#8217;t your tiger dad be proud!</p>
<p>お父さん（おとうさん）、僕／私 トイレでうんち出來たね！</p>
<p>Daddy, daddy, I did a brown poopee on the toilet, didn&#8217;t I!!!</p>
<p>うん！すごいぞ！</p>
<p>You sure did, little trouper! Way to go!</p>
<p><strong>パンパン･パンツマンだ！: Look ｗho&#8217;s a pantsman now!</strong></p>
<p>And now *ahem* <em>it is time</em> for the donning of the sacred pants:</p>
<p>今日（きょう）から（your name）も･･･パンパン・パンツマンだ！！！</p>
<p>From this day henceforth, you too shall be known as a&#8230;</p>
<p>*Dah duh-duh DAH!*</p>
<p>&#8230;pan-pan-PANTSMAN!!!</p>
<p>OMG!!! Look at those spanking new J-pants! Sparkling like a million suns! Go ahead, try &#8217;em on&#8230; Yeah, you like that?</p>
<p>パンツで気持ち（きもち）いい！</p>
<p>You bet they feel good! That&#8217;s the feeling of POWER! You&#8217;re not a Japanese baby anymore, son &#8212; now you&#8217;re a full-fledged member of the J-Pants Big People Society.</p>
<p>Yeah, go on, give those knickers a good smack!</p>
<p>パンパン　パンツマン！</p>
<p>Now, we must <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZLYQqnhzs">protect&#8230;this&#8230;house</a>!</p>
<p>*パンパン　パン　パンパン　パン*</p>
<p>Who will protect this ho-ouse?</p>
<p>I will, I will!</p>
<p>Will you protect this ho-ouse?</p>
<p>I will, I will!</p>
<p>We must protect this house!</p>
<p>I will I will!!</p>
<p>J-PANTS!!!</p>
<p>Aaaah! すっきりした！Can you feel it?! That new-found pride and sense of accomplishment?</p>
<p>If you’re still feeling a bit lost, don’t worry! We’ll be practicing a lot more in coming installments. You’ll learn how to handle any situation &#8212; Japanese-style toilets, running out of toilet paper, having to go pee and poo <em>at the same time</em>, constipation…</p>
<p>By the end of this month, you will have *mastered* this subtle Japanese art. You, too, can be a パンパン　パンツマン!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 1 of 5 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/fuzake/" class="series-143" title="お巫山戯、日本語で">お巫山戯、日本語で</a></div><p><span style="color: #808080;">Note from Dear Leader Khatzumoto: The following post is by Momoko, and not me. Momoko likes to use language that we don&#8217;t approve of here at AJATT. It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s doing that teenage rebellion thing, but like 15 years too late&#8230;way to be on time, champ. Um&#8230;I actually tried bowdlerizing her text, but&#8230;anyway, yeah&#8230;</span></p>
<p><em>This is the first installment in a new weekly series by Momoko, 「お巫山戯（ふざけ）、日本語で」, or &#8220;F***ing around in Japanese&#8221;. In it, Momoko will document how she&#8230;f***s around in Japanese, with the hope that the links to Japanese media and the irreverent setting will help readers relax a bit, go off on their own as the call of insanity dictates, and screw around in Japanese as well. (And, frankly, since Momoko&#8217;s the kind of uptight perfectionist that needs this sort of thing the most&#8230;it&#8217;s really all for her own benefit anyway.)</em></p>
<p>I have to admit, one of the most humiliating parts of learning a language is <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/cute-girls-mathematics-language">when you realize that even three-year-olds put you to shame</a>—after months or even years of trying to learn the blasted thing. When I go to a Japanese friend’s house and listen to their little ちびちゃん babbling away, my internal monologue usually goes something like this: #@$&amp;*! What&#8217;s the word for dinosaur again? hide-and-go-seek? elbow? pee-pee? Sh**! Sh**! Sh**!!! Why don’t I <em>know</em> this stuff?! That snot face is totally owning me!</p>
<p>But fear not, comrades. I&#8217;ve got just the thing for our wounded egos. Maybe you suck at Japanese, but there&#8217;s no WAY you suck as hard as these <del datetime="2010-04-09T10:08:36+00:00">slobbering cretins</del> precious bundles of joy. (Or you won’t in about 2 minutes after reading this.)</p>
<p>I give you: Japanese babies that suck. Even harder than you.</p>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s start with &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Counting!</strong></p>
<p>The title of our first video translates &#8220;A baby who can count&#8221;. See what <em>you</em> think&#8230;</p>
<p><object width="560" height="340" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/FLH8YNeBSFo&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="560" height="340" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/FLH8YNeBSFo&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>「數字を數える赤ちゃん」? I don&#8217;t think so! You can&#8217;t just make the same incoherent sound whenever your mom pauses and call that counting. That’s いち、に、さん fool!!</p>
<p>This next baby got <em>one</em> number right&#8230;</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/36yACMOysrg&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/36yACMOysrg&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>&#8230;and consistently forgot all the nine ones that came before it! Nice. Again, that&#8217;s いち、に、<em>さん</em>, not いち、に、<em>じゃ～ん</em>. You just can&#8217;t make this stuff up&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, folks, but if his parents can claim he can count after <em>that</em>, where, I guess 「數」 is &#8220;number&#8221; instead of &#8220;numbers&#8221;, then we all know Japanese. I mean, you know &#8220;sushi&#8221;, right?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move on to</p>
<p><strong>Colors!</strong></p>
<p>Our next little ちび is either color blind or suffers from severe short-term memory loss. You decide:</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8xXyDF0Y7IM&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8xXyDF0Y7IM&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>That&#8217;s ピンク、あお、あか bee-atch!</p>
<p>Aww&#8230; But let&#8217;s give her another chance. In this second attempt, she starts out strong&#8230;</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8CYqVetLwa4&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8CYqVetLwa4&amp;hl=ja_JP&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>&#8230;and sharply nose-dives into a long stream of gobbledygook.</p>

<p><strong>Food!</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What did you eat?&#8221; A question so simple, even a two-and-a-half-year-old who had just eaten a pear and is still sitting at the table wearing her bib could answer it, no problem, right? Right?</p>

<p>I love it! First her dad fakes her out: もも（桃）？</p>
<p>She takes the bait: Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s it, I had a peach&#8230;</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s like: Unh-unhh <em>*you had a pear, baby!!*</em></p>
<p>And she&#8217;s like: Uh, yeah! なし（梨）！</p>
<p>Lol, and then he&#8217;s like: Was it good?</p>
<p>And then she looks over at her mom for a hint, like she can&#8217;t remember: Ummmm&#8230;ye-eah&#8230;</p>
<p>Her mom checks: So what did you eat again?</p>
<p>Baby: A pear! A pear, ok, A PEAR!</p>
<p>And she slaps the table like, Yeah! I know what I eat!</p>
<p>&#8230; (Two seconds later) &#8230;</p>
<p>Dad, playing dumb: I can&#8217;t remember anymore&#8230;what did you eat?</p>
<p>Baby: ええと・・・わすれちゃったぁ！</p>
<p>She forgot?!! Again? After two seconds? Is this baby for real?!</p>
<p>Dad tries to trip her up again: もも？</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not going for it this time&#8230; She&#8217;s smarter than that!</p>
<p>And here comes the icing on the cake&#8230; Wait for it&#8230;</p>
<p>Baby: し・・・しか（鹿）？</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, folks, <em>deer</em>. As in Bambi.<br />
She had a pea&#8230;DEER.</p>
<p>Sweet Jeebus, this baby&#8217;s gone crazy! Watch out, daddy! She&#8217;s gonna eat you next before she remembers that stupid piece of fruit!</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230; Now let&#8217;s see&#8230; What did *I* eat　today?</p>
<p>1. 林檎（りんご）<br />
2. サンド<br />
3. カレーライス<br />
4. サラダ<br />
5. バナナ<br />
6. ジュース&#8230; Oh yeah and some<br />
7. チップス</p>
<p>Piece. Of. ケーキ.</p>
<p>As for the rest of you, I know you hippies. You had sushi didn&#8217;t you?! Don&#8217;t worry, sushi （鮨／壽司） counts. And beer （ビール）. Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, *green tea* (お茶（ちゃ））. Hippies.</p>
<p><strong>Final Score</strong></p>
<p>Babies: 0<br />
Us: 5</p>
<p>Aaaaaahhhhhh. Can you <em>smell</em> that? That&#8217;s the sweet fragrance of <em>pure ownage</em>.</p>
<p>Savor it, friends, savor it.</p>
<p><strong>Alright, Enough Trash-talking Japanese Babies Already</strong></p>
<p>Um, I’ve said a lot of nasty things here about uh&#8230; defenseless babies that I’m not too proud of, things I didn’t mean… I’d like to take a moment to publicly apologize to these babies and their parents and thank them for graciously giving us a peek into their private lives. I mean, seriously, those are some <em>cute</em> kids. ＼(-_-*)　反省！！</p>
<p>It’s obviously unfair for an uncouth, callous American brat like me to pick apart these babies&#8217; skills when they’re still just developing. But my point in doing so, aside from just being an immature jacka**, is to remind us that it’s just as outrageous when we put ourselves down—the Japanese babies inside of us—with ridiculous adult-level expectations.</p>
<p>We need to nurture our own awkward growth with the same patience, encouragement, and relaxed sense of humor these parents show toward their children. They never question that their endearingly forgetful, often incoherent babies will grow into fluent, literate members of Japanese society as sure as the sun rises in the morning. And why should they? Living things grow the way they&#8217;re fed.</p>
<p>So as much as you may seem to suck now, don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. Make sure you baby your Japanese baby everyday.</p>
<p>Now for those pesky three-year-olds&#8230;　さあ　來い！</p>
<p><em><strong>Note of acknowledgment</strong>.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just by way of sharing concrete tactics (rather than, I guess, the abstract strategy I usually share (?)), I thought I’d write about how I learn songs using the SRS.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is just what I do right now. Yes, I am the Great Khatzumoto, but you know what? Really I’m just a 27-year-old boy who drinks peppermint tea and plays with his cats. I don’t know jack about jack. This is just what was most fun and least annoying for me. You’re bound to have a better idea and I’d love to hear about it if you’d like to share <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>Put another way: a lot of AJATT strategic principles are universal, I think. But the tactical stuff is totally a matter of “what works for you”. I mean, we might not even be running the same OS, so…you know. Anyway, here we go!</p>
<h1>The Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li>Have a song that you love, love, love and wish you could sing along to</li>
<li>If at any point in this process you get bored…stop. The worst thing you could do for your Chinese/Japanese/any language is start to associate it with boredom. That there is the gateway to failure. Having fun with and in the language is the name of the game.</li>
<li>Get an mp3 file of the song.</li>
<li>Split the file into 10~30-second clips with ~5 seconds of backward overlap
<ul>
<li>I add a 5-second backward overlap because a split on strict time boundaries is bound to be imperfect in that it’ll cut right in the middle of something good.
<ul>
<li>Adding the overlap provides a way to automatically compensate for this without going through the psychological and computational heck of attempting to split on something like silence-points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I use EZSoftMagic’s <a href="http://www.ezsoftmagic.com/mp3splitter_joiner.htm">MP3 Splitter &amp; Joiner</a> for this automated splitting
<ul>
<li>They’re not paying me for this endorsement, but they should <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
<li>If you know of any other software that does a good job at this, feel free to share in comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The reason we split the file and not just throw the whole thing into the SRS is because we are trying to do what the SRS does best – <strong>optimize the management and memorization of discrete chunks of information</strong>. Throwing the entire song in there is (1) boring and (2) defeats the purpose of even having an SRS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get the lyrics of the song</li>
<li>Put the audio clip into the SRS on the <strong>back</strong> of the card</li>
<li>Put <strong>one line</strong> or less of the lyrics on the <strong>front</strong> of the card
<ul>
<li>i.e. the lyrics of a segment of the 10~30-second clip, not of the whole clip</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put the lyrics of the whole 10~30-second clip, or of the entire song, on the <strong>back</strong> of the card.
<ul>
<li>I prefer putting the lyrics of just the whole clip because it’s easier to read</li>
<li>But sticking the lyrics of the entire song on the back could save you a lot of fiddling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do your reps.
<ul>
<li>The task is to read aloud or sing the line/segment of the line of the song</li>
<li>Check your “answer” against the actual song clip</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Final note: if any of this feels like too much work, then stop. Abort. Delete. Whatever. Because you obviously don&#8217;t like the song enough. You may like the song, just not <em>enough</em>, not <em>that much</em>. And that&#8217;s fine. Remember, the idea is to<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/on-the-very-serious-subject-of-how-to-have-fun-all-the-time" target="_blank"> be like Soviet Russia: <strong>let the media motivate <em>you</em></strong> &#8212; that&#8217;s its job.  <strong>All you have to do is put yourself in the path of the media</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>Sample Card</strong></h1>
<p>FRONT</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">男兒當自強</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_hCJMVaAk&amp;feature=channel_page" target="_blank">Youtube</a>]
<p>BACK</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">[<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data/naam-yi-dong-ji-keung-007.mp3">media: naam yi dong ji keung- 007.mp3</a>]
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">廣闊浩氣揚　既是男兒當自強 昂步挺胸</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">jìshì【既是】<br />
…であるからには．…である以上．</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">gei si naam yi dong ji keung</p>
<h1><strong>Benefits of this method</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Over time, with very little effort, you learn the entire song</li>
<li>As per SRS principles, the parts of the song that give you the most trouble – and that therefore need the most practice – will get seen the most
<ul>
<li>Ever notice how almost everyone knows the chorus of a song no matter how complex the vocabulary? (I remember being about 6 years old and singing Bobby Brown’s “it’s my prerogative!”). That’s because the chorus gets repeated so much. <strong>SRSing the song </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">turns the entire song into a “chorus”</span></strong>, in that all the parts of the song will get repeated to the degree necessary to ensure their memorization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No need to fiddle with carrying lyric sheets in your bag or on your computer – it’s not like you can ever get them out on time anyway.</li>
<li>Even after the song stops getting playtime on your mp3 player, the SRS will ensure that you keep getting practice with it. This is a microcosm of how the SRS is a powerful partner to an immersion environment – even after you stop immersing in, say, technical documents from a certain field, the SRS will guarantee you keep getting the practice in that field that you need to retain your proficiency in it.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 10 of 11 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/secrets-to-smoother-srsing/" class="series-139" title="Secrets to Smoother SRSing">Secrets to Smoother SRSing</a></div><p>In arithmetic, whenever we have an expression, we don&#8217;t just go left-to-right, and we don&#8217;t just run our calculations all willy-nilly. There is what is called the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations" target="_blank">standard order of operations</a></strong>. These are the rules of engagement, the <em>sine qua non</em>, what the French call the <em>without which not</em>, of doing arithmetic.  One acronym for these rules is <em>PEMDAS</em>: parentheses, exponentiation, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been doing arithmetic a long time, but you&#8217;ve probably only started SRSing relatively recently, SRS being a more recent invention than arithmetic. In SRSing we also have an order of operations AKA precedence rules AKA<strong> order of priority.</strong></p>
<p>As with arithmetic, the <strong>SOOP (SRS order of priority)</strong> &#8212; yet another meaningless acronym &#8212; tells us what to do first, if there is any doubt. Unlike the arithmetic rules, the SOOP is not hard and fast. It&#8217;s just an arbitrary set of guidelines to make our lives easier and prevent the harried, type-A, OCDish behavior you sometimes see exhibited by people who are SRSing &#8212; behavior that leads them to burn out, give up, and curse this SRSing thing as &#8220;useless&#8221; or &#8220;not for me&#8221;.</p>
<p>So here it is, the SOOP, which can further be abbreviated as DADRA (how do I keep coming up with these?!): Don&#8217;t Add, Delete, Review, Add.</p>
<h1>0. Don&#8217;t Add</h1>
<ul>
<li>The zeroth rule. Not adding anything to your SRS deck is the most &#8220;important&#8221; activity, in that it takes precedence over all the others. If in doubt, don&#8217;t add anything to the SRS. Just don&#8217;t. Too hard to add? Don&#8217;t add it. Can&#8217;t be bothered? Don&#8217;t be. When something really needs to be added to the SRS, it won&#8217;t feel like a chore at all.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1. Delete</h1>
<ul>
<li>The first rule. Delete. If in doubt, delete stuff. Delete. Delete. Deleted. Baleted. Let it go. There is perhaps nothing more threatening to your long-term SRSing prospects than bad cards. Nothing will drag down your repcount (reviewcount) more quickly and with more certainty, than the existence of large quantities of SRS cards you no longer give a care about. <strong>If in doubt, throw it out.</strong> Delete. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you would, could or should learn it. Delete it.</li>
<li><strong>What about &#8220;essential&#8221; language elements like individual kanji and/or kana and/or hangul, etc?</strong> Surely these can&#8217;t be deleted, right? Right? My original answer to that would have been a &#8220;yes, suck it up&#8221;. However, over time, my opinion has changed. I have found bad cards to be so destructive to SRSing that it is better to, yes, delete even cards containing essential, fundamental language elements. Call it &#8220;lazy processing&#8221;: you can always undelete, or re-add the cards later. If the language element is really that essential, you&#8217;ll be able to pick up the slack later.</li>
<li>Important: I personally prefer to delete one card a time. I say, resist the impulse to &#8220;push the reset button&#8221; &#8212; delete entire decks and start from scratch, because this robs you of the opportunity to discover the properties of the cards you <em>do</em> like and <em>are</em> worth keeping. Also, it&#8217;s a bit of a binge-purge behavior, which is something you don&#8217;t want.</li>
<li><strong>I virtually always do my deleting while reviewing</strong>. Remember, the SOOP tells us <strong>what matters most</strong>: it does not mean &#8220;do all of activity #n first before doing activity #n+1&#8221;. It just means: &#8220;if in doubt, if there is a conflict (of interests), default to the higher priority activity &#8212; activity #n&#8221;. So if you&#8217;re doing reviews but you get bored by one or more cards, and you&#8217;re not sure what to do, then just start deleting and don&#8217;t even bother stop until you hit a card that makes you <em>want</em> to do reviews.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2. Review</h1>
<ul>
<li>The second rule. Review cards. Do reps. It&#8217;s what we might call the most <strong>&#8220;normal&#8221;, &#8220;standard&#8221;, &#8220;vanilla&#8221; use of an SRS.</strong> Nothing much more to say here. Click. Show back. Set score. Next.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3. Add</h1>
<ul>
<li>The third rule. If all else fails, add some new SRS cards. Add new cards. Why is this last? What the hockey puck is wrong with you, Khatzumoto? Surely, even you, up on your AJATT cloud, are aware that you can&#8217;t delete or review cards without having first added them? Yes, of course, that is true. Remember, the SOOP merely tells us <strong>precedence</strong>. It tells us what should precede what, what should go first, iff there is any question as to what to do. However, by definition, if there are no cards, then while &#8220;don&#8217;t add&#8221; (the zeroth rule) will work, the first and second rules will <strong>default down to this one</strong>. What matters is to know that if in doubt, adding cards is the <em>least important</em> thing you can do.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we&#8217;re done. These are just random guidelines I came up with by myself. Yeah, I&#8217;m good-looking, but not omniscient. So I&#8217;d be happy to hear what you have to share, iff you&#8217;re good-looking as well.</p>
<p>Shallowly,</p>
<p>Khatzumoto</p>

I’m not doubting&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/beyond-binging-and-purging-why-you-maybe-shouldnt-try-overcorrecting-for-when-you-screw-up" target="_blank">this article on binging and purging</a>, I got this really cool comment from Maya, one of AJATT&#8217;s best link-suppliers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just out of curiosity, does anyone have any examples of when they started to fall behind in something and they eventually caught up by making it more fun/changing their style? I’m not doubting that this is the way to go; it’s just that I’d like a concrete example.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve fallen behind with my sentence reps (whereas I have no problem maintaining an immersion environment)… I think the problem is that I’ve come to look at the reps as “work/studying” (whereas as anime is always “recreational”)… even after deleting a decent chunk of sentences, the problem seems to persist. I’m currently almost a week behind in reps, and still can’t motivate myself to get around to doing them. I’ve obviously been doing something wrong, but I can’t figure out what.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is my response:</p>
<p>@Maya</p>
<p>Just one idea here (I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing what everyone else has to say):</p>
<p>Delete even more.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t go to your SRS to do reps any more.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to delete. </strong></p>
<p>Go for deletions. Deletions are your new &#8220;target metric&#8221;. Delete until you hit a sentence that you give a crap about. Then delete until you hit the next one like that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably overloaded with &#8220;should-learn&#8221; sentences &#8212; &#8220;<strong>shoulders</strong>&#8220;, like I was in Cantonese. Or maybe you have cool sentences, but they lack the punch they had when you entered them. Those are now &#8220;shoulders&#8221;, too.</p>
<p>Get rid of anything even remotely sucky. <strong>Delete. Delete. Delete.</strong> Don&#8217;t worry. You obviously don&#8217;t need them. You&#8217;ve been off the SRS a whole week, right? That&#8217;s a sign. A big, freaking sign.</p>
<p>Delete boring things from your SRS, otherwise they will &#8220;delete&#8221; you &#8212; they will &#8220;make&#8221; you never want to touch that SRS again.</p>
<p>Basically, Maya, you great discoverer of all things Disney and Japanese, you have two choices.</p>
<p>a) Delete bad sentences, however many there may be, so that you can do at least *some* SRSing.<br />
b) Never SRS again for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Right now, you&#8217;re on a collision course with (b).</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get rid of the whole deck in one go. A lot of people do that. I personally think that&#8217;s ill-advised. Delete. One by one. There will be some leftover items &#8212; &#8220;<strong>keepers</strong>&#8220;. The keepers will be the seeds of a renewed deck, a deck of keepers (mostly), a deck that makes you actually want to do reps. The keepers will have a pattern to them &#8212; format, length, source, content, whatever &#8212; that will guide you in acquiring more keepers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a really sucky deck, you could end up literally halving your cardcount &#8212; I once did. In the extreme, you could end up with only 10% of your original deck. No biggie. Let it go. Fuhgeddaboutit. Remember what&#8217;s at stake. <strong>Sentences are interchangeable. Motivation to learn is not.</strong></p>
<p>Let me share some of my Japanese sentence deck stats for today with you, to give you a quantitative perspective on the whole thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repcount: 135</li>
<li>Added: 2 cards</li>
<li>Deleted: 100 cards.</li>
<li>Total: ~235 cards processed, ~42% deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>135 reps and 100 deletions is infinitely better than 0 reps and 0 deletions.</strong> Now let&#8217;s extrapolate &#8212; assuming about the exact same daily performance over the course of one week, that comes to nearly 1000 reps and 700 deletions. 1000 to 0. That&#8217;s not 1000 times better, M-star. That&#8217;s  &#8220;even more infinitely better&#8221; than 0 reps and 0 deletions.  <strong>∞:0 ratio. </strong></p>
<p>So, go break some eggs and make that omelette <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>We all have such noble intentions with our sentences. We all want to be good kids; we want to do the right thing; we want to eat everything that&#8217;s given us. But <strong>being an obedient doormat and being an effective learner are not, repeat, not the same thing.</strong></p>
<p>Know your &#8220;rights&#8221;. The right to enjoyment (= the <strong>right to veto boredom</strong>) is one that school &#8212; my favorite scapegoat for everything &#8212; would tend to try to discourage you from exercising, so we often forget that we even have it; we equate exercising it with being &#8220;lazy&#8221;, unproductive, irresponsible. But now you know to say no to uninteresting sentences.</p>
<p>You can keep being liberal about what enters your SRS deck, just be liberal about what leaves it, as well. Garbage in, garbage out.</p>
<p>Written from painful and rather embarrassing-to-share experience,</p>
<p>Khatz</p>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p>Through the magic of deletion, Maya has since turned SRSing from a chore, back into a game and now lives a full, happy, besentenced life <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/beyond-binging-and-purging-why-you-maybe-shouldnt-try-overcorrecting-for-when-you-screw-up#comments" target="_blank">In her own words</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to everyone for their advice!</p>
<p>To sum things up, I’ve gone through my deck and deleted ~450 or so cards that were boring/unpleasant/so easy that they had become useless. I’m not quite done yet; I can still realistically see myself deleting another 50-200 cards, but I think I’m getting much closer now.</p>
<p>I’ve also decided to change the pace at which I add/learn sentences. When I started doing sentences, I wasn’t actually done with RTK; I was just impatient, and I figured that I could “pick up” the remaining kanji on the go. This never happened/isn’t likely to happen, and my incomplete knowledge of kanji is creating problems for me, so I want to go back and finish learning them properly. I’ll still add/learn sentences, but at a much slower rate (at least temporarily); I actually see this as a really good thing, because it will encourage me to only add a small quantity of really good sentences, instead of adding tons of nonsense, as I seem to have been doing the past while. Needless to say, my overall immersion environment won’t change.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for your advice/anecdotes/encouragement!</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Today was my first day doing reps anew &#8211; I went through a hundred of ‘em in under half an hour. This definitely wouldn’t have been possible a couple weeks ago <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>Everything felt fresh and simple &lt;3</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey. It&#8217;s chilly outside. It&#8217;s toasty inside. I&#8217;ve got this&#8230;Honeywell space heater action going here. Movies get watched, okay?</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s transcript is from <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC" target="_blank"><em>Gladiator</em></a>. One of my favorite movies. I didn&#8217;t get round to seeing it until about 2005. Being a man of extensive <em>huevos</em>, I personally did not cry at the end, but, my&#8230;friend did. Anywhere, here&#8217;s the English and Japanese. Also:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/audio/gladiatorspeech.mp3" target="_blank">The Japanese audio of the speech</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Commodus</strong></span>: How dare you show your back to me! Slave, you will remove your helmet and tell me your name.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Maximus</strong></span>: <em>[removes helmet and turns around to face Commodus]</em> My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>コンモドゥス</strong></span>：「<a href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/226009/m1u/%E4%BD%99/">余</a>に背を向けるのか？無礼者！兜を脱ぎ、名を名乗るのだ！」</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>マキシマス</strong></span>：「名はマキシマス＝デシマス＝メリディアス、<br />
北軍の司令官、フェリキス軍団の将軍、<br />
真の皇帝、マルクス＝アウレリウスの家臣。<br />
殺された幼子の父、殺された妻の夫。<br />
今生でなくば来世で（その）復讐を果たす。」</p></blockquote>
<p>I like how the Japanese pronunciation (vowels, especially) is much closer to what we presume (?) Latin sounded like&#8230;well, the &#8220;Marcus Aurelius&#8221; part at least; Maximus&#8217; name seems like it was modeling the English. Anyway, enjoy!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was feeling nostalgic last night, so I swiss-cheesed Independence Day like three times &#8212; in fact, I&#8217;m watching it as I write this.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, that famous President&#8217;s speech is so cool, and the subs in the Japanese version are so unlike the dub (most likely made at different times, on different timelines, with different intentions, by different people), that I thought it fit to, since I can, transcribe the Japanese speech for you and put it up here.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all this is copyright 20th Century Fox or whoever, i.e. not me, so&#8230;if they want it down, it goes down <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Just for kicks, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/audio/id4speech.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is a sound clip</a> as well. If anyone whines about the quality, I josh you not, choking will occur <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>This film&#8217;s got great pacing. I&#8217;d always thought it was 90 minutes long. It&#8217;s actually two and a half <em>hours</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>お早う。<br />
お早う！</p>
<p>一時間後には、<br />
諸君は飛び立ち、<br />
世界中の仲間と合流する。</p>
<p>そして人類始まって以來最大の空中戦に臨む事に成る。<br />
然う、「人類」。<br />
この言葉に今日、新しい意味を持たせよう。</p>
<p>これからは、些細な違い等にコダワって居ては行けない。<br />
我々は共通の目的で団結する。</p>
<p>この日が、七月四日だというのも不思議な巡り合わせだ。<br />
我々はもう一度独立の為に戦う。</p>
<p>敵が求める物は、弾圧や迫害ではない。<br />
人類の滅亡だ。<br />
生き殘る権利を賭けて戦おう。</p>
<p>必ず、勝利の旗を掲げ、<br />
七月四日という日を、<br />
単なるアメリカの独立記念日ではなくするのだ！</p>
<p>世界が声を揃えて宣言した日だ！</p>
<h2>「我々は決して音無しく死の闇に消えたりはしない！</h2>
<h2>我々は決して戦わずして死にはしない！</h2>
<h2>皆で生きるのだ！</h2>
<h2>生き殘るのだ！</h2>
<h2>今日　我々の　独立記念日を祝おう！」</h2>
<p>Ｕ・Ｓ・Ａ！<br />
Ｕ・Ｓ・Ａ！<br />
Ｕ・Ｓ・Ａ！</p></blockquote>
<p>Enjoy. Go here for the <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechindependenceday.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original English text of the speech</a>. And if you haven&#8217;t got your Japanese DVD yet, either visit your rental store or the <a href="http://astore.amazon.co.jp/alljapanallth-22/detail/B001EI5M14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJATT Amazon store</a>, or, or something!</p>
<p><sub>※音無しい（おとなしい）is a non-standard &#8212; but not non-existent &#8212; kanji representation of 温和しい/大人しい. I like it because it reflects precisely what the President was saying in the original English: &#8220;We will not go <em>quietly</em>[=soundlessly] into the night!&#8221;, as you can see from the characters.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 2 of 4 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/why-the-way-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it/" class="series-144" title="Why The Way We Read Sucks, And How To Fix It">Why The Way We Read Sucks, And How To Fix It</a></div><p>This is the third post in a continuing series on Why The Way We Read Sucks and How To Fix It. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-how-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-part-1" target="_blank">Go here to read the series from the beginning</a>.</p>
<p>Please take all this advice <em>cum grano salis</em>. Take it for what it is &#8212; one star (don&#8217;t say &#8220;yeah, a supernova&#8221;, really&#8230;just don&#8217;t) in a galaxy of information about reading. Everyone has their pet-techniques, and everyone&#8217;s situation is different to some degree. As <a href="http://edufire.com/forums/1-the-fireside-chat/topics/2178-all-japanese-all-time" target="_blank">a wise young woman on the Internets</a> once said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;no method will ever be 100% perfect for anyone except its creator.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this, this entire site, is just my personal&#8230;thing, so&#8230;don&#8217;t take it too seriously. You definitely want to try, pick and choose what works and what doesn&#8217;t for you. <strong>My own methods are constantly evolving</strong>, so in a sense you could say I end up disagreeing with myself now and then. And, <strong>i</strong><strong>f I disagree with me sometimes, </strong><strong>so should you</strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . A few months from now, I may not even be using any of the techniques I&#8217;m about to share with you. So, keep that in mind <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<h2><strong>Why did I get into this reading technique thing anyway?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, It&#8217;s complicated. But only slightly so. Basically, I had <strong>two different sets of reading problems</strong> with (1) native-level languages, and (2) sucky-level languages. These two problem sets ended up being <strong>fixed with the same solution</strong>. And that&#8217;s what makes this article-series seem complicated: I&#8217;m really <strong>attempting to discuss two things at the same time</strong>. Confusing, I know. I&#8217;m a cruel, inconsiderate man &#8212; get used to it.</p>
<p>One thing common to both sets of problems is that, despite continuing efforts, electronic books are yet to reach the level of availability, let alone convenience, to allow one to go &#8220;all electronic&#8221;. My ultimate goal is 100% digitization, which would render a lot of this book-handling business obsolete.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some issues that were unique to each set of problems:</p>
<p><strong>Problem Set 1: Native-Level Languages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too many books</strong> in possession &#8212; major life decisions are starting to be made <em>around</em>the welfare of the books that are supposed to be getting read or re-read at some point, but aren&#8217;t.
<ul>
<li>Books are getting &#8220;lost in the sea&#8221;, hidden under and behind other books.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading a bit, but <strong>wanting to read much more</strong>, and also <strong>suck the most value out of each book</strong>.</li>
<li>A lot of good <strong>half-read books</strong> that warrant more reading (full of potentially good information), but that have been side-tracked by other books.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting the content</strong> of fully-read books, leading to a desire to <strong>keep</strong>books &#8220;for future reference/re-reading&#8221;, even though there are already&#8230;too many books in the house, and the world.
<ul>
<li>I especially had the desire to have the content of <strong>personal development books</strong> more readily available in my head, in my life, where it could more readily affect my behavior. This basically lead me to start <strong>SRSing quotes</strong>. More on that later&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guilt about skipping pages.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Problem Set 2: Sucky-Level Languages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have books, keep getting more, but <strong>not reading</strong> any of them because the reading is <strong>too painful</strong></li>
<li>Too many stops (&#8220;better SRS this; no pain no gain, be arch&#8221;).</li>
<li>Too much guilt about skipping.</li>
<li>Trying to catch everything and getting bored/tired out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two different sets of reading problems <strong>united</strong> by a single solution. Hence, the <em>Unified</em> Reading Process.</p>
<h2><strong>URP: The Unified Reading Process</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unified reading process (this sounds so&#8230;Proctor &amp; Gamble&#8230;I love it) I currently use for each book is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy</li>
<li>Read &amp; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-how-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-part-2" target="_blank">Dog-ear</a></li>
<li>Stack</li>
<li>Un-dog-ear &amp; Enter quotes into SRS</li>
<li>Either:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>(a) Discard (give away, resell) || OR ||</li>
<li>(b) Keep &amp; Reprocess from step (2)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of native-level languages, I tend to discard &#8212; i.e. give away to friends or resell. In the case of sucky-level languages, I tend to keep and reprocess. This has less to do with the languages themselves, and more with the fact that the very nature of things means that the more proficient one is at a given language the more likely one is to have a surplus of books in it.</p>
<p><strong>The key to discarding is to not force yourself to instantly make a permanent decision </strong>(while still retaining that defining characteristic of real decisions: clarity). Instead, split the decision into two clear, instant parts. In my case, I have a temporary &#8220;to discard&#8221; box with a deadline on it. Once the deadline is reached or the box becomes full, <em>then</em> the permanent discarding happens. So a book could be waiting there in the temporary bin for a month or more. Plenty of time to reconsider any decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, as you can see, it&#8217;s a really simple process. Here are just some of the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books are always more or less in a clear <em>state</em>: Unread, In-process, or Read. This leads to less ambiguity, and therefore easier management.</li>
<li>Books turn into pieces of clearly memorized knowledge rather than just space-consuming things that are &#8220;good to have&#8221;, or things that you read once and kind of remember, but need to read again to &#8220;brush up&#8221;.</li>
<li>You get to do a lot of reading without the long-term burden of physically owning/moving/storing a lot of books.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Low Conversion, Revisited (skip this<strong> part </strong>if you want)</strong></h2>
<p>At the risk of repeating myself, the <strong>keyphrase</strong> throughout the process is <strong>low conversion</strong>. By &#8220;conversion&#8221;, I mean the <strong>fraction</strong> of the book in question that gets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read closely, and/or</li>
<li><em>Converted</em> into SRS cards.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only a <strong>fraction</strong> of the pages of a book get read closely, in detail. Only a <strong>fraction</strong> of these pages get dog-eared. Only a <strong>fraction</strong> of the content of a <strong>fraction</strong> of the dog-eared pages gets entered into the SRS. Fraction. Fraction. Fraction.</p>
<p>No matter how much you own or suck at the language, <strong>conversion is low </strong>by nature. In fact, ironically enough, <strong>the more you suck at a language, the lower your conversion will probably be</strong> (for one thing, there&#8217;s only so much you&#8217;ll be able to read well&#8230;and then there&#8217;s the other extreme, where your conversion goes low because you already have so much prior knowledge). You see, <strong>conversion takes work</strong>. And there is only so much work that you can do. Far less than you wish you could. But that&#8217;s okay, because humans are smart; you could argue that we&#8217;re built to be lazy and low-conversion.</p>
<p>Even people who <em>intend</em> to have high conversion end up with low conversion. In fact, the <strong>more pressure</strong> you put on yourself to convert, the more likely you are to (eventually, unconsciously) <strong>rebel and end up with 0% conversion</strong>. Zero conversion is fine if the book sucked that much, but it&#8217;s not so fine when the book is otherwise good &#8212; well-written, and about a topic you&#8217;re interested in.</p>
<p>The way to deal with <strong>sucky books</strong> is simple &#8212; <strong>throw them away</strong> as soon as the suck is clear; get rid of them.<strong> </strong>My problem was that I was having trouble approaching the books I <em>liked</em>, books I had chosen, books I knew were good; I wasn&#8217;t even picking them up any more. And the root of the problem was my attempt to have <strong>high conversion</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, that&#8217;s all for now. But the series continues!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 1 of 4 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/why-the-way-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it/" class="series-144" title="Why The Way We Read Sucks, And How To Fix It">Why The Way We Read Sucks, And How To Fix It</a></div><p>There&#8217;s so much I want to say on this topic. But it would take too long to put it all together, so I&#8217;m going to do what we always do here at AJATT &#8212; give it to you piecemeal.</p>
<p>As with everything on this site, the advice here is just based on my personal experience. I&#8217;m not an expert. Take what works, leave what doesn&#8217;t &#8212; the overall principles matter more than the minutiae of technique. Your mileage may vary and all that (then again, I am quite confident that it won&#8217;t vary by that much &#8212; otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t be writing it, eh lads, eh?).</p>
<p>Also, an interesting thing happened. While I originally intended this advice to be specifically directed towards languages we suck at (i.e. early- and mid-stage foreign languages), I soon found that it applied just as well to reading languages where we have native-level skill. Yay!</p>
<p>Anyway, first, a little bit about:</p>
<p><strong>The Sucky Way We Read</strong></p>
<p>By &#8220;how we read&#8221;, I mean &#8220;how we are taught to read in school&#8221;. Fortunately for me, growing up, I did a lot (indeed, most) of my reading entirely outside of the school framework, so for a long time I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;infected&#8221; as much by the school disease &#8212; at the very least, I was asymptomatic for many years.</p>
<p>But over time, it did get to me as well. So much so that I had to reach back into my childhood and reflect on what I had been doing outside of school, why it was so much fun, and why it worked so well, in order to get my then-stalled reading habits back on track <sub>(in the early years of my adult life, I went through a stage where I was basically not doing any reading, despite having a strong desire to read and a history of reading)</sub>.</p>
<p>The style of reading that is typically taught and/or encouraged in school is all about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hitting every single word.</li>
<li>No change of pace or shifting gears.</li>
<li>No skipping unless teacher says so. Any self-directed <strong>skipping is &#8220;cheating&#8221;</strong>, and is to be punctuated by feelings of guilt and remorse (aren&#8217;t these, like, synonyms?).</li>
<li>Zero or severely limited choice in terms of start time, stop time and duration.</li>
<li>Zero or severely limited in terms of reading material, with no option to change after initial choice.</li>
<li>The order in which the book is written and presented is the One, True and Only Correct Order. You have no right to permute it or ignore it. You earn the right to read page p+1 only after perfectly reading page p.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that so many adults never pick up another real book once they leave school. If you&#8217;d never ever been allowed to set or change the channel on your TV, and <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-and-what-to-read" target="_blank">never been taught that you even had the right or ability to make such a judgment call</a>, then you&#8217;d probably hate TV, too &#8212; no matter how many &#8220;TV-worms&#8221; (think: bookworm) told you that TV was the shizzle and that there were tons of great channels and shows out there.</p>
<p>The above is a style of reading that is, on the surface, well -suited to an early-stage student. After all, does someone who can barely read or who barely knows the subject matter at hand, really have the ability to decide where and what to skip? (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/massive-turnover" target="_blank">Actually my answer to that is &#8220;yes&#8221;</a>, but, school&#8217;s answer tends to be a resounding &#8220;no&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>Why How We Read Sucks</strong></p>
<p>My guess is that the core reason why this reading style came about in the first place is because, at one time, in many parts of the world, there simply weren&#8217;t that many books, period. So, reading one book a year was fine, since you only owned one book and maybe had access to a few more. Oftentimes, the books in question were these massive, dense, metaphor-laden sacred texts, which probably do lend themselves to a special style of reading <sub>(then again, judging by how few people of any religious persuasion actually read sacred texts, perhaps these too could benefit from techniques like those I&#8217;m intending to share).</sub></p>
<p>Of course, things have changed. A lot. At least in terms of the number of books available. But in most schools and classes, the reign of <a href="http://globalmaverick.org/archives/349-the-tyranny-of-a-single-source-of-information" target="_blank">tyranny of a single source of information</a> continues. Moreover, the semi-compulsive behavior of reading (or, attempting to read) <strong>every-single-word-on-every-single-page-so-you-get-exactly-what-was-said-and-don&#8217;t-miss-a-single-thing</strong> is exacerbated by the earnest student&#8217;s fear of &#8220;missing&#8221; something that might be &#8220;on the test&#8221;. In fact, many tests are designed to reward this <strong>one-tree-matters-more-than-the-entire-forest </strong>type of reading.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just <strong>no sense of priority</strong>; everything becomes equally important. It&#8217;s as if the Pareto Principle never existed. Indeed, some people might argue that that was the point: <a href="http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/" target="_blank">it is said that most school systems in the world today are based on a design that aims to produce compliant, docile factory workers</a> &#8212; people who unquestioningly obey pre-made decisions, not people who make them. Those who go on to be managers get let in on the secret that most decisions are arbitrary, but people lower down on the ladder are to be left in the dark, believing that the pre-made decisions are absolute, based on the perfect or near-perfect knowledge of their elders and betters (&#8220;experts&#8221;, &#8220;superiors&#8221;), and carrying all the weight of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings" target="_blank">divine decree</a>.</p>
<p>OK, social engineering, blah blah whatever. Let&#8217;s not get too worked up. The deeper problem is that to force yourself to read everything is to <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone" target="_blank">force yourself out of your growth/true-comfort zone and into either your boredom zone or your panic zone</a> (both of which are places where you are just going to&#8230;wait for the pun&#8230;&#8221;zone out&#8221;).</p>
<p>This leads to stress. <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/15639.php" target="_blank">Stress makes you forgetful: short-term memory gets pwned</a>. No short term memory → no long-term memory. No long-term memory → no learning new information. No new information → less intelligent choices, far less brilliant flashes of insight. Less intelligent choices → more stupid choices. In short, <strong>the way school typically teaches us to read, makes us stupid</strong>. As in, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Republican</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>Gilmore Girls</em></span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the end of <em>Prison Break</em> </span>running out of cheap jokes stupid. The phrase &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; starts to take on a whole new meaning..</p>
<p>And now that we&#8217;re done complaining and making sweeping judgments and dubious historical references, it&#8217;s time to talk about how to fix the problem! But for that, dear children of the AJATT, ye shall have to wait for the very <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-how-we-read-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-part-2" target="_blank">forthcoming sequel to this article &#8212; part deux</a>! Wherein shall be demonstrated reading techniques that can <strong>help you have more fun</strong> reading any language, including Japanese.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another kid named J.R. (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/about-srssentence-writing-practice" target="_blank">different from the last</a>!), all up in my email:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Khatz,</p>
<p>Your method when applied to languages like Chinese and Japanese makes perfect sense but I am trying to learn Korean and Finnish.</p>
<p>My problem is with Finnish. A Finnish word can have up to 14 cases so do I need to make a sentence for each case?  If done that way, it seems like I could make it to 10,000 sentences quite easily, but the 10,000 wouldn&#8217;t be the same as say 10,000 in Japanese/Korean/Chinese.</p>
<p>Appreciate the feedback.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, first of all, I have a secret <sup>(the secret, the secret)</sup> to tell you. Come closer. Closer. &#8216;K, here we go:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-no-grammar" target="_blank"><strong>There are no cases in Finnish.</strong><sup>*</sup></a></p>
<p>Just make whatever sentences you need to make as things come out of your immersion environment. Just treat everything as if it were a different word. Focus on the difference in *meaning*, since that&#8217;s what actually counts.</p>
<p>Think about it in English &#8212; fundamentally, the difference between &#8220;I go to school&#8221; and &#8220;I went to school&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of tenses of the verb &#8220;to go&#8221; or whatever&#8230;the two words, &#8220;go&#8221; and &#8220;went&#8221;&#8230;the two sentences actually have different meanings. In theory, they are mutations of the same word. In practice, they are different words. &#8220;He eats the food&#8221;, &#8220;he ate the food&#8221; &#8212; these things are different.</p>
<p>Looked at this way, <strong>grammatical inflection ceases to be a burden, and instead becomes a <em>tool</em></strong> for expressing oneself more precisely. You go from &#8220;Effing sonofa I have to learn all this effing mothereffing B.S.&#8221; to &#8220;SWEET! I can tell people what I will have done if I were to have been X; the future really is perfect!&#8221;.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t think of the depth of variation of a single word. <strong>Pretend everything is flat</strong>. Treat everything as its own, independent word. Sometimes, it&#8217;s just easier this way. In practice, this does mean that every case will eventually be represented in your SRS, but not that you&#8217;ll necessarily have to decline or conjugate every single word that inflects &#8212; you are after all a human being; you know a pattern when you see it; you don&#8217;t need everything declared; you&#8217;re a gap-filling, pattern-matching machine. Do as much as you need to &#8220;get it&#8221;, and no more.</p>
<p>As for number of sentences, I doubt more than 10k will be necessary to reach a high level of proficiency. Remember that the sentences are just a tool/by-product for and of massive exposure to native materials.</p>
<p>For more, check out <a href="http://www.antimoon.com/" target="_blank">AntiMoon.com</a> &#8212; Tomasz and the crew wrote about learning English, which is closer to what you&#8217;re trying to do in terms of certain language features.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#8217;t actually tried to learn Finnish, but if I were to, this is exactly how I would do it. Starting with a phrasebook, I would just accept the sentences &#8220;as is&#8221;, and let the patterns present themselves to me over time. In any case the key is always to realize this: <strong>learning a language does not require pain, boredom or suffering</strong>.</p>
<p><sup><sup><sub>*OK, maybe there are, but only because and  as long as people keep saying so. They&#8217;re a theoretical construct that&#8217;s generally useful for analysis, and generally worth crap-all for praxis.</sub></sup></sup></p>
