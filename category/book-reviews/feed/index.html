								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, remember the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-can-a-dancer-teach-you-about-learning-japanese/">Twyla Tharp &#8220;Dancing to Japanese Fluency&#8221; thing from before</a>? Good times, huh? And remember how, in the course of all the dancing talk, we made mention of a little Japanese book with a powerful idea? And remember how we promised to get into a lot of detail about it someday?</p>
<p>No? Yes?</p>
<p>Whatever. Anyway, strap in, strap on and strap up because we are going to discuss, dissect and&#8230;some other word that begins with &#8220;d&#8221;, what is, in my arrogant opinion, literally one of the greatest works of nonfiction ever produced in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>I am not joking. This is not hyperbole. This is pure, solid gold.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://amzn.to/29JUAE9">[The Power of Continuing / The Power to Continue: The Royal Road to Success in Work and Study by Makoto ITOU / 続ける力―仕事・勉強で成功する王道 (幻冬舎新書) | 伊藤 真 | 本 | Amazon.co.jp]</a></h1>
<p>There are not enough words in my painfully limited vocabulary to describe how awesome, how powerful, how beautiful, how actionable this book is. Usually, I just tell people to &#8220;read it&#8221; because I can&#8217;t actually express how good it is.</p>
<p>OMG! OMG! OMG! I&#8217;m getting excited just *thinking* about telling you about it! Eek!</p>
<p>And we are going to work through it so you can taste the awesomeness, too.</p>
<p>You know, I really, truly, madly, deeply, sincerely hope you&#8217;ve got your swimming trunks on, because you&#8217;re about to get drenched in knowledge.</p>
<p>No, really.</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get wet. Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you. Like, don&#8217;t write back to me and be all like: &#8220;Khatz, WTF? I&#8217;m drenched in knowledge, son! Coulda used a heads-up with regard to waterproof clothing&#8221;: this <em>is</em> your heads-up!</p>
<p>OK. Brass tacks.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;</p>
<p>The author. Makoto ITOU. Who the heck is he and why the heck should you care? Well, if you&#8217;d calm down for more than three freaking seconds, I might have a chance to tell you.</p>
<p>Standing at a majestic 6&#8217;2&#8243;, ITOU Makoto was born in Tokyo and raised in Germany. He wasn&#8217;t 6 foot 2 when he was born. Presumably, Germany did that to him. Fast-forward to college, he studied law at Tokyo University and passed the bar exam while still an undergrad there. This is considered to be, how you say in the seemple Eenglish, a big deal.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Until relatively recently, you didn&#8217;t need a law degree &#8212; or if I recall correctly, any degree at all, to take become a lawyer in Japan. All you needed to do was pass the bar exam. Pure meritocracy. Black and white. It was simple, straightforward and beautiful. Straightforward, but legendarily difficult without an SRS.</p>
<p>With the violent drop in Japan&#8217;s birthrate (and, beginning in 2006, the absolute decline of Japan&#8217;s population), schools and universities have been desperate for bodies. Combine that with the protectionista-unionista mindset common to any professional guild, and now one needs a law degree to become a lawyer in the Japan. Not only that, but there&#8217;s now an upper limit to the number of tries you get at the taking the bar exam. It used to be <strong>unlimited retries &#8212; like playing &#8220;Super Mario Bros.&#8221; on an emulator</strong>. Now, you only get, like, three or four lives.</p>
<p>ITOU is a practicing lawyer (and a noted constitutional scholar; he&#8217;s a big believer in the post-war Japanese constitution, particularly the pacifist Article 9). But <strong>what he&#8217;s really famous for, far moreso than actually practicing law, is the fine work of helping other people become lawyers by teaching them how to pass the bar exam with flying colors.</strong></p>
<p>Where were we&#8230;?<br />
Oh yeah!</p>
<p>You see, Japanese people are, it turns out, human beings (who&#8217;da thunk it? Well, apparently not all the people who insist on over-mystifying people from Asia). And like human beings around the world, they enjoy being scared. They enjoy telling and believing stories about things being &#8220;difficult&#8221; or &#8220;impossible&#8221;. ITOU basically spends time busting kneecaps and/or myths about the exam&#8217;s difficulty, and, by extension, about the difficulty of learning anything at all.</p>
<p>He is a driven, pragmatic, systematic and successful optimist and spending any amount of time with him (or his words) will make you one, too. &#8220;The Power of Continuing&#8221; is to learning as the &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/Inner-Game-Golf-Timothy-Gallwey-ebook/dp/B001NLKZZ0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501030881&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=inner+game+of+golf">Inner Game of Golf</a>&#8221; and the &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/新インナーゲーム-インナーシリーズ-W-T-ガルウェイ/dp/4817202106/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501030946&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=インナーゲーム">Inner Game of Tennis</a>&#8221; were to&#8230;I dunno&#8230;golf and tennis &#8212; <strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2uVsxOF">both a philosophical meditation from a master of his field and a practical manual for life that you can actually transmute into action</a>.</strong></p>
<p>ITOU&#8217;s are not airy-fairy pothead musings or vague proclamations, but brutally clear, direct and efficient steps that you can take starting today.</p>
<p>OK! Enough introduction! Let&#8217;s start letting the man speak and his wisdom for himself&#8230;itself&#8230;themselves?&#8230;Dunno what pronoun to use here. Screw it! Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhiDym4EGMw">You can do it all night long</a></h1>
<p>■「やればできる!必ずできる!」: &#8220;You can do it if you try. You will be able to to do it if you keep trying. &#8220;必ず&#8221; &#8212; it is inevitable.&#8221;<br />
[Japanese character readings for the nerd in you]
必ず＝かならず<br />
遣る＝やる<br />
出来る＝できる</p>
<h1>As long as you continue, you can&#8217;t lose</h1>
<p>■「すべての成功は「続ける力」から生まれる。そして「続ける力」はだれもが持っている。あなたがこれまで飽きっぽく、思うように成果を上げられなかったのは、その力を引き出す方法を知らなかっただけなのだ。」: &#8220;All success is born from the ability to continue. And anybody can continue.&#8221; This is a potent choice of words. ITOU doesn&#8217;t say we need to &#8220;persist&#8221; or &#8220;be persistent&#8221; only to &#8220;continue&#8221;. Just continue. He continues: &#8220;The only reason why you haven&#8217;t succeeded up until now is because you didn&#8217;t know how to draw this power out of yourself.&#8221;<br />
[Japanese character readings]
続ける＝つづける<br />
力＝ちから<br />
生む＝うむ<br />
持つ＝もつ<br />
飽きっぽい＝あきっぽい<br />
知る＝しる<br />
引き出す＝ひきだす</p>
<p>■「続ける限り『負け』は無い」： &#8220;As long as you continue, you won&#8217;t lose; you can&#8217;t lose.&#8221;<br />
限り＝かぎり<br />
負け＝まけ<br />
無い＝ない</p>
<p>■「一流の人は『続ける技術』を持っている」： &#8220;The great ones are great at continuing. They have techniques for continuing.&#8221;<br />
一流＝いちりゅう<br />
持つ＝もつ<br />
技術＝ぎじゅつ</p>
<h1>Talent does not exist</h1>
<p>■Quoting Shogi (Japanese chess) Grand Master Yoshiharu HABU (羽生善治):「・・・同じ情熱を傾けられる事が才能だと思っている・・・継続出来る情熱を持てる人の方が、長い目で見ると伸びるのだ。」: &#8220;[I used to think that talent was this magical momentary thing, but now I think that] the ability to keep coming back to the same thing with that same intensity is, I think, the true meaning of talent. In the long run, the people who can continue being passionate about something are the ones who grow and succeed.&#8221;<br />
羽生善治＝はぶよしはる<br />
情熱＝じょうねつ<br />
才能＝さいのう</p>
<p>■「法律の勉強は語学学習に似て、マスターする為には知識だけでなく、「慣れ」が必要です。」： &#8220;Studying the law is a lot like learning a language. You don&#8217;t need to master it, you need to get used to it.&#8221;<br />
法律＝ほうりつ<br />
学習＝がくしゅう<br />
似る＝にる</p>
<p>■「・・・不合格のまま終わる人は、頭が悪かったのではなく、勉強を続けられなかっただけの場合が殆どです。」： &#8220;<span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>People who fail at the bar exam [or learning a language] aren&#8217;t stupid: they just didn&#8217;t continue studying</strong></span>.&#8221;<br />
不合格＝ふごうかく<br />
儘＝侭＝まま<br />
悪い＝わるい</p>
<h1>The power to continue doesn&#8217;t discriminate</h1>
<p>■「・・・『続ける力」さえあればどんな夢でも叶うというのは・・・私・・・の体験から得た、実感的真実です。」: &#8220;It is my experience that the truth is this: if you can continue, you can make any dream come true.&#8221;<br />
叶う＝かなう<br />
体験＝たいけん<br />
得る＝える</p>
<p>■「・・・『続ける力」は誰にでも平等に与えられています。」: &#8220;The power to continue doesn&#8217;t discriminate. Everybody has it in equal amounts.&#8221;<br />
誰＝だれ<br />
平等＝びょうどう<br />
与える＝あたえる</p>
<p>■Not content to simply be tall, handsome and awesome, Mako-chan also manages to echo the wisdom of blogger Susan B., who herself points out that: &#8220;good decisions are not based on momentary desires&#8221;. Put another way, if you don&#8217;t love a language enough to spend the rest of your life on it, you won&#8217;t even love it enough to spend all of the next two years on it. In the words of Makoto (yeah. We&#8217;re on a first-name basis. Deal with it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ):<br />
「続けないのは『意思が弱いから」ではない・・・本当に好きな事なら続けられる筈」: <strong>&#8220;&#8216;Lack of willpower&#8217; is not why people don&#8217;t continue&#8230;If you really loved doing it, you&#8217;d be able to continue&#8221;.</strong><br />
意思＝いし<br />
弱い＝よわい<br />
続ける＝つづける</p>
<h1>It&#8217;s hard because it&#8217;s too easy</h1>
<p>■It&#8217;s not painful or complex, it&#8217;s simple and boring:<br />
「英単語の暗記にしろ、野球の素振りにしろ、ダイエットのリバウンド防止にしろ、継続すべき努力というのは、退屈な物が殆どです。『辛く苦しい事』以上に続けるのが難しいのは、『退屈で単純な事』です。」<br />
(&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s memorizing English vocab, practicing your baseball swing or prevented a slideback in your diet, work that needs to be continued is, in general, boring. Work that&#8217;s painful and complex is actually easier to continue than work that is simple, straightforward and boring&#8221;).<br />
英単語＝えいたんご<br />
素振り＝すぶり<br />
退屈＝たいくつ<br />
And that, darling, is <strong>why the AJATT method, such as it is, focusses so much on having fun learning and making learning fun, because if you can take care of that, then everything is simple. In truth, there is no AJATT method except to have fun and make fun. That&#8217;s the Prime Directive.</strong> Everything else, even SRS usage, is subordinate to that. Human beings will risk their lives and pee in their pants if it&#8217;s for fun and adventure (bungee jumping, skydiving, freediving, mountaineering, space travel, anyone?), but you can scarcely get even the grown-up ones to wash their own dishes if it&#8217;s boring.</p>
<p>One is reminded of the wisdom of Jim Rohn (paraphrase): &#8220;Success is easy; you only have to do easy things to succeed; the problem is that the things that are easy to do are easy NOT to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>■How to keep going when it&#8217;s simple and boring:<br />
「『単純で退屈な事』を長続きさせるコツ・・・やるべき事を徹底的に絞り込んで、飽きや退屈さのハードルを下げる」<br />
&#8220;The trick to keeping going when things are boring is to ruthlessly reduce the number of things you need to do [80/20 principle] and make them less boring [by reducing the time available to do them&#8221;<br />
単純＝たんじゅん<br />
長続き＝ながつづき<br />
徹底的＝てっていとき<br />
絞り込む＝しぼりこむ<br />
兀＝こつ<br />
Here, Makoto essentially channels the <strong>Pareto Principle and Parkison&#8217;s Law</strong>. When he was studying the Japanese Bar Exam, much of which involves handwritten essay answers, his <em>sempais</em> warned him that having bad handwriting would automatically lower his score. He needed to get good at handwriting again. But, no longer being a kid in middle school, he didn&#8217;t have the time to do it. He quickly figured out how to do improve by a lot by doing a little: write kanji bigger, write kana smaller, and keep his characters aligned along vertical and horizontal axes. <strong>He practiced writing out common legalese phrases like that for just five minutes a day, and his scores rose as if he knew more.</strong> He didn&#8217;t know more, he just wrote better.</p>
<h1>Slumps are normal</h1>
<p>■You don&#8217;t &#8220;have&#8221; time, you make time<br />
「続かないのは『時間が取れないから」ではない」<br />
&#8220;Failure to continue does not come from lack of time&#8221;<br />
続く＝つづく<br />
時間＝じかん<br />
取る＝とる<br />
Nobody &#8220;has&#8221; time. You MAKE time. You make it by turning your exceptions (e.g. Japanese) into habits, from turning them into things you don&#8217;t just do once in a while, but always do, every day. Don&#8217;t &#8220;work hard&#8221;, don&#8217;t &#8220;overcome&#8221; just <a href="https://goo.gl/14xXU3">make friends with the language.</a></p>
<p><strong>■You&#8217;re having a slump <em>because</em> you&#8217;re awesome</strong><br />
「スランプになるのは、頑張っている証拠」<br />
&#8220;The fact that you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-eternal-sorrow-of-the-intermediate-learner-“are-we-there-yet”-syndrome/">having a slump means that you&#8217;ve actually been working hard and improvin</a>g&#8221;<br />
頑張る＝がんばる<br />
証拠＝しょうこ<br />
成る＝なる<br />
<strong>Everybody goes through lows. Times when you (feel like you) are not progressing. This is normal.</strong> Don&#8217;t let yourself get too worked up about it and fall into the abyss. One or two things going badly does not mean the whole project is going badly. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it/"><strong>Don&#8217;t amputate your leg just because it&#8217;s got a scab on it. Don&#8217;t burn down a library to fix a typo.</strong></a></p>
<h1>All your problems are small</h1>
<p>■「部分的な問題を全体視しない」<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t globalize a local problem&#8221;<br />
部分的＝ぶぶんてき<br />
全体視＝ぜんたいし<br />
問題＝もんだい<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re having trouble with your Japanese. Doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re stupid. Doesn&#8217;t mean Japanese is stupid or too hard. It just means you have some cogs in the immersion/SRS machine that need fixing.</p>
<p>■「天才は有限なれど努力は無限なり」<br />
&#8220;Genius is finite. Hard work is infinite&#8221;<br />
天才＝てんさい<br />
有限＝ゆうげん<br />
努力＝どりょく<br />
Genius, if it even exists, will only take you so far. &#8220;Hard work&#8221; &#8212; i.e. persistence, tenacity and experimentation &#8212; will take you everywhere.</p>
<p>■「短期的な問題を永続化しない」<br />
&#8220;Never eternalize a short-term problem&#8221;<br />
短期的＝たんきてき<br />
永続化＝えいぞくか<br />
問題＝もんだい<br />
This advice applies to both the suicidal and the infanctidal. Think of history, Makoto advises, think of the history of our planet, of the entire universe. On this scale, all your problems are just a speck of dust. Sucking at something is a natural — but temporary — state. It can only become permanent if we choose to make it so. Once we starve the child to death, whatever food we throw at her thereafter shall be of no use. We often run away when we suck. But maybe that’s exactly when we should be staying.<a href="https://goo.gl/SFDbBJ"> Just as no animal needs its parents’ attention more than when it’s a baby, you, a virtual (but very real) Japanese baby, need all the Japanese you can get right here, right now, right when you suck, precisely because you suck</a>&#8230;You need Japanese and you need it badly. In fact, you need it more than a “real” Japanese person does: they’ve had their fill; they can wait.&#8221;</p>
<h1>Don&#8217;t compare, don&#8217;t despair</h1>
<p>■「他人と比べる事に意味は無い。」<br />
&#8220;Comparing yourself to other people is meaningless.&#8221;<br />
他人＝たにん<br />
比べる＝くらべる<br />
意味＝いみ<br />
Nobody is better than you. Nobody is worse than you. They&#8217;re just different.</p>
<p>■「間違えて恥をかく場を自ら進んでつくる・・・恥をかく事を恐れない」<br />
&#8220;Find, create and go to places where you will be shamed&#8230;do not fear shame.&#8221;<br />
間違える＝まちがえる<br />
恥＝はじ<br />
場＝ば<br />
Get your shame in now. Get it out of the way now, while you&#8217;re practicing, so you won&#8217;t have to deal with it later. Don&#8217;t be afraid to look and sound bad at Japanese in front of your SRS, while shadowing by yourself, or in front of people who are able and willing to correct you.</p>
<p>■「『人の目を気にしない』事は、『続ける』為のとても重要なノウハウ」<br />
&#8220;Not giving a crap what people think is an important part of the power continue&#8221;<br />
目＝め<br />
人＝ひと<br />
為＝ため<br />
When you don&#8217;t care, you can grow. You can shamelessly do the basics &#8212; you don&#8217;t need to (seem to) be awesome already. You can shamelessly practice <em>kanji</em>, shamelessly shadow, shamelessly ask questions, shamelessly receive correction. And, ironically, that&#8217;s exactly the type of attitude that will ultimately make you truly awesome.</p>
<h1>Never, never, never, never, never, never&#8230;</h1>
<p>■「最後まで絶対に諦めない」<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t quit. Never quit.&#8221;<br />
最後＝さいご<br />
迄＝まで<br />
諦める＝あきらめる<br />
It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s it for now. This entire book is one long, amazing quote and my copy is underlined (red pen, baby) up the wazoo. I would basically have to type out the entire book in order to share it with you. Not gonna do that. That kind of copyright infringement is not the point of this exercise. So we&#8217;re gonna leave it here.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/29JUAE9">Go get the book </a>if you&#8217;re interested and want more goodness &#8212; there is a Kindle version if you like to keep things digital all the way. Personally, I prefer to buy physical books and then get them converted into PDFs by services like <a href="http://densika.com" class="autohyperlink">densika.com</a> and 1dollarscan; despite the extra time delay it&#8217;s just a superior reading experience; Kindle books are better than nothing, but also actually kinda slow, buggy and generally schyte compared to what they could be. But more on that another time, perhaps in an article on creating and maintaining a Japanese reading environment <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can a dancer teach you about learning languages?</p>
<p>As it turns out, just about everything.</p>
<p>Twyla Tharp. It&#8217;s not a household name. In fact, whenever I hear it, I picture Tilda Swinton &#8212; another woman lots of T&#8217;s in her name and very little fat on her body.</p>
<p>&#8230;Just sayin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out they look <em>nothing</em> like each other, but that&#8217;s not the point. The point is, years ago, way back in about 2003 &#8212; for perspective, that&#8217;s before President Obama was even a Senator &#8212; Twyla Tharp wrote a book called &#8220;The Creative Habit&#8221;.</p>

<li>and here&#8217;s the (original) English version: <a href="http://amzn.to/29JSep4">[The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life: Twyla Tharp, Mark Reiter: 9780743235273: Amazon.com: Books]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So, years ago, she wrote this book.<br />
And years ago, I bought it.<br />
And years ago, I read it.</p>
<p>But only now am I sharing its profound insights and boundless wisdom with you, because, well, I like to let things ruminate like that.</p>
<p>This book has been&#8230;I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a word for it in English&#8230;at the risk of sounding corny, a constant and quiet source of grounding and inspiration for me, and I think it could be that for you, too. And not the &#8220;rah! rah! go git &#8217;em Tiger&#8221; sort of loud and violent inspiration, but the understated, slow-cooking, simmering kind. The kind that&#8217;s <em>not</em> like the movies, because it lasts a heckuva lot longer than a ten-minute montage. The kind that moves you to do the one and only thing that can make you great: to continue.</p>
<p>Speaking of continuing, there&#8217;s actually an entire (almost) 200-page Japanese book about just that. It&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; classic. We won&#8217;t talk about it today, but we will get into it some other time &#8212; in English, just to make it easier for you. For now, though, here&#8217;s a link so we can put a little pin in that thought: [<a href="http://amzn.to/29JUAE9">The Power of Continuing: The Royal Road to Success in Work and Study by Makoto ITOU / 続ける力―仕事・勉強で成功する王道 (幻冬舎新書) | 伊藤 真 | 本 | Amazon.co.jp</a>]
<p>And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming!</p>
<p>In my not-so-humble opinion, Tharp has produced one of the greatest books ever written not just on dance and creativity, but on learning itself. Like many such books (and many such people) <strong>she&#8217;s done that thing where you get so deeply and narrowly into one field that your mind opens up, and you see the entire Universe in a grain of sand, so to speak.</strong></p>
<p>Twyla Tharp &#8212; yes, that&#8217;s her real, gubmit name that her parents gave her &#8212; has been dancing and choreographing professionally for some fifty years, and she hasn&#8217;t been sleeping on the job or resting on her laurels. The lady just keeps on going. She is to dance as Leni Riefenstahl is to film: relentlessly badass, a lifelong innovator, and nearly immortal. Unlike Leni, however, she&#8217;s not a Nazi sympathizer. This is a good thing.</p>
<p>What the f<br />
Oh yeah!</p>
<p>So, she writes this book, blah blah blah&#8230;And it can help you learn languages! Enough talk, let&#8217;s dig right in! Unless otherwise stated, everything in quotes will be words of wisdom from Twyla. And everything not in quotes will be analysis and commentary from the Khatzumoto.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let go of magical beliefs. There is only one &#8220;gift&#8221; in this world, and that is the fact of being alive and thus being able to work. Where and when you were born do not matter &#8212; it&#8217;s just plain silly to focus on the country you were born in and forget about the planet and universe you were born into. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/max-out-the-cause-card/">This is a universe where you, of your own free will, can produce causes that produce effects</a>. What you do is what will make you who you are. Greatness is made, not born: <em>&#8220;&#8230;a philosophical tug of war will periodically rear its head. It is the perennial debate, born in the Romantic era, between the beliefs that all creative acts are born of (a) some transcendent, inexplicable Dionysian act of inspiration, a kiss from God on your brow that allows you to give the world The Magic Flute, or (b) hard work. If it isn’t obvious already, I come down on the side of hard work.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>You don&#8217;t learn a language, you get used to it: <em>&#8220;&#8230;[language skill is created] by routine and habit. Get used to it. [Language skill] is a habit, and the best [language skill] is a result of good&#8230;habits. That’s it in a nutshell.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>It&#8217;s all about preparation. If you want to eat the sweet fruit of language ability, you must prepare beforehand. It&#8217;s not good signing up for some shiz and then panicking at the last moment. Language skill is brutally and scrupulously just. If you want to reap, you must sow:<em> &#8220;In order to be creative you have to&#8230;prepare to be creative.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>Starting is more important than finishing. If you just start &#8212; show up &#8212; every day; finishing will take care of itself. In exercise terms, the trick is not to go to the gym, the trick is to get outside with your shoes on: <em>&#8220;I begin each day of my life with a ritual; I wake up at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweatshirts, and my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st street and First Avenue, where I work out for two hours. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone/">The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual.</a></em>&#8221;  <a class="simple-footnote" title="Set appearance/situational/environmental goals rather than action/completion goals. Rather than setting a goal to do the right thing, set a goal to be in the right place. You don’t have to run tomorrow morning. You just have to have your shoes on and be standing outside." id="return-note-30720-1" href="#note-30720-1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>You don&#8217;t learn the language, you get used to it. A language is not a &#8220;skill&#8221; (even though we often call it one, for convenience), but a habit, a way of life. If you want to change your language ability, change your way of life: <em>&#8220;It’s vital to establish&#8230;rituals &#8212; automatic but decisive patterns of behavior&#8230;[in order to prevent] turning back, chickening out, giving up, or going the wrong way.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>In case you didn&#8217;t get the message yet: <em>&#8220;There are no &#8220;natural&#8221; geniuses.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>You are never too old, too young, too early, too late, too bad or too good to use an SRS. Surusu, Anki, Mnemosyne, SuperMemo, Memrise. Which one you use doesn&#8217;t matter. Just use one erry day: <em>&#8220;The great ones never take fundamentals for granted.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>You are never too good for practice. You will never be too good for practice. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/before-fluency-after-fluency/">Before enlightenment</a>: chop wood, carry water. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/khatz-if-youre-fluent-why-do-you-still-srs/">After enlightenment</a>: chop wood, carry water. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-many-languages-abandoning-a-language-after-bad-experiences/">A lot of people act like &#8212; and sincerely believe &#8212; that you can &#8220;learn&#8221; a language and then somehow be done with it. That&#8217;s so untrue it&#8217;s not even funny. You will never be done</a>. You will get better; you will stop sucking, but you will never be &#8220;done&#8221;. The moment you&#8217;re &#8220;done&#8221; (or think you are) is the moment you start sucking. This game is forever. The internal sub-games are finite, but the game itself is forever. It&#8217;s for fun. It&#8217;s for keeps. And it&#8217;s forever, because: <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong><em>&#8220;you have to work as hard to protect your skills as you did to develop them. This means vigilant practice and excellent practice habits&#8221;</em></strong></span>. That right there is central dogma. If this article could only be one sentence long, that would be the sentence.</li>
<li>Copy first, create later. The cool thing about learning (=getting used to) a language is that you don&#8217;t have to invent or create a damn thing. In fact, inventing and creating is exactly what you mustn&#8217;t do. Speaking and writing a language is 99.999999% copying exactly what native speakers say and write, and 0.000001% creating new combinations on your own. It&#8217;s also about 90~95% input to 5%~10% output. In fact, when you first get started, it&#8217;s 100% input. So: <em>&#8220;&#8230;get busy copying. That&#8217;s not a popular notion today, not when we are all instructed to find our own way, admonished to be original and find our own voice at all costs! But it&#8217;s sound advice. Traveling the paths of greatness, even in someone else&#8217;s footprints, is a vital means to acquiring skill.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>If you want to be creative, stop creating. Not forever, just for a really, really long time. If you want to be good at Japanese, stop making stuff up. Don&#8217;t be original. Copy. Your copying style will be your originality. Your originality and creativity will bubble up naturally.</li>
<li>Learn to enjoy and exploit being alone. Even social insects like bees and ants work alone a lot of the time. We live in a world and a time where people over-emphasize the importance of other people. Social media. Meetups. Groups. Forums. All that crap is nice and all, but it won&#8217;t actually help you grow the way you think it will. Ultimately, you have to go away and be alone and do some actual metaphorical lifting and literal development &#8212; and then and only then will you become a person of value to any group, a contributor rather than a moocher: <em>&#8220;Solitude is an unavoidable part of [learning]. Self-reliance is a happy by-product.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>Other (live) people are neither necessary nor sufficient for you to grow and succeed in learning a language. It&#8217;s definitely nice to have them, but you don&#8217;t need them. If you don’t have access to people, don’t let that be a mental block for you. You’ll be fine. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/no-humans-necessary-why-you-dont-need-people-to-learn-a-language/">In getting used to a language, the presence of human beings is an asset, but their absence is not a liability. Surrogate humans are more than enough</a>.</li>
<li>You rack disciprine, Grasshopper. You wanna be a hotshot? Show up. Wax on. Wax off.: <em>&#8220;Discipline. Everyone needs it. No explanation required.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>But discipline doesn&#8217;t have to be hard or painful. In fact, it&#8217;s fun &#8212; if you let it be. As David Campbell, founder of Saks Fifth Avenue so perfectly put it: <a href="http://rethinked.org/?p=3980">&#8220;Discipline is remembering what you want&#8221;</a></li>
<li>Things always look sucky in the middle of the journey away from Sucksville, not because they actually are (they&#8217;re probably better than ever) but because <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-eternal-sorrow-of-the-intermediate-learner-%E2%80%9Care-we-there-yet%E2%80%9D-syndrome/">humans, both physically and mentally, can sense acceleration (change in speed) but not absolute speed. So when you&#8217;re cruising, it seems like you&#8217;re going nowhere, even though you&#8217;re breaking new ground and making more and better ground than you&#8217;ve ever made</a>.</li>
<li>And finally, never lose hope: <em>&#8220;When you&#8217;re in a rut, you have to question everything but your ability to get out of it.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The path of excellence is infinite but the path <em>to</em> excellence is finite. Comically so. It won&#8217;t take you forever to get good at, get used to, stop sucking at Japanese &#8212; you&#8217;ll just have to spend forever <em>staying</em> good. And that&#8217;s okay, because you love the language, and there&#8217;s so much to do! What, you thought you could just build a house and never touch that bad boy again? Build a road and never repair, repave or extend it? Come on now&#8230;Be real.</p>
<p>You will get used to Japanese. You will become fluent. You will become native-like. You will become awesome. If you want to. If you choose to. You have it in you.</p>

<p>So what about you?<br />
Are you a real player?<br />
Or are you holding out for <strong>waterproof teabags to go with your bookless literacy</strong>?<br />
Come on, now.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKL_EpnSp8"> Don&#8217;t be ghetto.</a></p>
<p>Buy the books already.</p>
<p>What do you suppose your literacy would work on, even if you magically received it?<br />
You do realize that it&#8217;s a dynamic skill that grows or atrophies based on practice, right?<br />
Without books, even if you suddenly became literate, you would instantly start becoming illiterate.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t pray for rain without digging ditches.<br />
Don&#8217;t pray for literacy without buying books.<br />
That&#8217;s not faith; it&#8217;s just stupidity.</p>
<p>Speaking of faith&#8230;<br />
Would you buy a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done">lottery ticket</a>?<br />
Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t.<br />
There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_joke">10 types of people </a>and all that.</p>
<p>Would you buy a lottery ticket if you were friends with the people who run the lottery, and they were always willing and able to throw you a bone, &#8217;cause when you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;re family, badadbing <a class="simple-footnote" title="I&#8217;m doing that Tony Soprano arm thing where you make a &#8220;V&#8221; in the general direction of your crotch." id="return-note-7088-6" href="#note-7088-6"><sup>6</sup></a>? If you had that kind of influence over it?</p>
<p>Would you buy a stock if you knew &#8212; knew &#8212; beyond a shadow of a doubt <a class="simple-footnote" title="No shadows allowed! No doubt-shadows!" id="return-note-7088-7" href="#note-7088-7"><sup>7</sup></a> that it was going to go up?<br />
And how much of this stock would it be worth it to buy? How much of this stock would it not be a waste of your money to buy? All things being equal <a class="simple-footnote" title="I know&#8230;they&#8217;re not&#8230;otherwise, how do you explain how handsome I am?" id="return-note-7088-8" href="#note-7088-8"><sup>8</sup></a>, at what point is a stock that&#8217;s guaranteed to go up not a good investment?<br />
The question is its own answer.</p>
<p>Now, what about books?<br />
Are books anything like this hypothetical stock of ours?<br />
Could anyone make a claim that strong?<br />
Probably not. I don&#8217;t know.<br />
But you could at least say this: books are as close to that stock as you&#8217;re likley to get on a regular basis&#8230;without earning a royal buggering from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The stock is you. You invest in it by buying and reading books. And you&#8217;re allowed as much insider trading as you want. No one can touch you.</p>
<p>Pound for pound, word for word, a typical book is the cheapest and highest-quality information you will ever buy.</p>
<p>Buy the books already.<br />
They&#8217;ll do you a damn sight more good than beer and jeans.<br />
Buy those books, and one of these days, the books will buy you jeans&#8230;and, if Chinese proverbs are to be believed, hookers and blow and houses covered in bling as well.

<p>Baseball legend Ted Williams was one in a million, widely considered the most &#8220;gifted&#8221; hitter of his time. &#8220;I remember watching one of his home runs from the bleachers of Shibe Park,&#8221; John Updike wrote in The New Yorker in 1960. &#8220;It went over the first baseman’s head and rose meticulously along a straight line and was still rising when it cleared the fence. The trajectory seemed qualitatively different from anything anyone else might hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the public imagination, Williams was almost a god among men, a &#8220;superhuman&#8221; endowed with a collection of innate physical gifts, including spectacular eye-hand coordination, exquisite muscular grace, and uncanny instincts. &#8220;Ted just had that natural ability,&#8221; said Hall of Fame second baseman Bobby Doerr. &#8220;He was so far ahead of everybody in that era.&#8221; Among other traits, Williams was said to have laser-like eyesight, which enabled him to read the spin of a ball as it left the pitcher’s fingers and to gauge exactly where it would pass over the plate. &#8220;Ted Williams sees more of the ball than any man alive,&#8221; Ty Cobb once remarked.</p>
<p><span style="color: #3366ff;">But <strong>all that innate miracle-man stuff—it was all &#8220;a lot of bull,&#8221; said Williams</strong>. He insisted his great <strong>achievements were simply the sum of what he had put into the game</strong>. &#8220;Nothing except practice, practice, practice will bring out that ability,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The reason I saw things was that I was so intense … It was [super] <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/automated-discipline-how-to-keep-new-years-resolutions-and-stay-on-track-all-the-time">discipline</a>, not super eyesight.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Is that possible? Could <strong>a perfectly ordinary man actually train himself to be a dazzling phenomenon</strong>? We all recognize the virtues of practice and hard work, but truly, could any amount of effort transform the clunky motions of a whiffer or a chucker into the majestic swing of Tiger Woods or the gravity-defying leap of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/showing-up">Michael Jordan</a>? Could an ordinary brain ever expand enough to conjure the far-flung curiosities and visions of Einstein or Matisse? Is true greatness obtainable from everyday means and everyday genes?</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom says no, that some people are simply born with certain gifts while others are not; that talent and high intelligence are somewhat scarce gems, scattered throughout the human gene pool; that the best we can do is to locate and polish these gems—and accept the limitations built into the rest of us.</p>
<p>But someone forgot to tell Ted Williams that talent will out. As a boy, he wasn’t interested in watching his natural abilities unfurl passively like a flower in the sunshine. He simply wanted—needed—to be the best hitter baseball had ever seen, and he pursued that goal with appropriate <strong>ferocity. &#8220;His whole life was hitting the ball</strong>,&#8221; recalled a boyhood friend. &#8220;He always had that bat in his hand … And when he made up his mind to do something, he was going to do it or know the reason why.&#8221;</p>
<p>At San Diego’s old North Park field, two blocks from his modest childhood home, friends recall Williams <strong>hitting baseballs every waking hour of every day, year after year after year</strong>. They describe him slugging balls until their outer shells literally wore off, <strong>swinging even splintered bats for hours upon hours with blisters on his fingers and blood dripping down his wrists</strong>. A working-class kid with no extra pocket change, he used his own lunch money to hire schoolmates to shag balls so that he could keep swinging. From age six or seven, he would swing the bat at North Park field all day and night, swing until the city turned off the lights; then he’d walk home and swing a roll of newspaper in front of a mirror until he fell asleep. The next day, he’d do it all over again. Friends say he attended school only to play on the team. When baseball season ended and the other kids moved on to basketball and football, Williams stuck with baseball. When other boys started dating girls, Williams just kept hitting balls in North Park field. In order to strengthen his sight, he would walk down the street with one eye covered, and then the other. He even avoided movie theaters because he’d heard it was bad for the eyes. &#8220;I wasn’t going to let anything stop me from being the hitter I hoped to be,&#8221; Williams later recalled. &#8220;Looking back … it was pretty near storybook devotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, he worked for it, fiercely, single-mindedly, far beyond the norm. &#8220;He had one thought in mind and he always followed it,&#8221; said his high school coach Wos Caldwell.</p>
<p>Greatness was not a thing to Ted Williams; it was a process.</p>
<p>This didn’t stop after he got drafted into professional baseball. In Williams’s first season with the minor league San Diego Padres, coach Frank Shellenback noticed that his new recruit was always the first to show up for practice in the morning and the last to leave at night. And something more curious: after each game, Williams would ask the coach for the used game balls.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you do with all these baseballs?&#8221; Shellenback finally asked Williams one day. &#8220;Sell them to kids in the neighborhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No sir,&#8221; replied Williams. &#8220;I use them for a little extra hitting practice after supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Knowing the rigors of a full practice day, Shellenback found the answer hard to swallow. Out of a mix of suspicion and curiosity, he later recalled, &#8220;I piled into my car after supper [one night] and rode around to Williams’s neighborhood. There was a playground near his home, and sure enough, I saw The Kid himself driving those two battered baseballs all over the field. Ted was standing close to a rock which served as [home] plate. One kid was pitching to him. A half dozen others were shagging his drives. The stitching was already falling apart on the baseballs I had [just] given him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even among the pros, Williams’s <strong>intensity</strong> stood so far outside the norm that it was often <strong>uncomfortable to witness up close. &#8220;He discussed the science of hitting ad nauseam</strong> with teammates and opposing players,&#8221; write biographers Jim Prime and Bill Nowlin. &#8220;He sought out the great hitters of the game—Hornsby, Cobb, and others—and grilled them about their techniques.&#8221;</p>
<p>He studied pitchers with the same rigor. &#8220;[After a while], pitchers figure out [batters’] weaknesses,&#8221; said Cedric Durst, who played on the Padres with Williams. &#8220;Williams wasn’t like that … Instead of them figuring Ted out, he figured them out. The first time Ted saw [Tony] Freitas pitch, we were sitting side by side on the bench and Ted said, ‘This guy won’t give me a fast ball I can hit. He’ll waste the fast ball and try to make me hit the curve. He’ll get behind on the count, then throw me the curve.’ And that’s exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong>. After a decade of <strong>relentless effort</strong> on North Park field, and four impressive years in the minors, Williams came into the major leagues in 1939 as an explosive hitter and just kept getting better and better and better. In 1941, his third season with the Boston Red Sox, he became the only major league player in his era—and the last in the twentieth century—to bat over .400 for a full season.</p>
<p>The next year, 1942, Ted Williams enlisted in the navy as an aviator. Tests revealed his <strong>vision</strong> to be excellent, but <strong>well within ordinary human range</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Simple ideas but expressed in an insightful way that feels really fresh</li>
<li>Clear writing</li>
<li>Has this really cool, textured cover</li>
<li>Touches on concepts like timeboxing and Parkinson&#8217;s Law, but without naming them</li>
<li>Perfect antidote to the perfectionism masquerading as professionalism/maturity that seems to be eating away at so many people nowadays</li>
<li>NAKAI is kind. You know how<a href="http://amzn.to/9SWoBy"> some business authors are mean because they think it&#8217;s cool</a>? Yeah, he&#8217;s not like that.</li>
<li>The first two-thirds of the book is pure gold. The final third isn&#8217;t as good, but that&#8217;s fine because all the lameness is sequestered over there, leaving the vast majority of the book pristine.</li>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t beat you over the head with its titular &#8220;habits&#8221;, quite unlike certain plodding, <a href="http://amzn.to/c6s5fN">quasi-theological business books</a> that shall remain nameless. OK that was mean. But seriously&#8230;that book should have been a pamphlet. Freakin&#8217; a.</li>
<li>Judicious use of images and highlighting &#8212; in keeping with the illustrious traditions of the modern Japanese business book.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<ul>
<li>Assumes that you work at a company</li>
<li>The ideas are so simple that it&#8217;s tempting to ignore the book</li>
<li>The final third of the book is a bit too focussed on specific tools &#8212; Gmail, iPhone, iPod touch &#8212; with usage suggestions that are (1) not at all fresh, and (2) only tangentially related to the core ideas of the book, which are fresh.
<ul>
<li>It all just seems unnecessarily trendy to me. In fact, I feel like it actually just lowers the timelessness and universality of the book. It adds pages, but not value. In other words, it&#8217;s filler. Fortunately, it all comes at the end, where it can&#8217;t mar the rest of the book.</li>
<li>I imagine that this travesty was probably an idea of the publisher&#8217;s rather than the author&#8217;s. 2010 has been a banner year for Japanese business books centered around how artifacts like the iPhone and cloud services like Gmail and DropBox will cure cancer, increase nighttime stamina and make you more productive than an ant on speed.
<ul>
<li>All us geeks know in our hearts of hearts that while tools like the iPhone are great fun to play around with, they rarely actually help (of course there are major exceptions, like SRS &#8212; a smartphone is worth it for the mobile SRS capability alone). In many crucial ways, these toys are yet to match the speed, reliability and resilience of good old BallPointPen and A4Paper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IMHO, it comes down to this: the key to being awesome possum is almost always lies in mindset rather than tools. A new PDA will not make it all better. Being mindful of Parkinson&#8217;s Law, on the other hand, will. A good tool with the wrong mindset is just a waste of plastic and minor precious metals.</li>

I believed this lie for the greater part of my youth. But I think that I had a good reason for believing it: the alternative was well-meaning adults who tell you to &#8220;just suck it up&#8221;. **** you. If that worked so well, I&#8217;d be doing it, wouldn&#8217;t I?Here&#8217;s the thing: the key to being awesome, the key to so-called productivity, is not the tools, but an understanding of human behavior &#8212; yours. Once we understand human behavior, we can, as we say in Japanese &#8220;<a href="http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/10092/m0u/%E6%B4%BB%E3%81%8B%E3%81%99/">give life</a>&#8221; to the tools. In other words, tools are helpful and useful only in proportion to the user&#8217;s ability to use them and not be used by them.</p>
<p>So, SRS in the wrong hands creates burnout, a Franklin Planner in the wrong hands is just expensive leather binding and refills (actually, a Franklin Planner in the <em>right</em> hands is just expensive leather binding and refills, but&#8230;yeah), a PDA in the wrong hands is just an overpriced mini-touchscreen.</p>
<p>A person who knows about the <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%91%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%95%E5%89%87">Pareto Principle</a>, <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BD%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%95%E5%89%87">Parkinson&#8217;s Law</a>, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games">Temporal Motivation Theory</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=skinner+operant+conditioning&amp;aq=0">Operant Conditioning</a> &#8212; even if she doesn&#8217;t know these concepts by name &#8212; this is a person who&#8217;s ready for tools. But&#8230;here is the irony &#8212; as your understanding of human behavior goes up, your need to amass tools goes down.</p>
<p>Tools definitely can and do help. I&#8217;m a happy user of many of them. But they really only help at all when and because they magnify the existing mindset of the user. Give a scatterbrained, overworked perfectionist an iPhone, and what you create is a scatterbrained, overworked perfectionist&#8230;with an iPhone. Reminds me of the famous Mojo Jojo quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was once a vengeful mad genius bent on destroying the world. But now I&#8217;m a vengeful mad genius bent on destroying the world&#8230;with super powers!&#8221; ~ Mojo Jojo of <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em>, commenting immediately after his acquisition of super powers</p></blockquote>
<p>Um&#8230;I forgot what I was actually talking about. Oh yeah, this book. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool. The first two thirds give you the mental tools to use the physical tools introduced in the final third. The concrete suggestions in the final third of the book aren&#8217;t as bad as I made them out to be earlier in this review; it&#8217;s just, I guess&#8230;I&#8217;m tired of iPhone-and-Gmail books. I mean&#8230;dayom. Way to skirt the core issues.</p>
<p>OK, in keeping with the growing tradition of these book reviews (lots of tradition to keep today), let me pull out a couple of pearls of wisdom I picked up from this bad boy:</p>
<ul>
<li>準備するから遅くなる： You run late <em>because </em>you prepare. Stop preparing and just start doing something.</li>
<li>「大きな一歩」にこだわるから、スタート出来ない。「小さな一歩」なら、頑張らなくても踏み出せる：You run late <em>because</em> you try to take big steps. If you take small steps, if you just inch your way there, you won&#8217;t even have to try.</li>
<li>時間にルーズな相手からの電話を待ってはいけない：Don&#8217;t wait for phone calls from people who don&#8217;t keep time.</li>
<li>文章は、出出しの1行を考えるのに時間が掛かる。2行目から始めれば、直ぐに書ければ：It takes a long time to learn write that first line. Don&#8217;t even bother. Just start writing from the second line!
<ul>
<li>This is genius writing advice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>記念日にこだわるから遅くなる。「今日」を記念日にす[る]：Waiting for special days makes you late. Make today the special day.</li>
<li>タイムリミットは、早ければ早いほどいい：The lower the time limit, the better. The less time you have, the better.</li>
<li>「期日の無い仕事」が、「いそがしい」「仕事が終わらない」の元凶：Work that has no deadline is the source of that overworked, overbusy feeling.
<ul>
<li>Parkinson&#8217;s Law. Right here, baby. Work expanding infinitely to fill infinite available time. This is <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done">why people who have all the time in the world never get anything done</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>「迷ったら捨てる」を鉄則に：If in doubt, throw it out.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s it from me. Sorry for this sucky, pedestrian review. The book itself is really cool, though, so&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></td>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/bly6A1">1-Minute Email-Fu | Quick, Concise, Chronically Awesome Japanese Business Email Examples For People Who Think Too Much</a></p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/bly6A1">KAMIGAKI Ayumi</a></td>
<td valign="top" width="40%">
<ul>
<li>This book is so good that Hiroshi (fake name), one of my good Japanese friends (who went to Waseda &#8212; the Princeton of Japan &#8212; and happens to be a bureaucrat) <em>stole</em> it from me and took it to his office to use at work! I had to keep bugging this kid for <em>days</em> on end just to get it grudgingly returned so I could write this review.</li>
<li>No, really, <em>stole</em>. He borrowed it without my permission. We regularly share books with each other. But this one he simply nabbed.</li>
<li>Examples are situation-based, easy to look up.</li>
<li>Very clear writing and formatting.</li>
<li>Contains examples that you simply <em>can&#8217;t find</em> online. Frankly, all the online Japanese business email guides I have seen so far are <em>crap</em>. Too wordy, too complex, too presumptuous (I don&#8217;t make factory goods!): they simply don&#8217;t cover the right situations in the right way.</li>
<li>Kamigaki also has another email book out called <a href="http://amzn.to/aTLhjg">メールは1分で返しなさい</a>. I haven&#8217;t actually seen it yet, but if this bad boy is anything to go by, then it&#8217;s probably full of awesome.</li>
<li>Written by a Japanese person for Japanese people. So you know she keeps it real. This is actual contemporary Japanese: not the anachronistic, overpolite Japanese that prissy, opinionated, undersexed schoolmarms<em> </em>insist on trying to force foreigners to use. People who&#8217;ve taken a Japanese class know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="40%">
<ul>
<li>No digital version. I mean, come on &#8212; this is email! <em>Electronic</em> mail. An <em>electronic</em> version just makes good sense. Especially since Kamigaki encourages readers to use her examples <em>as is</em>. I&#8217;d love to SRS the pants off her&#8230;book.</li>
<li>This is kind of like how computer science/ engineering students in college are often lugging around these <a href="http://amzn.to/cdJQBH">super heavy textbooks</a> when they should be the very ones pioneering electronic books.</li>
<li>Come <a href="http://on...com" class="autohyperlink">on&#8230;com</a>puter scientists (1) carrying books that are (2) even heavier than the humanities students?</li>
<li>That&#8217;s not a typo. Computer science textbooks usually weigh more than a humanities student.</li>

<td colspan="3" valign="top" width="100%"><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data//emailfu.png"><img class="right" title="emailfu" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data//emailfu-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>There isn&#8217;t actually much to say about this book other than it&#8217;s a great email reference. Examples are arranged thematically. See that picture of the sample page? Almost the entire book is structured this way &#8212; full example email on one page, discussion of key phrases on the other.Let me, I guess, share, by way of illustrative example, how this book has helped me. Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve done a lot of translation work (since that&#8217;s something easy and fun <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;source=hp&amp;q=%E5%9C%A8%E5%AE%85%E7%BF%BB%E8%A8%B3">you can do from home</a> or anywhere else &#8212; perfect for both hermit and nomad). Sometimes I would need to turn down project offers (and I did start getting a lot &lt;/blowingownhorn&gt;), especially when I was scaling down to concentrate on other things.</p>
<p>Now, the thing about turning down work is that anyone can be all &#8220;I&#8217;m busy!&#8221;. But to communicate the idea that &#8220;you have honored me with your request and with the time it took you to contact me, I can&#8217;t work on this project right now but maybe another time&#8221;, and to do so with neither arrogance nor ambiguity nor excess humility nor verbosity? That, friends, is the big email question, as it were: <strong>how do you say &#8220;no&#8221; nicely </strong><strong><em>and</em></strong><strong> firmly?</strong></p>
<p>I mean, I&#8217;m probably overthinking all of this; I&#8217;m almost certainly overthinking it&#8230;but&#8230;anyway, that example up there (the sample page) from this book showed me how to do that. How to turn things down in such a way that both sides both feel good and get the message &#8212; clarity, <strong>concision</strong>, good feelings. Hiroshi liked it; I liked it; you&#8217;ll like it, too.</p>
<p>Random aside: a lot of Japanese etiquette originates from a time when life was slower and speed was considered rude; in fact, in traditional letter-writing, one would apologize for writing letters that were too short &#8212; particularly thank-you letters. Now, of course, speed is considered essential, but so is politeness. You need to be polite <em>quickly</em>. There&#8217;s no time to say the stuff that comes after &#8220;こんにちは&#8221;. This, I think, is a big part of what causes many Japanese people and people who simply run Japanese software &#8212; like you and I &#8212; to think too much when writing email; they&#8217;re trying to balance all these things.</p>
<p><em>1-Minute Email-Fu</em> will help you learn to write concise, effective, clear, polite, dignified Japanese business emails. It&#8217;ll save you time and brain cycles. I&#8217;m very proud of myself for having found it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . It&#8217;s that simple.</td>

<td width="10%" valign="top">Comments</td>
<td width="90%" valign="top">It’s good to get back to the basics now   and then and to have a lot of what many people already knew/suspected about   the brain and learning (sleep = good, repetition = good, stress = bad)   reinforced in one, solid, authoritative place.</p>
<p>Fluffy newspaper articles   written by people who don’t actually know what they’re talking about (often <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060331153945.htm">touting   the latest poorly done research that somehow demonstrates that <em>it may actually be better </em>to avoid   sleep, eat more chocolate and drink more alcohol</a>) can get old fast.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/dcRqc3"><img class="right" title="Brain Rules" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data//51hn8QhdjGL._SS500_1.jpg" alt="Brain Rules" width="300" height="300" /></a><br />
Medina’s passionate call for workplace   and school reform (allow owls to work at night and larks to work in the   morning; make information interesting and exciting to the senses; be kind and   gentle to people – don’t use fear and intimidation; repeat important   information) is a refreshing appeal to sanity and something that more people   need to hear, take seriously, and actually implement.</p>
<p>I especially enjoyed Dr. Medina’s memory   advice:<strong> <a href="http://brainrules.net/the-rules">“Remember to repeat. Repeat to remember.”</a></strong> His observation that there’s actually far too little repetition going on in   schools really hit home for me. I wonder if the good doctor knows about <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-is-an-srs">SRS</a>, because   he should totally get all up on that.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m of the opinion that in   many countries and in most cases, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling">school does more harm than   good and we’d be better off without it</a>, or with a radically reduced,   elective version of it. Certainly, we could do better than the glorified   prisons we have now. Compulsory schooling: fail. Libraries: win. But…yeah,   anyway.</p>
<p>The <strong>DVD   was a great addition to the book. Simple and humorous</strong>, it was a gratifying example of someone actually following his own advice (“we don&#8217;t pay attention   to boring things”, “[to learn better,] stimulate more of the senses”).</p>
<p>Like I said, the book was a bit   long-winded for me: it feels like it could have gotten to the point much   quicker than it did. Coming from me, that really is the pot calling the   kettle black, so…deal with the irony as you will, hehe. <strong>Personally, I got the most out of the DVD and website. </strong>So if you   do get the book, get it for the DVD. <a href="http://amzn.to/act1Oz">You   could also <strong>get the audiobook</strong></a> (currently only available in English, AFAIK) and play it at high speed or   something.</p>
<p>I’ve never actually read the English   version of the book, so it could be that this is a case where the translator   didn’t have time to chew the book down into smooth, fluid Japanese. Those who   know, know that English can sound very belabored and heavy-handed when   translated semi-literally into Japanese. (Translators are sometimes rushed   into producing work that doesn’t reflect the full extent of their abilities:   I speak from professional experience. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a question of malice, it&#8217;s just that a lot of people &#8212; even within the translation industry &#8212; don&#8217;t realize that a good translator doesn&#8217;t simply convert text, but rewrites and re-interprets it).</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m definitely <strong>looking forward to seeing, hearing and   reading more from Dr. Medina</strong> in the future. His is a voice that needs to   be heard.</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Random aside: my friend Eisuke and I were   wondering why audiobooks aren’t as common in Japan   as they are in the US.   We concluded that it must be because so many people use trains here.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">While people in rural areas move   primarily by car, all Japan’s   major urban centers have excellent public transportation networks up and   running. You’ll notice that people in trains are always busy reading   newspapers, manga, and </span><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E5%BA%AB%E6%9C%AC"><span style="color: #999999;">bunkobons</span></a><span style="color: #999999;">,   so there’s simply not as much absolute need for non-text books.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;">Having said that, reading in a packed   train can kind of suck a bit, even with a bunkobon. So I’m sure audiobooks   would be a welcome development. I know I’d be all over it. I used to </span><em><span style="color: #999999;">hate</span></em><span style="color: #999999;"> audiobooks, thinking they were   for idiots who couldn’t read. And slow audiobooks still annoy the heck out of   me, but </span><em><span style="color: #999999;">high-speed</span></em><span style="color: #999999;"> audiobooks are   right up there with kittens and tall women.</span></td>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The QRG video has arrived! The QRG video, nicknamed &#8220;QRG: The Movie&#8221; is a video supplement to the best-selling ebook of similar name &#8212; the quick-start, action-oriented, no-nonsense AJATT <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/qrg-version-10-is-here" target="_blank">Quick Reference Guide (QRG)</a>.</p>
<p>As is the custom here at AJATT, let me be the very first to tell you precisely and in no uncertain words:</p>
<h2>Why You Don&#8217;t Need The QRG Video And Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Buy It</h2>
<ul>
<li>No special effects</li>
<li>No hot chicks</li>
<li>No hot guys</li>
<li>No hot anything, really</li>
<li>My Mum says I&#8217;m handsome, but does that really count?</li>
<li>No 3D animation</li>
<li>No popcorn</li>
<li>In the background, you can still see the tape marks from when I used to try to prevent my cats opening doors (those clever motherlovers&#8230;)</li>
<li>No batteries included</li>
<li>I hadn&#8217;t shaved</li>
<li>My posture was bad</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a monologue</li>
<li>There&#8217;s virtually no Japanese in it.</li>
<li>Which is pretty funny for a site called &#8220;All Japanese All The Time&#8221;.</li>
<li>Wanna know what&#8217;s even more funny?</li>
<li>日本語を全く解さない癖に一々「アイツのホームページはさぁ、やっぱ日本語足りないんだよね」とかホザいてる馬鹿野郎が</li>
<li>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s freaking funny.</li>
<li>百年早いぞｺﾉﾔﾛｰ</li>
<li>There&#8217;s lots of mumbling and rambling. To quote Tolkien verbatim: things were mumbled that shouldn&#8217;t have been mumbled.</li>
<li>At one point in the video, I inexplicably feel the need to tell you that I read a lot of books &#8212; intellectual small man syndrome, hmmm?</li>
<li>I have a weird, hard-to-place, mid-Atlanticy accent thing going on that is neither here nor there, and thus, ultimately, hard for <em>everyone</em> to understand.</li>
<li>I then take this accent and mumble in it.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s full of unfunny jokes.</li>
<li>That I then laugh at.</li>
<li>Yes, I laugh at my own jokes.</li>
<li>You could just read the AJATT site.</li>
<li>You could just read the QRG ebook.</li>
<li>&#8220;They&#8221; (<em>air quotes</em>) don&#8217;t want you to have it.</li>
<li>A good number of fellow AJATTeers have put up free AJATT walkthroughs on YouTube. For free. For free, meng.</li>
<li>It comes with free membership in the AJATT cult wait&#8230;baby steps&#8230;baby steps&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object width="425" height="344" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jizmD_Yr10s&amp;hl=ja&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="425" height="344" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jizmD_Yr10s&amp;hl=ja&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<h2>So Who <em>Would</em> Want To Buy The QRG Video?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong> </strong>People who bought, enjoyed and benefited from the QRG ebook</li>
<li>People who have enjoyed and benefited from previous AJATT videos</li>
<li>People who have read, enjoyed and benefited from AJATT articles</li>
<li>People looking for a lazy, &#8220;hands-free&#8221; but action-oriented overview of the AJATT &#8220;method&#8221;</li>
<li>People who prefer verbal explanations.</li>
<li>People who prefer watching a video to reading large amounts of text</li>
<li>People who want to get right to the AJATT &#8220;action&#8221; without wading through large amounts of interesting but &#8220;less action-oriented&#8221; individual.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AJATT site, this site, has grown into a compendium of brilliantly insightful articles written by an incredibly handsome man. This is a good thing. The one weakness is that, well, it&#8217;s all very large, and can tend to leave you wondering &#8220;OK, but what do I DO?&#8221;.</p>
<p>The QRG series has been designed to fulfill the specific need to &#8220;get straight to the action&#8221;, without sacrificing the more universal and context-independent appeal of many of the articles you typically find here on the site.</p>
<p>Some things are best read, some things are best heard, some things are best said and heard. The QRG video, in combination with the QRG ebook, covers all these bases for you. One of the coolest parts of the video, I think, is the oral walkthrough of the entire AJATT &#8220;philosophy&#8221; (AKA &#8220;mental tools&#8221;) section.</p>
<p>Over and above that is the &#8220;greater than the some of its parts&#8221; effect, that inexplicable magic you get in a video that text can never quite replicate. This video is a lot like sitting with me, in my &#8220;Fortress of Solitude&#8221;, having a conversation. If that&#8217;s something you would enjoy, then I think you might enjoy this video as well.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s In The Package?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two video files &#8212; digital downloads
<ul>
<li>one <em>with</em> background music</li>
<li>one without BGM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WMV format.</li>
<li>File size: Approx. 425MB</li>
<li>Running time: 81 minutes</li>
<li>All the points in the QRG are covered with sparkling wit and verve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For best results, I recommend you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the QRG ebook</strong> as well, if you don&#8217;t already have it. This video is designed to be used in combination with the QRG ebook, and assumes that you already own it.</li>
<li><strong>Be learning Japanese</strong>. This video, like the current QRG ebook, is quite specifically focussed in that direction.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Own It Now!</h2>
<p>Your copy is waiting for you. But &#8220;they&#8221; may try to take it away! So panic. Buy now. Treat yourself. You deserve this. Do something for yourself for a change! Et cetera <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>All this consulting and FAQing and emailing and commenting have taught me a thing or two. A lot of people have a lot of questions, particularly fine, detailed, low-level questions.</p>
<p>My personal preference up until now has been to write at a more abstract level, both in order to stay more universal and also in order to not bog people down with minutiae. Moreover, I hate being told what to do, and a lot of AJATT comes down to &#8220;just go out there by yourself and play&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, those action-level techniques do have a place and do have value. And, as you might expect, I&#8217;ve definitely accumulated my fair share of these over time.</p>
<p>One other thing that I&#8217;ve observed is that some people (at least claim to <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ) read through all the articles indexed over at the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency" target="_blank">Table of Contents</a>, but still come out confused as to what to do: &#8220;<strong>OK, so where do I start?</strong>&#8221; And, to be fair, I would probably be in the <em>exact same position</em> as them. There is enough information now on this site to fill hundreds, maybe even a couple thousand, pages of a normal book. There&#8217;s a lot to go through.</p>
<p>So, in my boundless magnanimity, in my universal love for humanity, in my mother-like kindness, I have taken it upon myself to use these fingers and this computer, to create magic, to create&#8230;a QRG.</p>
<p>QRG: an action-oriented, technique-focussed <strong>Quick Reference Guide</strong> to AJATT in the form of an ebook. How do you do the hirigana and the sentances and kanjis? How do you do the emersion? [sic]. How do you do use monolingual dictionaries? How do you sentence-pick? It&#8217;s <strong>AJATT condensed into a single package</strong> for AJATTeers at virtually every stage of the process, from beginners, to phase-transitioners to high-flyers looking for new games and challenges.</p>
<p>The guide itself is basically written up and ready to go, but before releasing it, I would love to part-take of your wisdom, your advice, your experiences, your requests, your suggestions. What do you need to know? What do you wish someone had told you? What would/do you as a user-reader want out of a guide like this?</p>
<p>Comments are wide open. Let your voice be heard, and cetera!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there. Been a while. Actually I just got back from Taiwan (I&#8217;m saying this in a &#8220;we do a lot of travelling&#8221; middle-class-person-showing-off-voice, by the way&#8230;this is the one where you pretend it&#8217;s no big deal to you while at the same time trying to emphasize it; I&#8217;ve worked pretty hard on this voice so I&#8217;m kind of proud of it).</p>
<p>As you know, I often project the image of a raving anti-Semite. But actually I hate people who are intolerant of other ethnicities. And the Basques.</p>
<p>The Basques.</p>
<p>Why is there a &#8220;q&#8221;? Why do they get the &#8220;special&#8221; language? Why is there Basque Freemason writing on the back of the American $5 bill?</p>
<p>Made you look!&#8230;Haha&#8230;too much Internet for <em>you</em>!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to Basque in the glory of this topic the whole day, but we have a book review to do, so let&#8217;s get started. The book is <strong>The Way of Brain Success: 猶太人の頭の中</strong>. The author is one Andrew J. Sutter. The Japanese translation is by his wife, 中村起子/NAKAMURA Kiko.</p>

</ul>
<p>Structurally, this book is quite interesting&#8230;it was written in English by the author (who&#8217;s Jewish, so&#8230;we have a good chance that he knows what he&#8217;s talking about when it comes to &#8220;Jewish stuff&#8221;), but always with the intention of publication in Japanese; AFAIK, <strong>there is no English version</strong> bar Sutter&#8217;s original manuscript. TWOBS was intended from the start to be a Japanese book, and the translation was so good that it led  one Japanese customer on Amazon.JP to comment that &#8220;it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s not even a translation&#8221;&#8230;if he knew the path to its publication, he would understand why he felt that way. So, in terms of style and audience, <strong>this is a purely Japanese book</strong>.</p>
<p>While the government of Japan refused to partake in the anti-Semitism that was terribly <em>en vogue</em> in let&#8217;s just say certain parts of Europe in the 1940s (and, well, frankly&#8230;even today on certain European island nations beginning with B and ending in ritain &#8212; at least at my high school), <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>-style judaeophobic books do exist here, unfortunately. Before everyone goes freaking out, there are also more level-headed books, like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4837907822?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4837907822" target="_blank">加瀬 英明/KASE Hideaki&#8217;s ユダヤの力/YUDAYA NO CHIKARA</a>. But the crappy books needed to be answered and Sutter was just the chap to do it.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s get into:</p>
<p><strong>Why Khatzumoto was even interested in a topic as ripe for grief, libel, slander, misunderstanding, simple crudeness, scapegoatery, scapesheepery and appalling violence, as Jewish science, I mean, success?</strong></p>
<p>For the answer to that question, you need look no further than my undergraduate experiences.</p>
<p>Experience number one. It was a computer science class in the computer science building with the best computer science professor in the world (Iowa, represent!). Outside, summer. Inside, dark. Room, dimly lit. Whiteboard, white but hard to see. Professor, really interesting as always. And he, that man, my <em>sensei</em>, said something that is probably common knowledge for everyone else, but hit me like lightning. He said that the source of the worldly success enjoyed by the Jews of Europe in the past 250 or so years, lies in the fact that the Jewish men of Europe could all do something that almost all the gentiles could not: <strong>read. </strong>Indeed, another name for the Jews is &#8220;the people of the book&#8221;. Also, &#8220;the people of the Nobel prize&#8221;.</p>
<p>Experience number two. When I was a kid, I used to read and watch TV simultaneously. Often, I&#8217;d be reading two or sometimes even three books and watching the &#8216;levision. It felt entirely natural to me but a lot of people got on my case about it (Them: &#8220;Pick one!&#8221;, Me: &#8220;No!&#8221;). Then, in 2004 I&#8217;m at a college friend&#8217;s family house and her dad is in the kitchen with magazine on the table a novel in hand and a documentary on the telly and it was like everything was warm and fuzzy because finally someone understood me and it turns out he&#8217;s Jewish which tangentially connects it to this post.</p>
<p>Indeed, these college experiences helped set the stage for my literacy &#8220;revelation&#8221;, which I <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/you-dont-have-a-foreign-language-problem-you-have-an-adult-literacy-problem" target="_blank">very verbosely shared with you here</a>. I got interested in how the Jews as a people &#8212; with exceptions, of course &#8212; had risen, literally from the ghetto, to success in so many fields. How they dealt with every ridiculous obstacle that was placed in their way. Can&#8217;t own land? Learn a trade. Trade guilds won&#8217;t let you in? Deal with money. No access to reliable customers? Provide consumer financial services for high-risk clients. WASP law firms won&#8217;t let you in or make you partner? Make your own and win crappy cases until the whole legal world knows you&#8217;re the best. Your country kicks you out because they say your science is different? Go and be Einstein somewhere else. Columbia University won&#8217;t allow you to attend because they have a &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_quota" target="_blank">Jewish quota</a>&#8221; (WTF?). Go to MIT and become Richard Feynman anyway (smooth move, Columbia).</p>
<p>I bet the same idiots who whine about affirmative action now (can of worms! can of worms!) would have whined about &#8220;Jews winning all the university places&#8221; back when the Ivy League was busy rejecting Richard Feynman and anyone else who looked too smart and had a German-sounding name. Mediocre members of a majority ethnic group loooooove flapping lip about how some minority is ruining it for them; it happens in the US with ethnic minorities; it happens in Kenya with Desis; it happens in Malaysia with ethnic Chinese (my Malay friends are going to beat me up over this). Funnily enough, though, the smart kids of all ethnicities never whine: <strong>when you&#8217;re the best, you&#8217;re the freaking best</strong>.</p>
<p>As Sutter explains,<strong> culture is everything</strong> (not genetics: Sutter says the evidence just isn&#8217;t there). The Jews built a religious culture founded on literacy and encouraging of learning: learning itself was considered worship. Sutter describes a traditional ceremony in which children were given honey as a reward in conjunction with some activity involving reading or memorizing parts of a certain religious text; the aim of the ceremony was literally to teach them that <strong>learning is sweet</strong> (reminds me of how I used to eat Jelly Bellies after each Chinese SRS rep); in terms of behaviorism, this is so many types of right it&#8217;s not even funny. So, when the Haskalah came and restrictions on secular activity were loosened, it was a matter of shifting the focus of that prodigious intellectual activity from the finer details of religious jurisprudence to whatever presented itself in the world outside. Not to mention the fact that the ever-present danger of being &#8220;asked to leave&#8221; led the Jews as a group to seek a portable, long-lasting, borderless asset &#8212; more valuable than land, cattle or bling and quite impossible to steal: knowledge.</p>
<p>Sutter and Kase both recount various interesting fables passed down in the Jewish community, illustrating the value of brain over brawn in even the direst of situations. There&#8217;s one about a Jew who is brought to a magistrate in some European country in medieval times, accused of murdering a gentile&#8217;s child. The magistrate is a raving anti-Semite, but is also a gentleman, and so likes to give the appearance of fairness; he announces to the Jewish guy: &#8220;Look here, Greenbaum; I&#8217;m a fair man. Since there were no eyewitnesses and DNA forensic evidence tests haven&#8217;t been invented yet, let that God of yours decide your fate. In this hat are two pieces of paper, one says &#8216;guilty&#8217; and the other &#8216;not guilty&#8217;. You pick. The paper shall be your fate&#8221;. Greenbaum knows that the magistrate reads too many shady conspiracy parchments, and is a thoroughgoing Jew-hater, and realizes that <em>both</em> pieces of paper say &#8220;guilty&#8221;; but there&#8217;s no way he could slander the town magistrate and live. Seemingly resigned to his fate, he mutters a prayer, reaches into the hat&#8230;pulls out a piece of paper&#8230;and eats it. Everyone goes into shock; his family is all screaming: &#8220;What are you Jewing?! Jew CRAYzay!&#8221;. And then he tells the magistrate: &#8220;the paper I didn&#8217;t pick is still there; you can check against it&#8221;. Greenbaum lives. Intellectual muscle saves the day. The end.</p>
<p>Another Jewish fable for children (this time from Kase) tells of a ship, again in dayes of olde. On it were two merchants and a scholar. The two merchants sell i-Parchments, designer clothes, bling and all manner of other luxury merchandise. They&#8217;ve been on the ship a few days, and the topic of conversation comes to the scholar and what he sells. The scholar tells the merchants he sells the most valuable merchandise in all the world, better than bling, designer clothes and i-Parchments. The other merchants are curious but puzzled. Bored, they ask around the ship, looking for the scholar&#8217;s merchandise. Eventually they realize that the scholar has no merchandise, and they&#8217;re like: &#8220;that Greenbaum kid is an egit&#8221;. Days later a storm hits, the ship sinks and almost everyone dies. The merchants and the scholar float ashore, stranded in a strange new land. With no insurance and all their merchandise gone, the merchants become beggars. The scholar goes into town and becomes a consultant for the king, makes a lot of gold and eventually uses his wealth to help his former fellow passengers back on their feet. Once again, the day is saved thanks to intellectual muscle.</p>
<p>Contrast this attitude to knowledge and its acquisition, with how many other cultures treat geeks and geekery. Think how most gaijin act towards Japanese-learning fellow gaijin. They call them names (&#8220;geeks&#8221;, &#8220;weebos&#8221;). They tell them to &#8220;stop pretending to read&#8221;. Tell them &#8220;they can do that at home&#8221;. They tell them to &#8220;stop acting Japanese&#8221;. Jock culture and sports heroes are lionized &#8212; and perhaps there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that necessarily, it&#8217;s just that too many people forget that most sportspeople are in fact interchangeable pawns (always one injury away from being thrown away like so many used Kleenex) in a wider game played and run by the aforementioned geeks. Everybody wanting to be a gladiator when it would be safer and easier and far more profitable to be a stable owner instead&#8230;</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, my mother listened to TONS of Barbara Streisand when I was a child. What does that have to do with anything? Nothing whatsoever. But she was always going on and on and on about the value of knowledge this and Barbara Streisand that and no one can take knowledge away from you and are you even listening and put down the Game Boy and this is my favorite Barbara song.</p>
<p>My Japanese journey (and, even the Chinese one) had its fair share of opposition, but the early microculture of my nuclear family, the fact that our home was reader-friendly &#8212; this set a good example. Growing up it all seemed quite normal. But as an adult, I have met a few people who treat me like a freak who &#8220;reads all the time&#8221;; interestingly enough, their social station somewhat reflects this attitude to &#8220;booklurnin!&#8221;. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m an intellecual juggernaut (I want to be :D)&#8230;and it&#8217;s not like economics is everything &#8212; knowledge is valuable in and of itself. But, let&#8217;s be coldly realistic for a second: most manual labor is as unremunerative as it is taxing; while it is very valuable <em>to</em> society, quite frankly it is not valued <em>by</em> society at all. At all. On the other hand, intellectual labor is almost the total opposite &#8212; thinking up ways to do less (&#8220;laziness&#8221;, of a sort) wins extra credit. At least it seems like that to me.</p>
<p>Currently, all intellectual life depends on literacy. Not, I think, because straight text is a superior medium (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books" target="_blank">quite the opposite</a>), but because it&#8217;s been around longer, boasts the highest quality and quantity of content, and has been chosen as the primary medium of intellectual discourse in the society we live in (of course, oral-centric intellectual cultures have existed &#8212; Celtic civilization and Ancient Greece are good examples). Today, <a href="http://afboy.pixnet.net/blog/post/6276778" target="_blank">a good-sized bookstore or library</a> (link to pictures of 誠品/Chengpin, a really nice bookstore in Taipei&#8230;I spent a whole night reading at their 24-hour branch <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8230;) simply has more and better information in it than the most premo premium cable. Thus, to cut yourself off from literacy is to cut yourself off from text is to cut yourself off from the bulk of intellectual activity and from the highest-quality information in the world. As a foreigner in a  bibliocentric country like Japan, this means you are restricted to one of three roles: (1) sheltered expat, (2) cultural ambassador, (3) exploited manual labor. There is no middle ground.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: <strong>don&#8217;t be a schlemiel; learn to read</strong> and keep reading &#8212; it&#8217;s fun and there&#8217;s a future in it. And get this book for the full story, because anything I say must be tainted and watered down quite a bit. Anyway, the massive worldwide Basque blogging conspiracy won&#8217;t let me make this post any longer, so&#8230;goodbye for now.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/kbl-khatzumotos-book-list-august-2008" target="_blank">the last edition of Khatzumoto&#8217;s Book List</a>. Maybe it&#8217;ll be a monthly list again, maybe seasonal, maybe just &#8220;whenever&#8221;. Funnily enough, I&#8217;d kind of felt guilty about recommending books to people; I felt like I&#8217;d become a &#8220;book pusher&#8221; of sorts. But, you know what, screw that; it&#8217;s not like people are being <em>forced</em> to by them. Plus, kids keep sending me email after email asking me to recommend them books, and I know I enjoy getting opinions on books before buying them, and my friends are tired of hearing me talking about the books I like, so&#8230;why not post about it.</p>
<p>Rather than recommend books in one large post, I&#8217;d like to try just focussing on one book at a time. There&#8217;s enough say about each book that this approach makes sense.</p>

<p>This is one of the least well-known and most underrated manga of all time, especially considering that it runs a solid twenty volumes. It&#8217;s somewhat like the Ben Stiller of manga &#8212; it&#8217;s good and it&#8217;s been good for a long time, it even gets distributed through mainstream channels, but somehow it&#8217;s never at the top of public consciousness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/uramiyaheta4.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/uramiyaheta4.jpg" alt="怨み屋下手" width="358" height="253" /></a>The artist&#8217;s drawings are amateurish in the bad sense of the word &#8212; LOOK AT THOSE LEGS!! WHAT THE LONG HAPPENED TO THOSE LEGS!? AND WHY DOES SHE HAVE <em>MAN HANDS</em>?! In a way, it&#8217;s kind of inspiring that one could suck so hard at drawing and still be a real mangaka/漫画家. However, his stories are <em>da bomb</em>: Kuri can write. I am, quite literally, addicted to this series. It&#8217;s weird because structurally, every story is quite simple: revenge is taken at the request of a client. So, you kind of know the general destination. However, the journey there is one heck of a ride. Spinning twist after twist after turn after twist, Kurihara <strong>never does what you expect him to</strong>; every story leaves you thinking &#8220;NO&#8230;WAY!&#8221;. The violence, the coldness and the plausibility of the stories are just&#8230;as Dave Chappelle might phrase it: &#8220;too real for you, Billy&#8221;.</p>
<p>This may sound a bit weird but I actually find this series <a href="http://quite...edu" class="autohyperlink">quite&#8230;edu</a>cational. There&#8217;s plenty of casual discussion of civil and criminal law, and even the structure of the police force. The book doesn&#8217;t set out to educate, it&#8217;s just that you&#8217;ll pick up a thing or two as you read on. Also, the violence is actually indirectly <em>critical of</em> violence; no one ever comes out and says it explicity, but the ultimate implication is that hate only breeds more hate and that we should all just be nice to each other. You may need quite a high level of Japanese to fully enjoy it all, but, like I&#8217;ve said before, focus more on your interests than your &#8220;level&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another strong point is the fact that while there is an overarching plot, each individual story more or less stands alone; where American TV and comics have traditionally tended to have a shortage of sequentiality, Japanese comics (I think) have slightly too much of it; once in a while, it&#8217;s nice to have a manga that you can jump into from anywhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000GH3PLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=B000GH3PLI" target="_blank"><img class="left" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/udramiyahonpo2.jpg" alt="怨み屋本舗テレビドラマ" width="279" height="155" /></a>Finally, there is also an equally engrossing live-action <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B000GH3PLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=B000GH3PLI" target="_blank">TV drama</a> adaptation composed of twelve 30-minute episodes plus two movie-length specials (AFAIK, the specials are not included in the main DVD box set: the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00120HXD4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=B00120HXD4" target="_blank">first special</a> is available here, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001P4WVB6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=B001P4WVB6" target="_blank">the second</a> won&#8217;t be out on DVD until Marchish but can be reserved). The TV show follows the manga quite faithfully &#8212; but of course with some necessary omission, as well as some very skilfull compression and mixing of separate stories from the manga into the feature-length specials.</p>
<p>One more thing &#8212; there is a spinoff/sequel manga series now in serialization: 怨み屋本舗 巣来間風介/ URAMIYA HONPO SUKURAMA FUUSUKE. I haven&#8217;t read it yet&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 8 of 10 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-it-takes-to-be-great/" class="series-142" title="What It Takes to Be Great">What It Takes to Be Great</a></div><p>I&#8217;m not sure how directly this relates to AJATT. I mean, it relates. But I&#8217;m not sure that it relates to everyone doing AJATT. In fact, I know it doesn&#8217;t. But, it is an issue that affects me and that affects some AJATT readers. In fact, now that I think about it, it affects everyone who ever has longish stretches of free time that just seem to slip through their fingers despite the best of intentions going in. So, yeah, it&#8217;s relevant.</p>
<p><strong>The Big Question</strong></p>
<p>OK, enough introductizing…the question at hand is this:<strong> &#8220;Why Do People Who Have All the Time in the World Get Nothing Done?&#8221;</strong> Why is it that you had a whole week to do catch up on your classwork over Thanksgiving Break, but not only did you not finish it, you didn&#8217;t even start it?! You didn&#8217;t even crack open the book! WHY? All you did was sit on your butt, eat dead, rotting bird and watch every episode of <em>Robot Chicken</em> released to date. And when you ran out of that, you reached for <em>Gilmore Girls</em>. Wow, this post is going to sound sooooo dated in 15 years.</p>
<p>Do we need management? Do we need bosses? Do we need stress or at least eustress to get anything done? Do we need the threat of pain and suffering to get our butts in gear? Do we need something to fear? Is an idle mind Dick Cheney&#8217;s workshop? I say yes and no.</p>
<p>If we had been left alone as kids, this would not be an issue. Young kids who have not yet undergone that much processing, and <a href="http://www.unschooling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unschooled</a> kids seem to do fine getting stuff done.</p>
<p>OK, but forget about kids. Stupid kids thinking they&#8217;re our future. <strong>I&#8217;m</strong> the future, you vertically challenged motherlovers! Let&#8217;s bring it back to us. So, why do people who have all the time in the world never get anything done? Why&#8230;do people who have all the time in the world never get anything done? WHY do people who have all the time in the world get absolutely nothing done? Chris Rock&#8217;s stand-up style is affecting my writing.</p>
<p><strong>Lottery Winner/Windfall Syndrome<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t freaking know why. But I have a wacky Khatzumoto hypothesis about it. I call it <strong>lottery winner syndrome</strong> hype o&#8217;thesis.</p>
<p>We all know those stories of lottery winners who, like, were totally poor, and then they won the lottery and overnight became decamillionaires, but then overnight became po&#8217; again. The New Age PD people will spin you a tale about the &#8220;Law of Attraction&#8221; and how they weren&#8217;t a &#8220;vibrational match&#8221; for the money.</p>
<p>Mmmmyeah. This is what is known in linguistics as &#8220;bollocks&#8221;. It&#8217;s a special kind of bollocks, though, because it&#8217;s actually correct at many levels, but it&#8217;s bollocks because it&#8217;s the same as saying &#8220;the Sky Deity is urinating&#8221; instead of &#8220;it&#8217;s raining&#8221;, or &#8220;Remote Desktop hates me&#8221; instead of &#8220;I forgot to open port 3389&#8221;, or…yeah…or that.</p>
<p>What I mean is, we can accurately describe and predict the same phenomena (effect of attitude and knowledge on life experience) without going all southern California about it and trying to sell people a seminar. Did I mention I hate personal development seminars? Yeah, but that&#8217;s just my two cents. PD books are cool, though.</p>
<p>Dang, dude, far too many asides. Where were we? Oh yeah &#8212; lottery winner syndrome. Yeah, it totally happens, man. Totally. In fact, it happens so often I want to give it a new, more general name: the &#8220;<strong>windfall syndrome hypothesis</strong>&#8220;, whereby:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">People who have been in a state of impoverishment with respect to a given resource, are very likely to completely misuse and exhaust the resource if and when they abruptly come to have it in plentiful supply.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Corollary: People who gradually acquire more of the resource tend not to do so.</span></p>
<p>I and two Japanese friends of mine who live nearby have left the so-called &#8220;normal&#8221; company life that most adults currently live. We work from home. We set our own hours. We are basically free to do whatever we want whenever we want. In the common parlance, &#8220;we have a lot of free time on our hands&#8221;. We are timewealthy. We timerich, be-arch.</p>
<p>But, for a while there, we weren&#8217;t nearly as productive as we want to be. In fact, we had become less productive when free than when we were company serfs (and everything but company work was a side project that had to be done on the commuter train). Dude, there are only three podcasts up right now. I haven&#8217;t produced a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dick-and-jane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dick and Jane</a> comic since my Sony days. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/khatzumemo-like-supermemomnemosyne-but-web-based" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KhatzuMemo</a> went a year almost untouched. Fortunately, that&#8217;s changing now, due to reasons and discoveries I&#8217;ma going to a-discuss-a a-here.</p>
<p>OK, so the windfall hypothesis so far is saying what happens and when it happens but not why. Like so many things, it does come down to psychology, to philosophy, to state of mind, baby (I&#8217;m doing the touching-my-temples-with-both-index-fingers thing, and I&#8217;m saying &#8220;mind&#8221; in a near-whisper). State of miiiind, maaan.</p>
<p><strong>Innumeracy</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/479421622X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=479421622X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/innmueracy3.jpg" alt="Innumeracy, Japanese Version" width="115" height="144" /></a><br />
Why? Because of a subtle subspecies of a disease called innumeracy (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/479421622X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=479421622X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a great book, by the way</a>). Innumeracy can affect even people who otherwise like numbers and math of the matics. Innumeracy is the reason people will drive across town to Kroger to save 50 cents on roasted peanuts, but will not blink at a $50,000 difference in house price because their being semi-conned into focussing on the low/no-down-payment and the monthly cost of the mortgage (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4479792414?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4479792414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another great book</a>). As if the $50,000 somehow matters less because it&#8217;s being siphoned off over time (plus interest, son!).</p>
<p>The innumeracy at work in the windfall syndrome can actually be expressed verbally &#8212; without numbers &#8212; it is already in the title of this post:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Do People Who Have All the Time in the World Get Nothing Done?&#8221;</p>
<p>Can you see it? I&#8217;ll point it out for you: &#8220;<strong>all the time in the world</strong>&#8220;. This is the innmueracy of large numbers &#8212; innumeracy of infinites. Governments use it all the time, wangling a billion dollars here and there. Regular, schooled-and-therefore-innumerate taxpaying folk are so bamboozled that they swallow all these budget tricks.</p>
<p>So, in short the problem is: we (tend to) have a very <strong>poor understanding of the concept of infinity</strong>: we fallaciously conflate it with any sufficiently large-seeming number. Just like those rags-to-riches-to-rags lottery winners who think that the money is infinite &#8212; it could never run out &#8212; only to discover that, yes, one hundred million dollars can, in fact, be exhausted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the fault of the lottery winners. The people around them play a role, too. Get considerably richer than your friends and watch their behavior change. You don&#8217;t even have to wait for it to be six figures…just start making about twice as much money as your friends and watch them act differently; watch them act as if your money is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Like Cuba Gooding, Jr. once said on <em>Oprah</em>, when you become a millionaire, and an old friend/acquaintance asks you for $10,000 and you say no, and they say that you suck and wealth has changed you…it&#8217;s not you that has changed; it&#8217;s them: they never would have asked you for that kind of cash before, but suddenly they act as if you&#8217;re a never-ending fountain of no-strings-attached grant money. In fact, they more or less believe you are. (Similar things happen where people who have less steal from people who have more, thinking &#8220;it&#8217;s so little; they won&#8217;t notice&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>Timewealth and Timepoverty</strong></p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s bring it back to time. People  who have a lot of free time certainly have a lot more than most. Many salarymen (サラリーマン) in Japan have, on a good weekday, maybe two hours of discretionary time &#8212; if that. In contrast, someone not living the reeman (リーマン/salaryman) lifestyle &#8212; even a housewife &#8212; arguably has 24 hours a day free, right? Which means they have, say, 12 times as much time as a reeman (リーマン). Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. As with money, there is &#8220;time tax&#8221; in a sense. First of all, we all need to sleep maybe, I dunno, 6 to 10 hours a day to stay healthy and sane. Some people more, some less. So, strike off 8 hours for sleep. That leaves 16 hours. SIXTEEN FREE HOURS! That&#8217;s still 8 times more than our fictional reeman (リーマン), right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Personal maintenance &#8212; eating, showering, getting ready, let&#8217;s give it two hours. Which leaves 14 hours, right?</p>
<p>Wrong. Let&#8217;s say exercise and travel combined take 2 hours, leaving 12 hours. And then let&#8217;s just say &#8220;various&#8221; other tasks involving care and maintenance of things other than one&#8217;s person &#8212; housework, childcare, petcare, and play-breaks (since (1) virtually no one can work on something without breaks indefinitely, (2) many people have these kinds of maintenance responsibilities). That leaves 8 hours for some real work.</p>
<p>Eight hours is still a good amount of time. But you know what? It certainly isn&#8217;t infinite. My figures are all kind of fudged and estimated and made-up; it&#8217;s probably hard to be truly general since except maybe Japanese housewives, people are going to have very unique life patterns. Maybe with some timehacks people can squeeze out an extra two hours, bringing us back to 10.</p>
<p>So, this person with &#8220;all the time in the world&#8221; is really only 4 to 5 times timericher than a reeman (リーマン). In the US, where I&#8217;d hazard a guess that regular-a$$ employees have 4 hours a day of truly discretionary time, this means that the timerich are only maybe twice as rich as &#8220;regular&#8221; folk.</p>
<p>Unlike money, time can&#8217;t be created; it can only be &#8220;reallocated&#8221;. And there&#8217;s a hard limit &#8212; the day is only 24 hours long for any of us. Add in all that natural overhead (&#8220;tax&#8221;), and a timerich person just isn&#8217;t that rich.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is that not only do many of the timerich think they&#8217;re far richer than they actually are, so do the timepoor cling-ons. You know, those people who ask you to do something because &#8220;come on, maaan, it&#8217;s not like you don&#8217;t have the time&#8221;. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you respond to every email that ever comes into your inbox, be-arch? Come on, man &#8212; YOU HAVE THE TIME&#8221;. &#8220;Back up my files for me! Come on, maaan! You have a terabyte!&#8221;. &#8220;Buy me a house, Bill Gates &#8212; come on, man &#8212; YOU HAVE THE MONEY&#8221; (actually, he doesn&#8217;t: a lot of that net worth is stock and there are rules preventing him from selling it…plus, if he were to sell it, it could be taken reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally badly).</p>
<p>So, the timerich are not only bombarded by infinite requests for their &#8220;infinite&#8221; time, they also put infinite demands upon themselves. (And, like I said, a timerich person is anyone who has considerably more discretionary time than the so-called norm; many people experience sudden temporary timewealth in forms like Thanksgiving Break and summer holidays, even public holidays). Not because they are stupid but because they are in fact following a code of ethics. By this simple, invisible code, it would be wrong for an infinitely wealthy person to be stingy. It would be wrong for a person who has infinite time to not do infinitely good work: one&#8217;s fundamental sense of morality would not allow it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4774127280?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4774127280"><img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/gtd.jpg" alt="GTD, Japanese Version" width="143" height="203" /></a>According to David Allen of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4774127280?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4774127280" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Things Done</a>, this is why people who already have too much to do often keep taking on more stuff &#8212; without some kind of management system to tell them otherwise, they may feel busy and burnt-out, but they have no way of telling for certain that they have far too much going on and they need to start saying no outright &#8212; so they keep taking on more projects, often until they fall apart from the strain of it all (i.e. go physically/mentally bankrupt, like unto a lottery winner). Those projects can be as simple as taking on too many books to read. Only when you have something like a single, (visibly jam-packed) &#8220;to read&#8221; box do you realize that, in fact, you have too much to read and this pamphlet&#8217;s just gonna have to go suck it. Without a visible spillage, they may just think that their glass is heavy but that they should keep pouring in more water.</p>
<p>I, my friends, and everyone who&#8217;s ever put off coursework for the weekend or Thanksgiving Break &#8220;when I&#8217;ll have a whole week to catch up&#8221; (as if all 168 hours could be spent lump sum, <em>en masse</em>, nonstop on the work you hadn&#8217;t been doing all semester), all thought we had infinite time. So we tried to do infinite work. And we didn&#8217;t just end up only doing &#8220;a leetle bit of work&#8221; &#8212; we did virtually no work. No manga produced, no website put up, no KhatzuMemo updates. Because we were paralyzed. We&#8217;d spend days and weeks just THINKING CRAP UP, because we (subconsciously) felt we had to because, after all, we had the time. And, yeah, if you had an infinitely long life, then 70 years spent just playing with ideas for your Great American Novel would be no problem. But you know what? Not only do you not have an infinite life, you have pretty durn short days.</p>
<p>So, yeah…this is why short, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winnable games</a> work…they bring us back into finite reality. This is why giving a kid a dollar and teaching her not to spend all of it will help her if she ever suddenly has a kajillion of them. In short &#8220;a lot&#8221; of anything, really isn&#8217;t that much.</p>
<p><strong>The 80-20 Principle</strong></p>
<p>Remember when I hinted at &#8220;discoveries I&#8217;ma going to a-discuss-a a-here.&#8221;? My big &#8220;discovery&#8221; was the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4484981068?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4484981068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80-20 Principle</a>. In fact, I&#8217;m reading a whole book about it. It is fascinating stuff, man. And liberating. These kind of ideas used to upset me, kind of like how certain people (hippies) always lament at the rich growing richer &#8212; it&#8217;s called feedback, motherlover; wouldn&#8217;t it suck if getting more of something made you lose it? The idea that the vast majority of effects stem from a minuscule minority of causes can seem unjust…but think about it &#8212; the next time you make a to-do list at your computer, know that for every 10 items about 2 will actually be really worth it. Rather than stress out about all 10, focus on those 2, and then, if there&#8217;s still time, try to fit in some of the other 8. It&#8217;s like that object lesson about trying to fit pebbles and rocks into a jar. If you put in the pebbles, there&#8217;ll be no room for the rocks. Put in the rocks, and let the pebbles fit around them.</p>
<p>I used to try to get everything done. I was the perfectionist. And it was killing me; I was getting symptoms of all those middle-class neuroses (what &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Pretty+White+Kids+with+Problems">pretty white kids with problems</a>&#8221; collectively refer to as &#8220;issues&#8221;) &#8212; panic attacks, OCD-like behavior, watching <em>Gilmore Girls</em>. OK, it never quite got that bad, but you see what I mean.</p>
<p>Many days, I would avoid doing anything, just so I could evade the self-imposed duty to be perfect, complete and infinite. But thanks to all these books, I have a whole box of tools to help me work with that. <em>Eat That Frog</em> and <em>Getting Things Done</em> taught me how to slice up my work so small that even complex, dirty duties (who likes filing their taxes?) could be as emotionally neutral as the proverbial flipping of burgers.</p>
<p>This was a major step forward, but by itself it was not enough. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-now-habit-language-acquisition-as-a-long-term-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Now Habit</a> taught me to let go of being perfect and just get on with it. And the <em>80-20 Principle</em> taught me to look for and zero in on the very least &#8212; the one or two widget-making/burger-flipping tasks &#8212; I could do to achieve the very most. I feel good. I knew that I would, now.</p>
<p><strong>Example from Real Life</strong>:</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a list of changes to make on AJATT. And I started making the changes, then I thought  up yet more ideas and I started working on them. In about two minutes I was literally working on ten things at once (those books, as good as they are, don&#8217;t won&#8217;t can&#8217;t change your behavior for you, rather, they lead you to observe it and show you what to do, then <em>you</em> change it). I was trying to be at all points in space and time at once, kind of like in <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> (<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.jp%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fd%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D%25E3%2582%25B9%25E3%2582%25BF%25E3%2583%25BC%25E3%2583%2588%25E3%2583%25AC%25E3%2583%2583%25E3%2582%25AF%25E3%2580%2580%25E3%2583%25B4%25E3%2582%25A9%25E3%2582%25A4%25E3%2582%25B8%25E3%2583%25A3%25E3%2583%25BC%25E3%2580%2580%25E3%2582%25B7%25E3%2583%25BC%25E3%2582%25BA%25E3%2583%25B3%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Ddvd&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy the Japanese version, motherlover!</a>) when Tom Paris went to warp 10; I was flying at warp 10 with no inertial dampers, shields down, broken deflector…I was going to get crushed by the enormity of my own thoughts.</p>
<p>Then I stopped. First, I wrote down what I wanted to do. Writing it down is something many of the PD peepz recommend &#8212; it helps you judge things in their true context, against everything else that needs to be done (when it&#8217;s just in your head, everything can seem important). As David Allen has hinted, the purpose of a list of tasks is not necessarily to do all of them, indeed a lot of it is a matter of choosing tasks to <strong>not do</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote down all the tasks. Then I numbered them in order of &#8220;easiest to do and greatest long-term benefit&#8221;; I like easy. I noticed one of the tasks wasn&#8217;t a task at all, but a nebulous, amorphous, undefined, unwinnable project: &#8220;update/streamline Table of Contents&#8221;. I deleted it and went with &#8220;add recent (= October/November) articles to Table of Contents&#8221;. Oh yeah &#8212; like the pebbles fitting in around the rocks, I also picked up some of the lower-numbered tasks &#8220;on the way&#8221;, quite unintentionally. Which, funnily enough, led to an overall update/streamlining of the Table of Contents.</p>
<p>Which all seems very petty, but…if you&#8217;d been there, you&#8217;d have felt the realness.</p>
<p>Like the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-is-an-srs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SRS</a> once taught me about memory, 90-95% right is good enough. The remaining 5-10% is almost never worth going for (pretend for a moment that the long tail doesn&#8217;t exist; I don&#8217;t know how to fit it in) &#8212; too much work, too much pain, too little gain.</p>
<p><strong>In Closing</strong></p>
<p>So do you need a boss? Only if you don&#8217;t know this stuff. That&#8217;s what bosses and editors and producers do for employees/writers/artists &#8212; they make these task-splitting, get-&#8216;er-done, 80-20 decisions. This work is valuable, but most of it wouldn&#8217;t be necessary if more people were (allowed and placed in a position to learn) to do this for themselves.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m actually right or not about any of this but…it seems to explain what I&#8217;m seeing. What&#8217;s your experience? Share!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the time this blook has been running, there has been plenty of what might be called &#8220;personal developmenty&#8221; or &#8220;motivationy&#8221; content. And there&#8217;s good reason for that. People are failing to learn languages for two basic reasons. For one thing, their methods suck. But even more fundamentally, their entire state of mind (confidence/lack thereof) and ability to manage themselves through a project of any considerable size and length is literally zero. That&#8217;s what you get when you put people through years of &#8220;sit down, shut up and do as you&#8217;re told&#8221;; you get people who only know how to be managed and be led &#8212; you get sheep.</p>
<p>When I was in college, I used to try to save money by borrowing books from the library, or reading about books online. Looking back, this was not an entirely flawed strategy. Plenty of books need not be bought; they can be picked for information once and never looked back at again. But some books are so important, so valuable and so ripe for re-reading that they do need to be bought. And owned. And held. And loved. And read (&lt;&#8211; do you like how this is an afterthought?) And highlighted the heck out of. This is one such book. It&#8217;s that good and it&#8217;s that important.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4309244351?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4309244351" target="_blank"><img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/guzu.png" alt="戦略的グズ克服術―ナウ・ハビット" width="176" height="237" /></a></p>
<p>A lot of books in the self-improvement/personal development field are full of crap or otherwise not worth your time. This is not that kind of book. This book owns. And if you read it, mark it, re-read it some weeks later, and while reading really start to apply the lessons it contains, I am sure you will find more success in both your language acquisition projects and in life generally.</p>
<p>The book is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425524?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1585425524">The Now Habit</a> / <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4309244351?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=7399&amp;creativeASIN=4309244351">戦略的グズ克服術―ナウ・ハビット</a> / <a href="http://www.books.com.tw/exep/prod/booksfile.php?item=0010417401" target="_blank">拖拖拉拉不是好朋友</a> by Neil Fiore . I&#8217;m going to sound super-mean here, but with notable exceptions (like AJATT readers!), far too many military people I have come across have been&#8230;intellectually slow jerks prone to violence. Please, do not threaten to send cruise missiles over to my house, you&#8217;re not smart enough; I&#8217;m just telling you my experience with military meatheads; I thought it was just an Army problem but even my beloved Air Force seems to be rushing to meet its quota of schmucks &#8212; ten solid years of brainwashing from <em>Stargate SG-1</em> cannot erase this fact. And then there&#8217;s that annoying fact that kind of gets left out of polite conversation&#8230;the fact of military organizations basically existing to perform and/or enable the (a) burning, (b) stabbing, or (c) torture of human beings, all &#8212; we are told &#8212; for the safety of certain abstract nouns. Plus there are cool badges. And fortunately the human beings getting a-b-ced are typically brown people so it&#8217;s all good pass the salt.</p>
<p>Badges, motherbadger&#8230;That just sounds like a female badger.</p>
<p>Why do I get caught up in flamewars that are never going to happen? Oh yeah &#8212; this Neil Fiore guy is ex-military. And why that matters is because you just don&#8217;t get books this perceptive, gentle and useful from actual human beings, let alone military personnel.</p>
<p>&#8230;I feel like something deeply dehumanizing was just said&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, think about it &#8212; AJATT is useful and perceptive, but it certainly isn&#8217;t gentle with all its misogyny and antisemitism and constant scatalogical references. Pooh. Most personal development books written by women are gentle, but useless in terms of application and too muddled to contain any real perception. Most PD books by men, meanwhile, just suck all around. So, this <em>Now</em> book is a little miracle: this book has the minerals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425524?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1585425524" target="_blank"><img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/nowhabit.png" alt="The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play" width="158" height="238" /> </a></p>
<p>How does it work? First, Fiore firmly locates the causes of procrastination. Yeah, the P-word: the AIDS, cancer and pins-and-needles of people trying to get things done. For most of us, the root cause comes down to unworkably high standards gradually inculcated during childhood, often by well-meaning parents who themselves suck at self-management. Anyone who&#8217;s experienced or observed many self-consciously &#8220;high-achieving&#8221; families knows what I&#8217;m talking about: the parents who, when their kid gets ten A&#8217;s and one A-minus, rather than congratulating the kid, instead ask: &#8220;Why did you get an A-? This is unacceptable. What the flock, kid?!&#8221;. This can turn the kid into a failure-phobic perfectionist.  The kid  then (unconsciously) uses procrastination as a defense mechanism &#8212; starting work late because then at least &#8220;lack of time&#8221; can excuse what would otherwise have to have been a perfect project by her internalized standards.</p>
<p>My family always wanted the best for me, I grew up comfortably and well-off&#8230;but&#8230;(*cue  violin*) my childhood was a lot like this; nothing was ever good enough; no matter how well I did, the question always remained: &#8220;But Khatzumoto, why didn&#8217;t you X?&#8221;. This is the part of the movie where Robin Williams tells me it wasn&#8217;t my fault and I cry <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Haha, it wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> bad; I&#8217;m just super glad to be able to realize it and change it now. The point is: <strong>(1) Standards that are too high make it impossible to get any work done outside of an emergency, so one of the major reasons otherwise smart people procrastinate is to force an emergency &#8212; and therefore a lowering of standards. </strong>(2) Fear of failure is not the same as desire for success; the latter will get you places, the former will get you&#8230;on medication.</p>
<p>But if Fiore stopped there he&#8217;d just be like every other psychologist &#8212; someone paid large sums of money to blame everything on our parents. Fiore goes beyond that and details his simple-looking treatment for the disease. He teaches you to make sensible standards, make fun the center of your life (getting rid of the lockdown/martyr syndrome through what he calls &#8220;unscheduling&#8221; &#8212; a schedule that focusses on requiring yourself to play), and ask yourself <strong>constructive questions (when can I start? where can I start? what can I do right now?)</strong>, all part of a full complement of techniques based on behavioral psychology i.e. Burrhus Frederic Skinner. That&#8217;s right, kids &#8212; the very same techniques that &#8220;The Man&#8221; uses to manipulate you, can be used for good, so you can manipulate yourself.</p>
<p>Fiore&#8217;s techniques are actually rooted in his experience getting a Ph.D in psychology after his time in the military; in this sense, they are actually better than most of the The Man&#8217;s tricks because not everything The Man does constitutes effective management, in fact a lot of people&#8217;s problems getting things done come from internalizing bad management tools (in a word, coercion). As a Ph.D student, Fiore noticed kids around him with no lives, apparently spending all their time on their dissertations, always stressed out, for years at a time, but not getting jack done. He basically resolved to use the psychology knowledge he was acquiring on himself (what a concept!) to get his Ph.D done in a really short time while actually having a life.</p>
<p><img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/guzukats2.png" alt="戦略的グズ克服術―ナウ・ハビット" width="277" height="220" /></p>
<p>Which is all well and good but I know that doesn&#8217;t get across how cool this book is. It&#8217;s a book that sounds dry in description but is superb in effect. When Fiore is explaining the situation, it&#8217;s as if he knows you personally; that&#8217;s how perfectly he has understood the problem at hand. This man knows what&#8217;s up and he knows how to deal with it. So, please, don&#8217;t just take my word for it. Really, don&#8217;t. My explanation of it sucks. You need to read the real thing in its full, original context. Primary source, baby. Read or listen to the book. And when you&#8217;re done, read it again. In fact, if you can, get the audio book rather than the straight text. Why? Because (1) You&#8217;re much more likely to repeat it, and (2)  It leaves your hands free so you can get implementing right as you listen &#8212; after all, the theory in this book is tight, but it&#8217;s meaningless unless you start applying it, and if you&#8217;re going to apply, the best time is right there and then. Right now. Go on. You&#8217;ll thank me later. This is easily one of the best works in its field, as well as the least-promoted.</p>
<p>I thought there was no Japanese version, but it turns out that a Janslation (Japanese translation) of this book finally came out only a few months ago (April 2008). I was so struck by its quality and relevance to the very thing at hand in AJATT &#8212; a long, self-directed project &#8212; that I felt it deserved a plug here and even a titillating photo of me. Think of it as an extension of the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/category/attitudestechniques" target="_blank">Mental Tools</a> category. Before finding out about the existence of the Janslation, I would listen to the English audiobook while reading something in Japanese, just to keep the old immersion up. Hey, I come correct.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s all from the manly desk of Khatzumoto.</p>
<p>Tell your Mum hi.</p>
[P.S. I hadn&#8217;t realized it while writing this, but <a href="http://www.cunning-linguist.co.uk/" target="_blank">Victoria the Cunning Linguist</a> actually mentioned this book <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-accomplish-great-things-small-victories-winnable-games" target="_blank">way back in the day</a>. Thanks, Victoria!].</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you just hate how so many magazines these days date themselves like three years in the future? I remember when I lived in the UK in the late 1990s, <em>PC World</em> magazine would put out its January 2015 issue in like 1997.</p>
<p>Exaggeration is humorous.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to buck the trend, darnit! This is information collected in the past, so it&#8217;s going to be back-dated and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to stop me except voice your opinion in comments.  OK, here we go.</p>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: The Tokugawa Era. Twenty years have passed since the shogunate opened diplomatic contacts with extraterrestrials and passed <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%83%E5%88%80%E4%BB%A4" target="_blank">the </a><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BB%83%E5%88%80%E4%BB%A4" target="_blank">edict</a> abolishing swords and, by extension, the samurai. But one samurai still holds out against the Roman invaders&#8230;Aaah, forget it! You just have to read it. Describing the set-up of <em>Gintama</em> in the hope of shedding light on its coolness is kind of like explaining <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> as &#8220;Italian plumbers jumping on mushrooms&#8221; or <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> as &#8220;space bounty hunters with jazz music&#8221;; it doesn&#8217;t quite do it justice. Anyway, both the manga and the anime <em>own</em>; it really is funny stuff. Loaded with characters you&#8217;ll wish existed for real, biting wit and parodic references to virtually every other manga, anime, drama or variety show ever produced in Japan, plenty of which you&#8217;ll know (<em>Trick</em>, <em>Shonen Jump</em> itself, and cetera!). Great jokes, great writing, great way to learn Japanese&#8230;<em>Gintama</em> will have you in stitches. While you&#8217;re at it, get the anime as well, for listening practice. Well, actually, just for plain enjoyment, but, you know &#8212; two organic clay pigeons, one free-range stone. <em>&#8216;Tama</em> is still in serialization (25+ volumes and counting), but unlike <em>Dragon </em>&#8220;We Own Your&#8221;<em> Ball Z</em> or <em>One &#8220;</em>Is the Number of Lifetimes You&#8217;ll Spend Buying This&#8221; <em>Piece </em>&#8220;&#8230;Of&#8221;, they&#8217;re actually worth getting.</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: I hate the news. Haaaate the news. Vapid, inaccurate, biased sensationalism prepared by people who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about but are acting as if they do. I stopped watching the news and reading newspapers a long time ago. But I still want to know what&#8217;s going on in the world. As soon as I saw this handsome paperback tome (it&#8217;s nearly 1000 pages long) at the train station, I knew I had to have it. Filled with essays (papers?) written by experts in their respective fields, often having wildly differing opinions on the same issue (minus simplistic <em>Crossfire</em>-style posturing for the sake of posturing). People who actually know what they&#8217;re talking about, debate, discuss and dissect in commercial-, spin- and (relatively speaking) brainwashing-free black and white text. No one pretending to be impartial, no one pretending to simply be giving an account of the facts; it&#8217;s got all the issues that are in daily newspapers &#8212; increasing pet ownership, relations with BRICs, the aging population &#8212; without the fluff and facade. This collection also boasts a number of papers by people who wrote <em>the book</em> on subject X, be it immigration or &#8220;parasite singles&#8221;.</li>
<li>Sidenote: The author bios and references to other works are perfect for follow-up. From the perspective of a learner, I&#8217;d say you&#8217;d do just as well getting a previous year&#8217;s issue if the price is right.</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: Another favorite of mine. Think of it as a monthly version of 日本の論点 (which is an annual collection). As you might expect from a more frequently published work, it&#8217;s slightly more prone to knee-jerky, alarmist, fadish discussion than 論点, but overall, still a worthy read. You might consider getting this one from your library if you can. Failing that, from a learner&#8217;s perspective, it may be worth buying a couple of issues if only because it&#8217;s much more portable than the 800+ pager that is 論点.</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: One of my favorite PD books; I&#8217;ve read and re-read this one many times, and it&#8217;s been on heavy rotation in my manbag for weeks at a time. Kanno firmly locates the source of a good portion of time poverty in simple untidiness. And seeks to kindly, gently and humorously (you&#8217;ll love her style, and the way she suddenly breaks into new parapgraphs to emphasize something &#8212; a tool I copied, by the way) lead you to a saner, tidier lifestyle, without the OCD/type A/guilt-based/Victorian appeals to morality (&#8220;cleanliness is next to godliness, you ****ing wogs!&#8221;) that are typically associated with getting things in order. She makes you <em>want</em> to be neat, and makes you <em>want </em>to read her book and makes it feel good; no one&#8217;s scolding you. One of the most powerful and deceptively-simple-in-a-&#8220;didn&#8217;t everyone learn this as children?&#8221;-way pieces of advice she gives is this: &#8220;出したら、仕舞う&#8221; &#8212; if you take it out, put it back. It sounds almost stupid when you think about it&#8230;but how many adults do you know that have yet to master this?

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: Wow. Writing these is tiring. Yeah, so, this is a straight up 絵本（えほん）&#8211; a (children&#8217;s) picture book. Um&#8230;yeah. It looks like it&#8217;s not actually a mere translation, but, in fact, a bilingual joint collabo venture between Iwamura and Carle. Sweet. I read this book back in the day; the repetition was really cool and firmly planted some really useful structures (&#8220;grammar&#8221;) in my mind. It&#8217;s so simple, in fact, that I never found it necessary to look at the English; everything is clear from context. The lack of kanji kind of sucks hard for RTKers like you and me &#8212; and it&#8217;s what kept me and 絵本 from seriously dating, but oh well&#8230;You know, to tell you the truth, I <em>really</em> want to write something like this, except with kanji. <em>Dick and Jane</em> was an attempt at that, but&#8230;I feel like it got too complicated. Oh yeah, this was supposed to be about someone else&#8217;s book. Anyway, it&#8217;s a good book. Buy or borrow it.</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: Mmm&#8230;due to the nature of the subject matter and information sources involved, you can never be sure that this kind of thing is entirely true. Early in the book, they attempt to insinuate that Kim Jong-Il/金正日 killed his little brother when they were like 6 years old&#8230;And they keep drawing Kim Il-Sung/金正成 with like this massive, hideous goitre action going on. Hmmm&#8230;mmmmm&#8230;I mean, at least <em>try</em> to fake some grounding in reality, son! This is the sort of thing that is later revealed to have been reverse propaganda &#8212; kind of like the borderline-fraudulent exaggeration of Soviet military capability by let&#8217;s just say people who hang out in five-sided buildings. Either way, it&#8217;s an enjoyable read, and potentially a fascinating history lesson. Sounds like a lot of drama went down on that Korean peninsula. Yeeah! Asia! トヨタ！寿司！</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: You already know that <em>Samurai Champloo</em> is one of the best anime ever. Now, enjoy the manga! There were only two volumes produced, but they have much of the anachronistic humor and sweeping, breathless action of the original. チェケラチョー (check it out, y&#8217;all!)</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: <em>Crayon Shinchan</em> is a living legend. Naughty humor for the peoples. And it&#8217;s especially good for kanjiphiles &#8212; imagine an irreverent, full-kanji, furiganaed children&#8217;s book &#8212; since we tend to skew ourselves toward reading abstract material if only because (1) that&#8217;s what much of the adult world is about and (2) kanji gives us that power. But words like うんこ and おしっこ are just as much a part of Japanese as 大胸筋矯正サポーター. So, <em>Crayon Shinchan</em> is like <em>Shrek</em>, in that it&#8217;s ostensibly &#8220;for children&#8221;, but the humor is really operating at two levels; it&#8217;s the kind of thing parents purport to purchase for their progeny but actually end up reading on their own. The regular <em>Crayon</em> is great to begin with, and this owns even more: it&#8217;s a special edition (one of several? are there more? I don&#8217;t know?)  in which our titular hero keeps his toddler age and personality, but is taken out of his usual family context and put into spoof fantasy worlds loosely based on cultural icons like <em>Lupin the Third</em>, <em>Charlie&#8217;s Angels</em> and Jackie Chan movies. In one episode, &#8220;drunken fist kung fu&#8221; turns into &#8220;somniferous fist kung fu&#8221;, whereby &#8220;Shin Chan&#8221; becomes more powerful the sleepier he gets&#8230;yeah, there are tons of puns, and you&#8217;ll enjoy them all. And another thing! The humor is all basically self-contained, such that knowledge of the regular <em>Crayon Shinchan</em> is not a prerequisite. You&#8217;ll be laughing out loud in public, causing yourself both joy and embarrassment.</li>

<li>Khatzumoto&#8217;s Komments: Yeah, this book needs no introduction, really. It&#8217;s one of the &#8220;classics&#8221; of the PD genre. Unlike classics in other fields, though, people actually read this one&#8230;of their own free will. Translator Tanaka had a bad habit of splitting this thing up into multiple volumes (print and grow rich?), and adding, I kid you not, MORE FOOTNOTES THAN ACTUAL BOOK&#8230;a single tome becomes a freaking trilogy but I&#8217;m not bitter. Friggin&#8217;&#8230;Anyway, so I&#8217;m mostly putting this thing up <strong>because it combines everything in one nice paperback as Nature intended</strong>! And I had a hardish time finding it. So here. I give. To you. Thank me later.</li>

Also, Hill didn&#8217;t actually write it; it&#8217;s more of a Cliff&#8217;s Notes prepared by the Asia Pacific HQ of the Hill Foundation.

<p>OK, that&#8217;s it! Feel free to share your own recommendations, or requests for the kinds of books you(d like evaluated for next time. I figure a lot of people are wanting 敬語 and programming books, and I haven&#8217;t put those up here yet, so that might be the focus of the next edition of KBL (hey! sounds like &#8220;kibble&#8221;!).  OK, see you next time!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello [I am Lothar of the Hill People]! And welcome to the 0th edition of what many people are calling &#8220;The Oprah&#8217;s Book Club of the Internet, but without the charm, influence or relevance, and mostly in Japanese anyway&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>A lot of people have asked me for book recommendations. And I struggle with this. On the one hand, I hate being told what to do, and I don&#8217;t want to tell people what to do &#8212; the whole of AJATT can be summed up in one phrase: &#8220;if it&#8217;s in Japanese, then it&#8217;s good&#8221;; that&#8217;s the only &#8220;condition&#8221; or &#8220;rule&#8221; if you will. Also, my books reflect my tastes, I mean, this is the difference between a typical class environment and doing stuff alone &#8212; you don&#8217;t have to read that lowest-common-denominator crap about &#8220;hey, what&#8217;s your major?&#8221;, and &#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m Tanaka Tarou from the ABC company&#8221;.</p>
<p>Speaking of interests, I hardly read <em>any</em> novels. Generally speaking, novels and me are not friends. I skip to the last page and try to get myself an executive summary before my next board meeting, nome same? Hehe&#8230;mmmm.</p>
<p>Having said all that, there are a ton of Japanese books out there, and when you&#8217;re just starting out, it can be a challenge to tell what books are worth getting. Especially if you&#8217;re buying exclusively online, and don&#8217;t have a chance to, skim, scan and sample the books in question.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve come up with a compromise: <strong>every month I&#8217;m going to just リストアップ (list up) the books I&#8217;m currently reading, or books I have previously read and really liked, and think you might enjoy</strong>. And give you a line or two about why I liked them. Sometimes I might even put up books I hated, but that were interesting.</p>
<p>By the way, I was inspired to do this by the <a href="http://www.yamaneko.org/mgzn/eng/index.htm">Yamaneko Honyaku Club</a>, which, while now apparently inactive, gave me some <a href="http://www.yamaneko.org/einfo/mgzn/jcb_e0103.htm#manga">super useful book recommendations</a> when I was walking up the Japanese hillock of literacy. Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>Levels</strong></p>
<p>I hate levels. For one thing, they&#8217;re all just made up anyway. And who the phork&#8217;s business is it what you read? If you&#8217;re 7 years old and you want to read <em>War and Peace</em> , then read <em>War and Peace</em> (note to all 7-year-olds: this book is about as entertaining as a 1000-page album of other people&#8217;s baby pictures in dim light; you&#8217;re not falling asleep because you&#8217;re stupid, it&#8217;s just that this book is indeed boring; remember, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-and-what-to-read">if you&#8217;re not sad that the book is ending (<em>I&#8217;m running out of pages!</em>), then it&#8217;s not a fun book for you</a>). You, too, can enjoy any Japanese reading material at basically any time in your Japanese process.</p>
<p>Besides, that, no matter how &#8220;simple&#8221; a book in terms of level, if it&#8217;s boring, then game over. And no matter how supposedly &#8220;complex&#8221; a book, if you&#8217;re enjoying it, then you = teh winn0r. Remember, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-manga-to-read-as-a-beginner">always give priority to your interests over your level</a>. Something you&#8217;re interested in means you&#8217;re going to have domain knowledge. A science manga may be hard to read&#8230;unless you&#8217;re a scientist. As Nick Hornby hinted, it really isn&#8217;t that intellectually taxing for a physicist [someone who has extensive domain knowledge in physics] to read a physics book.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I mean, it is, I guess, a fact that one goes through phases in one&#8217;s language development. So&#8230;so&#8230;(do you like how I write this as it comes?) here are some&#8230;some&#8230;(you like it?) arbitrary levels I pulled out of my&#8230;my&#8230;mind, with some reference to my current Cantonese experience. The numbers are nothing but a rough guide, and they may be completely wrong, and truth be told, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m actually going to use them or not in the end, but here they are just for kicks anyway.</p>

<li>Daoist Butterfly &#8212; you&#8217;re no longer sure whether you&#8217;re a Japanese person who dreamed she was gaijin, or a gaijin who dreamed she was Japanese. This is native-level fluency. 本でも書け、ゴルァ！</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, so I&#8217;ve been collecting links for another big post of website recommmendations,  but that&#8217;s just gonna have to wait. I mean, it&#8217;s just <em>gonna-have-to-wait</em>. Because I have found the goods that you need so badly. At least, the goods I needed when I was in the early stages of acquiring Japanese. Here they are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jp.playstation.com/support/manual/manual_list.html">Instruction manuals for the PlayStation series</a>.</p>
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and you&#8217;ll find the manuals for the original PlayStation. These come <em>with full furigana</em>. The same goes for PocketStation and PS one. And of course they have sweet diagrams and stuff, too. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Edit: While we&#8217;re at it, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/support/">here are the Wii manuals</a>. These come with furigana and <em>in color</em>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So&#8230;A lot of people come up to me and ask &#8220;Hey, Khatzumoto-sensei [yeah, they call me that, you know&#8230;], what manga are good for beginners? What manga should I read to get me started?&#8221;</p>
<p>And you know what? I tell them <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%E3%81%A9%E3%82%89%E3%81%88%E3%82%82%E3%82%93&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211">Doraemon</a></em> because that just seems like the right answer, the 正解. I mean, it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re <em>supposed</em> to say to people; it&#8217;s famous, a &#8220;classic&#8221; even, and therefore, you know, l33t.</p>
<p>But, dude, <em>Doraemon</em> is boring. Bawring (bee tee dub, this spelling only holds water if you have the same accent as me&#8230;HA!). OK, &#8220;boring&#8221; is a little harsh. It&#8217;s just&#8230;not interesting to read? More effective for insomnia than sleeping pills? I read a bit once and it was cool in the sense that it was Japanese and I was reading it, but not in and of itself. I dunno. Maybe I am being harsh. Like, I enjoyed how it had everyday action verbs, that was nice and educational, but it didn&#8217;t make me want to part with my precious fiat currency for the privilege of casting my eyes on it.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I didn&#8217;t come here to make libelous comments about <em>Doraemon</em>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">which sucks by the way, along with <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%E3%81%95%E3%81%96%E3%81%88%E3%81%95%E3%82%93&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;index=books&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211">Sazae-san</a></em>; Japanese people know this but they&#8217;re just pretending to like it because if you don&#8217;t, your Japaneseness gets called into question</span>. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Kind of like how I used to pretend to like <em>all</em> classical music and <em>War and Peace</em>, because that&#8217;s what &#8220;smart people&#8221; seemed to like. But I digress</span>. I came here to tell you something that I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/how-and-what-to-read">already essentially said before</a>, but which other people seemed to think was worth saying again. Other than the obvious, early-stage super-beginner material (stuff like <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAll-About-Particles-Kodanshas-Childrens%2Fdp%2F4770027818%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1208266143%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=alljapanallth-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">All About Particles</a></em>); there is no other stuff you &#8220;should&#8221; read. To quote my neighbor and gaijin-in-arms, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/tkyosam">Tkyosam</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Don&#8217;t read according to your level, read according to your interest.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I can hear the rebuttal: &#8220;but Khatzumoto, what if I&#8217;m interested in it but it&#8217;s too hard?&#8221; Well, if it feels that hard, then it&#8217;s not that interesting. By definition, then, even a &#8220;hard&#8221; book, if it matches your interest, will not seem hard at all. For example, I&#8217;ve read lots of science and engineering-type books in English, so Japanese books of that kind are easy and fun for me. I remember one time my Japanese-Korean friend (I&#8217;ve mentioned her before in comments, but, she was (is?) the cruelest corrector ever &#8211; I don&#8217;t think I have ever been slammed down more times in public by anyone else; and I am grateful for every time she did it &#8211; every time she talked super-fast and told me that if I didn&#8217;t understand then I&#8217;d better get on that; every time she said I sucked) said: &#8220;wow, a Japanese physics textbook? You must be smart.&#8221; But I told her &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re going to be presenting a new physics or anything. And the format is the same &#8211; explanation here, diagram there, a bit of equation action to make it all kosher &#8211; <em>i&#8217;s so simpo</em>! There&#8217;s no intelligence at work here, just habit.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, don&#8217;t worry about what your &#8220;level&#8221; is. Just worry about what you&#8217;re interested in and get into that. Anime or TV show you&#8217;ve seen before and liked? Get the manga. Like tennis? Get a tennis manga. Like cooking? Get a cooking manga. Like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B2%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88SG-1&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;index=dvd&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211"><em>Stargate SG-1</em></a>? Get&#8230;OK, there&#8217;s no manga for that one. And this goes beyond manga. What this article, indeed this site is about is this: <strong>whatever it is that moved you to want to learn the language in the first place, DO IT! (Or something as close to it as possible). That&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll learn</strong>&#8230;And we&#8217;re done. I think.</p>
<p>Oh, one other thing: I wasn&#8217;t sure whether or not this post was worth putting up. I feel right now that this site has reached a level of completion in terms of what (I think) you need to know is all up here and all that&#8217;s left is to go and do. Then again&#8230;that may just be a lack of imagination on my part? Unlike <em>Dragon </em>&#8220;291 Endless Episodes&#8221; <em>Ball </em><em>Z</em>, or <em>One</em> &#8220;46 volumes and counting&#8221; <em>Piece</em>, it&#8217;s not like it directly costs people money if this blog gets a little long, but at the same time, it seems like conciseness is a good thing. Either way, let me know what you&#8217;d like to read about, and also whether or not this post was useful to you. Tank ye kindly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s keep this one short.</p>
<p>Every so often in the history of humankind, a book comes along that will forever change us. Or not, I don&#8217;t know. But really, every few weeks or so, I find a book that is just so perfect that it&#8217;s as if it was written just for me to read it (you: &#8220;yeah, no kidding&#8221;). It seems like the author sat down and thought: &#8220;and it shall come to pass that one named Khatzumoto shall walk through the doors of a bookstore, and when he doth gaze upon this tome it shall be fitting for him to purchase it. So it shall be written, so it shall be done&#8221;. Anyway, this book I found <em>owns</em>, and not only that but it also has a sequel. The book is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/476318170X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211&amp;creativeASIN=476318170X"><br />
<img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/eigobenkyosuruna1.png" alt="Book 1 Cover" width="173" height="250" /><br />
英語は絶対、勉強するな！：学校行かない・お金掛けない・だけどペラペラ<br />
Absolutely DO NOT Study English: Get fluent without spending tons of money or going to English school<br />
</a></p>
<p>and its sequel:<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.jp%2F%25E8%258B%25B1%25E8%25AA%259E%25E3%2581%25AF%25E7%25B5%25B6%25E5%25AF%25BE%25E3%2580%2581%25E5%258B%2589%25E5%25BC%25B7%25E3%2581%2599%25E3%2582%258B%25E3%2581%25AA-2-%25E3%2582%25B5%25E3%2583%25B3%25E3%2583%259E%25E3%2583%25BC%25E3%2582%25AF%25E6%2596%2587%25E5%25BA%25AB-G-74%2Fdp%2F4763181718%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1197365259%26sr%3D8-7&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=247&amp;creative=1211"><br />
<img class="right" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/images/eigobenkyosuruna2.png" alt="Book 2 Cover" width="188" height="276" /><br />
英語は絶対、勉強するな！２：不安が消える・疑問が打っ飛ぶ・マジでペラペラ<br />
Absolutely DO NOT Study English 2: Clear your doubts and worries and get seriously fluent.<br />
</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s significant that this book should be coming out of Korea (the Southern flavor), whose scores as a nation on, I believe it is the TOEIC test (some random, stupid English test) are at the very bottom of the world: only Japan&#8217;s are worse. In today&#8217;s Korea, English schools are raking in tons of cash; parents are freaking out about their kids &#8220;needing&#8221; to know English; the government is in constant panic mode about how and where and when to get more English taught in public schools; businessmen &#8220;need&#8221; to know English; university professors of English have terrible English; people who can speak well are mistaken for being intelligent. In other words, Korea and Japan are in the exact same position. Now that I think about it, the Japanese/Chinese situation outside of the kanjisphere is the same: most people outside of East Asia are convinced that they cannot be literate in Chinese and Japanese, let alone speak them; their typical rationalizations fall into one of the following extremes: it&#8217;s either the &#8220;we&#8217;re not as smart as East Asians&#8221; camp, or the &#8220;East Asians are stupid and our writing system is better because the Greeks molested boys and used an alphabet too and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with liking boys&#8221; camp.</p>
<p>Along comes 鄭讚容 (CHON Chan Yon) to the rescue. Kicking butt and taking names, he very frankly lays out that the English situation in Korea right now is abysmal but that it need not be so. He then proceeds to give his own recommendations based on a method he developed for himself. In terms of philosophy (you CAN do it) and overall method (focus on understanding real English and imitating native speakers, not the crap that passes for English you find in textbooks) it&#8217;s very similar to AntiMoon which &#8212; along with that scene in <em>The Thirteenth Warrior</em> &#8212; is the source of many of the ideas you find on this site. Chon&#8217;s book and AntiMoon were written with English in mind, but they clearly have advice that essentially applies to all languages.</p>
<p>Anyway, the best thing is to go and read both books. Here&#8217;s a gem that struck me, from page 225 of the second book:</p>
<blockquote><p>「第一ステップでは、とりあえず英語を「無意味な音声」と考え・・・」<br />
[On learning to understand normal, fast spoken English] When you start out, just accept it as sound without meaning&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Chon wants us to get used to the sounds of the language. As you listen, you&#8217;ll naturally start to make sense of it. Like a fog clearing, the sounds will start to get clearer and clearer; you&#8217;ll pick out more and more. Chon calls these &#8220;little miracles&#8221;. He also suggests you imitate these sounds, just as sounds, regardless of whether you understand them or not; get your mouth making the sounds of the language.</p>
<p>These words on page 27 of book 1 amused and inspired Momoko:</p>
<blockquote><p>「親が赤ちゃんに『さあ、これから言葉を学びましょ』と言って、単語や文法を教え、これが主語、それは動詞で、あれは副詞なんて言うのを見た事が有る？」・・・どんな親も『可愛い子ねえ、お中すいたでしょ。おマンマ食べようね』『あらあら、おしっこしたのね、お締めがびしょ濡れよ』などと、赤ちゃんが理解しようがしまいが、とにかく愛情と一緒にたくさんの言葉を色々と浴びせ掛けるよね。そうやって親の言葉を始め、テレビの音、家の外から聞こえて来る声など、色々な音や言葉が赤ちゃんの小さな耳に休み無く吸収されて行く訳だ。」<br />
Do you ever see parents take their baby and go: &#8220;right, Timmy, settle down and sit tight, it&#8217;s time for you to learn LANGUAGE!&#8221;, and break it up into vocabulary and grammar and explain how this is a subject, this here&#8217;s a verb and that there is an adverb &#8212; I mean you just don&#8217;t see that&#8230;All parents go &#8220;You&#8217;re such a cutey! You&#8217;re hungry, aren&#8217;t you? Time for foody-woody, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;, &#8220;Ooo! You went pee-pee; your diaper&#8217;s aaaall soaking wet!&#8221; &#8212; whether the baby understands or not, they shower her with love and words. Day in day out the baby&#8217;s little ears are constantly absorbing this endless stream of words and sounds &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the words of his parents or the voices of people outside or whatever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another place where Chon really lays it out for me is here on page 28, again of book 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>「無条件に何でもたくさん聞けばいい」<br />
Unconditionally, constantly listen [to your target language].</p></blockquote>
<p>Chon further advocates the use of English-English dictionaries. What else&#8230;oh &#8212; he has a cool name for his method: &#8220;英絶方式&#8221;, the Absolute English Method, or as I like to call it: &#8220;All English All The Time&#8221; 8) .</p>
<p>Anyway, so&#8230;yeah, they&#8217;re good books, the Japanese is of course A-OK; translated by someone I presume to be Japanese-Korean. Chon is, like me, not an expert linguist, just a guy who learned how to do something and is sharing it with the world. He takes flac from people with established ideas, but he speaks the truth: don&#8217;t kill the language and &#8220;study&#8221; it &#8212; instead, live it, become it. Highly recommended.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Crossing the OS Rubicon</strong></p>
<p>The OS is dead! Long live the OS! I&#8217;m writing this from my freshly installed copy of Windows XP Traditional Chinese Edition. Let jubilation run freely (does that even make sense?). First impressions&#8230;sometimes, I feel like running with my tail between my legs back to my Japanese OS. I&#8217;ve been in a Japanese-only PC environment since February 2005, so about two and a half years. In that time, I&#8217;ve gotten really used to it, to the point that using an English OS is always a bit of context switch [&#8220;編集・・・コピー&#8230;Paste&#8230;<strong>what the English??</strong> Oh, wait, I know English, too&#8230;&#8221;]. I&#8217;ve even gotten to the stage where I can kind of skim Japanese (not yet as quickly as English, but getting there). But now, in Chinese, going back to having to read error messages and program notifications word-by-painstaking-word-to-make-sure-I-get-what-the-heck-is-going-on-<br />
oh-wait-I-don&#8217;t-quite-get-this-let-me-go-back-to-the-beginning-and-read-more-slowly-<br />
so-how-do-I-get-the network-up-again? <em>got me a little frustrated</em>. But I&#8217;m fine; I&#8217;m calm now.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/huanying.jpg" alt="Chinese Windows welcome screen" width="200" height="150" class="right"/></p>
<p><strong>How To Read Books That Are Too Hard For You</strong></p>
<p>So, up until now, I&#8217;ve always had a Japanese book with me in my manbag/over-the-shoulder European carry-all. The problem was that this isn&#8217;t very good Chinese practice. So, I started carrying a Chinese book. But the ones I wanted to read, while I understood them almost fully because they contain material I&#8217;ve previously been exposed to in other languages (they&#8217;re almost all books from movies and/or translations of other books), contained too many readings that I didn&#8217;t know &#8212;  I know what the character means, but not the reading. This was discouraging, because I felt that I wasn&#8217;t growing: I had tried writing them down in a notebook for later reference, but that failed miserably because I hate going back through old notebooks; I tried looking them up one a time as I hit them, but this is really slow going when you&#8217;re on a train, and often required me to have 3 arms). For a while there, I even stopped carrying Chinese books around, since there seemed no point taking them; they were &#8220;too hard&#8221;. Anyway, by accident, I found a solution for myself.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/keroro.jpg" alt="Reading books with stickers" width="300" height="400" class="right"/></p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple: when I hit a character whose reading I don&#8217;t know, I stick one of these tiny sticky labels on it. Then, when I get home, I can go through and collect sentences containing those characters. The cool thing is, I don&#8217;t have to feel guilty about not instantly looking up a word when I&#8217;m on the road: I know I&#8217;ll get to it eventually because I&#8217;ve marked it up. Also, it&#8217;s much better than pen in that it&#8217;s cleaner, it&#8217;s quicker, and you don&#8217;t have to deface your book (so it&#8217;s OK to do on library books &#8212; assuming you get <em>removable</em> stickers that come off without taking a healthy chunk of book with them). Plus there&#8217;s that great sense of achievement from removing the stickie: it&#8217;s like taking off a training wheel or something. The sticky labels are about the size of 1-2 characters &#8212; just right to cover a word &#8212; and perhaps best of all, you get to see the word in the exact context where you first found it. Finally, it also makes me realize that I actually do know a lot of readings, relatively speaking: in the book I&#8217;m reading right now, I usually miss about 1-2 per paragraph, so in that sense it&#8217;s encouraging, it gives something of visual-numeric perspective of my current state of knowledge &#8212; when I stumble upon an unknown word or reading, I often feel dumb for not knowing it [and busting out a dictionary each time I stumble made it seem like reading takes forever; it made things painful], but seeing that on any given page there are only so many of these sticky labels, it makes me realize that things aren&#8217;t so bad at all &#8212; in fact, things are pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>Skiving</strong></p>
<p>Funny story &#8212; I slack off Chinese to watch Japanese shows sometimes. Japanese has gone from noble endeavour to guilty pleasure. When no-one&#8217;s looking, I watch <em>Trick</em>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I was feeling stuck lately—worrying about how inadequate I am at speaking in everyday conversations, not sure how to say something in different ways or different degrees of politeness, and frustrated that the materials I have (e.g. manga, magazines, even bilingual Japanese/English books) seem a bit too advanced for my level right now.  How to bridge that gap between beginner and intermediate!?  </p>
<p>Then I stumbled upon something that’s perfect for me in the most unlikely of places. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4384030002?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=alljapanallth-22&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=247&#038;creative=1211&#038;creativeASIN=4384030002">中国語に夢中 (&#8220;Engrossed in Chinese&#8221;)</a> is a beginner book for Japanese learners of Chinese made up of simple dialogues and accompanying cartoons.  It ended up in our home because Khatzumoto is learning Chinese right now (laddering up from Japanese).  I, on the other hand, am using it in the opposite way that its authors intended: as a way to learn Japanese!  My Chinese is intermediate level, so I can use the Chinese part to check my understanding of the Japanese.  It’s a fun alternative to English translations.<br />

Oddly, I find it to be an ideal tool for learning Japanese conversation.  First of all, since it’s a book for beginners of Chinese, the Japanese translations reflect the simplicity of the Chinese dialogues.  In addition, because of some accident in format, there are two Japanese translations of the same Chinese dialogue—one that’s more colloquial (in the cartoon version) and one that’s more polite (in the text-only version).  I guess cartoons (where the visual humor has more of an impact) lend themselves more to slang while pure text tends to be more formal.  </p>
<p>This coincidence is fabulous for me!  For each piece of dialogue, I have two examples of how to say the same thing.  Score!  Because of the comic format, I also get a more gradual introduction to humor in Japanese.  I mean, sometimes the humor is a bit flat (as textbook material can often be) or I still don’t get it, but it’s definitely good training for recognizing and judging comedy in another language.  In addition, there are short articles on aspects of Chinese culture at the end of each dialogue.  The writing here is more formal and uses longer sentences and more advanced vocabulary than the dialogue, so it could help me prepare to read Japanese books after I finish the dialogue.  And when I’ve mastered Japanese (*sigh* hopefully that day isn’t too far away) I can go back and use this book to beef up my Chinese.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right.  Japanese materials for learning other languages can be just as valuable for learning Japanese itself.  The programs on NHK (Japan’s public television station) to help viewers learn English, French, and Chinese are a perfect example of this.  Often the presenters spend more time discussing (in Japanese) the grammar points or the meaning of sentences than they do speaking the target language!  If you live in Japan, you can browse the language magazine section of your local bookstore and find magazines devoted to various languages (English is the most common).  Inside you’ll find dialogues, celebrity interviews, newspaper articles, stories, and even recipes of varying levels of difficulty that are often accompanied by Japanese translations.  NHK also publishes excellent, short (and cheap!) <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/search?ie=UTF8&#038;keywords=NHK%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B8%E3%82%AA%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%AA%9E%E8%AC%9B%E5%BA%A7&#038;tag=alljapanallth-22&#038;index=books-jp&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=247&#038;creative=1211">serialized books</a> (a new one for each month) for learning other languages.</p>
<p>I don’t expect that this particular book will be of value to anyone else—it reflects my own current needs and my interest in China.  But I hope the principle at least can carry over.  Acquiring one language doesn’t mean you have to ignore other interests, areas of knowledge or countries that seem to be unrelated.  Finally, on a more general level, never be afraid to try something new and unorthodox when other things aren’t working.  As long as it has Japanese in it and it appeals to you, you’re going to learn something.</p>
