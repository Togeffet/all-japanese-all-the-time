					<description><![CDATA[The real irony of foreign language taxonomy I&#039;ve found is that they want it both ways: languages like Chinese and Arabic are so alien you&#039;d have a better chance of understanding a species from Zeta Reticuli II, but &lt;em&gt;so similar to English&lt;/em&gt; that you can grok them just by reading lists of English -&#062; Chinese words and translations. It makes so little sense that you have to wonder why no one said &quot;Hey, wait...&quot; sooner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely, I&#039;ve been saying for a long time now that you cannot possibly understand a people and their culture, no matter how long you live in the country (looking at you, English-speaking expats who have been in Thailand or wherever for 20 years and still don&#039;t speak the local language fluently), if you don&#039;t speak the local language.

Also, on another note, have you read Tokyo Vice? Although it seems that &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; people are xenophilic or neutral on foreigners, there definitely does seem to be some xenophobia within the culture, especially if you actually want to live there and integrate yourself into the society as opposed to just visit.

Cheers,

					<description><![CDATA[I studied quite a bit about Japanese culture and society as part of my university major, and after becoming fluent in the language and living among the people, I realize what a load of BS all those English-language textbooks about Japan are. There are definitely two entirely different Japans that exist: the one translated for us English-speakers, and the one I&#039;m living in now. (Not to say that the Japanese don&#039;t have equally off-base misconceptions about Americans, though!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I watch the news in Japanese, especially about worldwide things -like the whaling-, I get a different picture of what&#039;s going on. In anime/manga they don&#039;t draw a lot of clutter (obviously because that takes money!) but if you watch enough movies and dramas, you&#039;ll notice that that lack of clutter is more rare lol. Take モテキ, the lead guy&#039;s apartment is completely stuffed head to toe, wall to wall.

Also another big thing I&#039;ve noticed is when I talk to my Japanese friends. They&#039;re not the stereotypes that bloggers painted, also they tell me that I&#039;m not what they imagined I would be as an American. (apparently out in the world we&#039;re all a bunch of fat selfish pride-filled haters!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen your stuff before and admit I&#039;ve watched the in English.

An idea I had which I can&#039;t do anything with right now but that may be interesting to you is this.

Create a show/video thats entirelly in Japanese, keep it to 10minutes or less. 
Then take all the audio and then break that up into SRS&#039;able sentence packs, so that you end up with maybe 200 sentences, and then you send that out to your email list, tweet the download link etc. The subscribers/fans then download that, input it into their SRS and bang away at that for a week so that at the end of that week you upload the video, entirelly in Japanese and that person having studied your sentences would be able to understand a full Japanese Vlog. Maybe hardcode timed Japanese subtitles into the Video as well, but no Furigana.

Then on the release of that video, it will come with links to the next set of audio/text SRS files for the next video, and so on.

Just an idea :)]]></description>
