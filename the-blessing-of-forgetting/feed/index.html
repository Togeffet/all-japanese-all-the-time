					<description><![CDATA[On the same line, I find forgetting to be a useful tool when speaking in a foreign language. It&#039;s tough and weird, but I try to forget my native language as much as possible so that I&#039;m forced to think within the bounds of the words and concepts that I know in the foreign language. For example, I don&#039;t know the words for &quot;revolutionize&quot; or &quot;cancel&quot; in the foreign language well enough to use them actively, but because I have &quot;forgotten&quot; the English terms for these concepts, I&#039;m not tempted to try and say them in the foreign language (and sit there with a pained look on my face in the middle of the conversation).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does remind a little of as Alan Watts put it: ‚ÄúA scholar tries to learn something everyday; a student of Buddhism tries to unlearn something daily.‚Äù I see very little difference in the plasticity involved in be it coming to walk again after a stroke, or coming to understand the world in a different language. Either way, you have to empty your cup before being able to fill it up with something new. :)]]></description>
