					<description><![CDATA[I like these guys, personally I think one of the coolest artists in Japan is Ê§éÂêçÊûóÊ™é/Sheena Ringo. Her sound ranges from calmer and jazzy to hyperactive pop and rock and she doesn&#039;t have one of those stereotypical jpop girl voices. I also like School Food Punishment who&#039;s music entrances me. Lastly, I have a lot of bands/artists I love that err on the side of slightly overrated, but I&#039;m happy to overrate them too such as UVERworld, YUI, Arashi (it&#039;s good to like Arashi because they&#039;re in so many dramas!) and my biggest obsession, all girl 4 peice pop-rock group Scandal (the secondary singer has a squeaky jpop voice but the lead has a powerful deep rock voice balancing things out)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing! :D I&#039;ll look this band up. I have been into Jpop and Jrock for a long time. BoA has some Japanese, Korean AND Chinese songs. Also, Utada Hikaru has some good japanese songs too. (She speaks clearly and is easily to hear.) Asian Kung Fu Generation is awesome too. I love their stuff! ^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RIP SLYME made me love Hip-Hop! Japanes Hip hop has a flavor of its own, it&#039;s not as heavy as American Hip-Hop with all the rich-black-guy-with-all-the-bling-and-the-hot-chicks kind of style, but more of songs about daily lives, love and just having fun. I first encountered them with &quot;Nettaiya&quot; that they performed live at Music Station (TV Asahi) and I really was wowed by the performance. I downloaded all their albums and it never fails to keep me loving them. Their music goes on forever!

Masterpiece is indeed my very favorite album,  a perfect arrangement of songs that you just feel incomplete if you won&#039;t go through all of the tracks! :)]]></description>
