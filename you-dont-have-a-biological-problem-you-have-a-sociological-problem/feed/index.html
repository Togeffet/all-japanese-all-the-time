					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Even once you have the remote, you’re likely to cluster around a bunch of nearby (adjacent) channels — you’re far more likely to go up and down than to jump out 100 channels; not because you like the nearby channels better, but because they’re the easiest to get to.&quot;
Heh, so very true. Why do the first two or three pages of channels on Sky happen to be the most popular? Because most people don&#039;t care to look at the others. Most people would rather watch repeats over and over on the same channel before browsing the rest of the channels.

As for SRS reps, I eventually made this real easy for myself by not doing reps. I simply kept the tab open all day and would switch to it every few seconds, every minute or whenever I felt like it throughout the day. It was always there. If I was watching a movie and there was a silent scene with nothing happening, I&#039;d have a quick browse through the SRS. If it was an unimportant scene there to simply stimulate the senses, I would do reps until it finished. If I was watching a talk show and they switched to a subject I am not interested in, SRS. If someone starts singing, SRS. When it goes to adverts, SRS. Or I may use these intervals to read a sentence or two from an article.
In short, I don&#039;t dedicate specific time for any one specific thing, I don&#039;t set out to do something, it is just always there. There&#039;s always something to read, something to see, something to hear.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is so true.

After a long day at work, I like to slouch at my desk and immerse in audio/video. But I had real trouble doing my reps because that involved **shock, horror** sitting upright to use my touchpad and pen. Sometimes I&#039;d neglect the decks for days.

Now, I&#039;ve plugged in a mouse with the laser taped over, so it can just sit static over the &quot;show answer&quot; and &quot;good&quot; buttons in Anki. Click with the left hand, trace the answer on my thigh with the right, lazy as hell. 

It&#039;s kind of pathetic, but it&#039;s also kind of cool because now I can comfortably do more reps, and add more cards in the morning in the confidence that I&#039;ll have the energy to review them in the evening. So faster progress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think one of my favourite things you had said was a tweet from a long time ago, which this article partially echoes: &quot;If you’re lazy like me, don’t set a goal to do the right thing (e.g. brush teeth), just set a goal to be in the right place (brush in mouth)&quot;]]></description>
