					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I wonder why the sentences which I&#039;m bad at (and thus get a low score) show up immediately again. Wouldn&#039;t it be better to add them again to the end of the current days stack? So maybe the last item of the day would be asked again and again, but not all of the items i fail once. It&#039;s pretty easy to remember them when they show up immediately again.

Btw. what&#039;s about the mobile version... hard to figure out a solution?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thank god for Khatzumoto! 

wow thank you soo much!! 
I&#039;ve been using your SRS (khatzumemo) for like a week now and I&#039;ve been thinking it wasn&#039;t working, but all the sudden, I see myself pressing 4&#039;s and 5&#039;s over and over again now! 

I never even knew I could remember this well!
so thank you khatzumoto! you developed the SRS I&#039;m using and you&#039;re the one who first introduced me to the idea of an SRS so I have to thank you for that, and I couldn&#039;t think of a better place to put this so.. thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately I haven&#039;t been able to find such an option.  (I also did a quick Google search, and haven&#039;t found anything useful.)

Just for kicks, I had the phone navigate directly to question.php after I tried to login.  I got the same thing -- a blank page.  The odd thing is the blank pages I&#039;m seeing don&#039;t look entirely empty -- there is a scroll bar to the right, but the phone won&#039;t let me scroll around at all.  (It just beeps when I try to move down.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, Thanks for your suggestions.  It does seem that I wasn&#039;t spending long enough looking at the answer -- if I pause 10 seconds or so, it seems to move on to the next question.  I think the problem is that the amount of time it takes to read and &#039;get&#039; a rep is highly dependent on the card contents.  The one I was never getting off of was an old, simple question that immediately made sense to me.  (I had imported some old questions from another SRS.)

I&#039;ve tried enabling &#039;remember me&#039;, but it doesn&#039;t seem to change the phone&#039;s behavior.  It looks like it gets stuck on login.php, and never moves off of it.  I wonder if the phone refuses to allow automatic forwarding to the next page?

Sadly it looks like Gyao is restricted to those with Japanese IP addresses.  Whenever I go to register, it tells me it&#039;s limited to use in Japan.  (I even tried using a .co.jp email address, but that didn&#039;t seem to help.)

Thanks again for your help!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[yes that is what I mean, allow different categories. 

that way I could have my words and sentences separate.

					<description><![CDATA[@scout
#1) I made the scheduling stricter so that you have to really LOOK at the item and THINK about how you&#039;re going to remember it somewhat, and essentially earn yourself a 5-point score (maybe more than one)...that should only happen with new items or items with a bad track record. The reason for this is that when a lot of people &quot;forget&quot; something, usually it&#039;s because they never GOT it in the first place. I was wanting this to make you really think &quot;are ya sure you know this? really?&quot;...

If you find that too strict I might change it, or make it so that that item comes up later on that same day.

#2) I have seen that error...do you have cookies enabled on your cellphone web browser? Try that. Let me know if it still doesn&#039;t work...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, one more question for Khatzumoto. 

would it be possible to add a function to khatzumemo where, you can have multiple categories in the review section? 

like a section for Words and a section for Sentences(you could make whatever categories you needed though.) but I don&#039;t only SRS sentences I&#039;d also like to SRS words that I keep forgetting and need to remember, but would like them in their own category.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve come across two problems with KhatzuMemo and so far I&#039;ve been unable to resolve either one on my own.  Hopefully someone else will be able to clue me in as to what I&#039;m doing wrong.

1) I&#039;ve been trying to use KhatzuMemo from a computer with both Firefox 2 and IE 7.  I&#039;m currently unable to get past the first question.  After I look at the answer and rate how easy it was, the second rep shows the exact same question.  Worse yet, the number of reps for the day goes up by one each time I do this.  This seems to go one forever.  (Admittedly, I&#039;ve only actually tried it ~5 times in a row before giving up.)

2) It seems like my cell phone (a Verizon LG VX8300) doesn&#039;t want to play nicely with KhatzuMemo -- the login page works, but after logging in I get a blank page.  I originally wrote off using my cell phone since it lacks support for Japanese text, but now that it can be displayed as an image I&#039;m trying to figure out what&#039;s giving it issues.  Has anyone else seen something similar?

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, this might sound a bit odd, but is the Japanese &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; COMPLETELY dubbed in Japanese? Although over on Amazon they list the languages as 英語, 日本語 but I wonder if the songs are also dubbed in Japanese. The same goes for other musical-shows like My Fair Lady.

JDog, I think Christmas in Japan is primarily thought of as a lovers&#039; holiday and not one for the family. If it&#039;s spent at home, people just laze about at home. There is a trend towards spending Christmas with the family though, at least according to wiki.]]></description>
