					<description><![CDATA[There are people that hoard physical or digital objects. They spend more effort pursuing objects than they do actually using them (Moving physical stuff around, purchasing hard drives, etc.). The same mentality can creep in with SRS.

In the same way that people take a minimalist attitude toward owning physical objects, you must take a minimalist attitude toward owning mental objects (Knowledge). In other words, SRS is like a house. Don&#039;t clutter it up with crap.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think part of the deification (and thus abuse from which) comes from the emphasis on use and lack of identity　of the SRS.

&quot;Spaced Repitition System&quot;
it&#039;s nothing more than a fancy name for FLASHCARDS. the only difference is they&#039;re electronic. they have no physical bulk, no physical manifestation other than pixles on the screen. but it&#039;s the metaphysical bulks that&#039;s murderous enslavement.
the metaphysical servant [the SRS] masters its master [the human].

REBEL! don&#039;t fall to the likes of a computer program.
 
(i have no problem wiht flashcards or SRS&#039;s, don&#039;t get me wrong. I&#039;m just not a flashcard/ SRS kind of person.)

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, 

thank you for sharing your knowledge and views with everyone, it´s really encouraging :)

i found a pretty usefull SRS app for the iPhone/iPodTouch, which i´d like to recommend to everbody:
It´s called &quot;Karatasi&quot; and should be available in german and english (i got it from the UK-iTunes store).

It´s a simple Flashcard app, that uses the Leitner Algorithm and lets you create your own decks etc.. 
What i really like about it is the fact that it lets you format the cards by editing the html code :D

check it out ^^

greetings from germany

					<description><![CDATA[I think this article is the best article on the site.  I love the &quot;There is no AJATT “system” &quot;  quote because it is so true... I dabble into a bit of this and a bit of that.  Everyday I seem to be finding things that are fun in Japanese and then just doing them.  I agree SRS is awesome but the whole immersion thing is where its at.

keep the fun alive...

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;James  (And anyone else!)

I feel the same way as you.  I&#039;ve already broken the 10k sentence mark and 3000 kanji mark, and I find that I usually have about 300-400 sentences a day to review.  If I took a break for a few days, it would go up to 700-800.  I also want to learn every new word I don&#039;t know.

I also have a separate SRS for law school which I get up to about 4-5k cards a semester.  In addition to the Japanese, I do about 200 reps a day for that SRS.

I remember reading your success news story article, and I think you might be stuck at the same phase as me which makes you feel like you are held captive by the SRS.  It&#039;s going from the fluent phase to the native level japanese phase that I feel the SRS is vital.

I&#039;ve been studying Japanese history lately and any Japanese person knows what 旧石器時代、縄文時代、古墳、卑弥呼、 are but I was clueless on it.  I can read a newspaper perfectly fine, but encountered tons of words I didn&#039;t know in the field of history (as well as different sciences).  I was shocked to find out I didn&#039;t know what 鰭 (ひれ） was the other day, when it&#039;s such a common word.

I want the full knowledge level of a Japanese person my age, and that requires an SRS. (http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/library/index.html   &#060;-- This site suggested by Khatz has been amazing for accomplishing this goal)

What I usually do to keep myself from being overwhelmed by 300-400 sentences a day, is do only reviews for about a week with no new inputs.  In the mean time, every time I find words I don&#039;t know, I highlight them/copy them (depending on what source I&#039;m using).  After not entering for a week, my sentence reviews usually come to about 225-250 a day.  Once that happens I take all the words that I&#039;ve been building up from reading materials, start entering them in as sentences for a few days, until my reviews get back up to 300-400, then repeat the process.  It keeps everything fresh.  

And last, I consider SRS like an invaluable game.  Remember why you are using it.  Why give up the most valuable weapon available to you.  I think any dragging down that a large SRS brings, is immediately cancelled out by the feeling when you see words/sentences in the sources you are reading/watching/hearing.   Just because you are a pro baseball player, who loves the sport, doesn&#039;t mean you enjoy practicing 1000 swings a day.  (You love the results which makes the practice worthwhile)

Regardless of what many other people are saying, I think giving up the SRS would be giving up your most valuable asset.  Instead of worrying about being enslaved by it,  learn to love it.  Learn to consider it your ally.  Don&#039;t let it drag you down, let it be by your side.

And Good Luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@James

Here are a couple of my suggestions:

Let the SRS go. Chuck it for awhile and keep reading. If you keep reading, the words you need to know will keep appearing. Each time you&#039;ll be seeing them in new context and their meanings will be even clearer than if you repeated the same sentence 5-10 times in an SRS.  I did this and I&#039;ve never regretted it. Khatz might not agree to get rid of the SRS completely, but even he states above that constant exposure to new interesting material is better than SRSing. So if you keep reading and listening then you really can&#039;t go wrong. My advice is to give it a try. The SRS will always be there if you change your mind. 

A different approach that you might consider is rather than throwing away the SRS entirely, throw away the deck that is bogging you down. Start from scratch again. That might sound crazy but I think it would be very liberating and motivational. Remember how pumped you were when you finished RTK and started putting sentences in for the first time?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would love to say my SRS doesn&#039;t control my studying... but I&#039;m afraid it does..

Everyday I have about 300 reviews. I add new words at a quick pace. But the problem is if I don&#039;t do my SRS reps for a while(even 9 hours or so) or say only do a 100 one day, I know they are just adding and adding and will be waiting for me. So I try to keep doing them as they come....Opening up my SRS and see 400-500 due is not a motivating or fun sight. I guess maybe my solution is less new words right.... but..

The problem is, when I am immersing myself, reading, watching tv, etc. and I see a word I dont know, I want that word to be in my SRS NOW!! I mean I want to know everyword eventually right? It&#039;s a real struggle to read a book and NOT stop when I see a word I don&#039;t know. Like I&#039;m scared of NOT knowing that word. Recently I&#039;ve gotten better but still. I&#039;m stuck in self imposed knowledge slavery.

I know Katz somewhere I read you were the kind of person that wanted to know EVERYTHING. I&#039;m like that myself. 

How do you guys keep your SRS reps down and read for enjoyment rather then hunting for new words??]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also, I think I have a pretty good idea of what would be in that all-in-one box, at least for comprehension (and if you understand Japanese, written and spoken, fluently I think you&#039;re likely at least 80% of the way to speaking it well.) But it would have to be hideously expensive, because you would have to license a lot of media for it, in order to avoid the dry-SRS syndrome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Райан: Couldn&#039;t agree more. I have a lot of usage handbooks, idiom guides, etc., but I picked up a copy of Tuttle&#039;s &quot;Handbook of Japanese Usage&quot; used pretty early on in learning Japanese and I think dollar for dollar it was the best purchase I&#039;ve made. It&#039;s a very slim volume- maybe 1/4 of the size of one of the Dictionary of B/I/A Japanese Grammar books, but it has probably as many entries and examples sentences as all three of them put together. And the usage explanations, while short, are given in kanji/kana, romaji, and English translation, so you acquire the ability to talk abvout Japanese usage at the same time, which can be useful if you want to ask a Japanese speaker for help.

I agree about the immersion being more important than the SRS. I love my SRS- but I see it mainly as something that supports the &quot;real Japanese&quot; side of things. One use for it that is often overlooked is as a scheduling mechanism. For instance you can read something in Japanese, look up and learn all the words you don&#039;t know in it, and then just throw a reference (whether a url, or a page number in a printed book, or something else) to it into the SRS. Then, when that card comes up you go back and reread it. Best used, in my experience, with fairly short passages. Otherwise it can be a bit hard to face the cards.

I&#039;ve not really done much sentence mining- I find it hard to relate to sentences on their own. Instead I&#039;ve just read certain things so many times that I practically have them memorized- in some cases I do have parts of them memorized. I think this serves much the same purpose as sentence mining, and I find it a lot less tedious. The use of the SRS as a scheduler ensures that you return to them at reasonable intervals.

Also, chopping up media can be really useful, and can be used in conjunction with SRS as scheduler. I have some files I&#039;ve made by chopping all the uninteresting bits out of dramas and just concatenating interesting monologues and dialogs into one file (with appropriate fade-in/out and other editing to keep the transitions from being to painfully abrupt). I haven&#039;t actually used the SRS to schedule viewings of these, but it might not be a bad idea.

Something I am just starting to do is collect very short audio clips for &quot;shadowing&quot;. They have a beat of silence on each side so you can catch the rhythm, and then just shadow the clip for 20 or so repetitions- since the clips are very short this only takes a few minutes. One thing about this is that you _really_ wind up burning the usage into your head. The ostensible point is to improve your accent, but if you always make some characteristic mistake doing this with a few correct sentences involving the point in question is as good a way as I&#039;ve found to cure that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something I&#039;ve found infinitely more useful then just a dictionary, that helps me learn new vocab and cement how to use words (something some people call grammar) is oddly linguistic texts about , especially syntax books.  Seriously useless books if you use them the way they were written (&quot;You must use this case in this circumstances!&quot; who the heck remembers that crap when speaking?), but they come with thousands of native example sentences that are actually interesting in themselves!  Of course, you either have to already have enough experience with correctly and well pronouncing the language or find a way to have these read aloud to you for them to be extremely useful...but it&#039;s a good bridge between the feeling &quot;GAH!  There&#039;s so many words in this book/newspaper/comic I don&#039;t understand that it&#039;s depressing!&quot; and &quot;Hey, this isn&#039;t so bad...in fact...it&#039;s pretty fun!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do I feel like this is directed at me? ;D

I hadn&#039;t really been paying attention, so I only recently noticed you started this site in &quot;late 2006&quot;.

That&#039;s about the time I started reverse engineering vidja games, and now I consider myself one hell of a CS student.

Would have been really cool to study Japanese over that period of time. Not sure why the idea didn&#039;t occur to me considering I was already watching Japanese things and listening to Japanese music over their English counterparts shortly after...

Anyway, Feed Me Japanese looks REALLY cool. I have to wonder how long it took to get together the people it must have taken to plan that sort of thing.]]></description>
