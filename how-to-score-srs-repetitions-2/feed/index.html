					<description><![CDATA[IMO, what helps is if you don&#039;t see it as numbers, but you see them as grades. So in Anki:

					<description><![CDATA[It seems to be happening with IE (6 in my case), looks fine in Firefox.

In your code, at the end of each of those entries (0-5) is an extra 
span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline&quot; /
(I omitted the greater than/less than tags in case it tries parsing them)
Firefox treats them properly since that / should tell it to close the tag immediately... seems IE&#039;s not being so kind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey James

&gt;(though you still can pronounce and understand)
No matter how many sentences, if you can pronounce and understand, then you&#039;re good to go. 

&gt;Do you think this is too long a sentence to put into mnemosyne?
No, it isn&#039;t. It is on the lengthier side of things, but it&#039;s not out of the question. Some sentences in Japanese get long. What I do is:
1. Enter the full, long sentence in
2. Break the sentence up into logical parts (generally, clauses) and enter *those* parts, too
I find this works best. It&#039;s good to have some long sentences in there because Japanese sentences can get long. But, as far as your brain is concerned, learning and sentence-building happen in small, manageable chunks. So that&#039;s why I enter the parts into the SRS, as well as the whole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you re posted this. I felt that I&#039;ve been going to easy on myself and just grading 5 anything that I could get through eventually and understand the meaning.

Do you think it&#039;s better to do only 15 sentences a day and make sure you have them absolutely drilled rather than doing 30 not so drilled ones? (though you still can pronounce and understand)

I &#039;ve also been wondering about the length of the sentences. Some of my senteces are fairly long e.g. Èõ¢Â©ö„Åô„ÇãÊôÇÂÆ∂Â∫≠Ë£ÅÂà§ÊâÄ„Å´È§äËÇ≤Ê®©Ë®¥Ë®ü„ÇíËµ∑„Åì„ÅôÁî∑„ÅÆ‰∫∫„ÅåÊúÄËøëÂ¢ó„Åà„Å¶„Åç„Åü„Åù„ÅÜ„Å†. I understand this sentence but beacuse of it&#039;s length it is difficult to memorize in it&#039;s entirety. Do you think this is too long a sentence to put into mnemosyne?
