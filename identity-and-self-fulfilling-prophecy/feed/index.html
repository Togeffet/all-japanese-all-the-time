					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been living in Japan for 2 1/2 years.  I&#039;ve been dutifully studying using text books and cramming vocab but I&#039;ve never been very good.  I decided I needed a drastic change and 6 months ago I started AJATT. 

I have tonsillitis and was trying to find a good doctor to treat me/do the surgery to remove them.  Before I always relied on my fiancee, who is Japanese, to help me with this.  But she&#039;s away on business so I realized I&#039;d have to go to the doctor&#039;s myself.  Now that I&#039;ve done 6 months of AJATT, not only could I explain my situation perfectly and understand the doctor&#039;s responses, I could even read and fill out all the forms!  When did I learn to do that?? I couldn&#039;t do that 6 months ago.  It&#039;s amazing.  I can&#039;t wait to see where I&#039;ll be in another 6 months.  Now I&#039;m going to watch some more Hayao Miyazaki movies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[この話題と同じではありませんが。。。
I&#039;ve been reading up on AJATT for a bit here- not very long actually. I&#039;ve been studying Japanese for quite a while now, back in 2004, I was intrigued by small words but didn&#039;t know anything about kana or Japanese grammar, until I entered high school and was in a Japanese class in 2008-2010. Back in 2009, I found out I have to be home schooled, I&#039;ve been freaking out over how to continue learning Japanese until I found AJATT. This is great. You may not think you&#039;re a great person, but you&#039;re the coolest teacher ever- if you&#039;d consider yourself one. (Sorry if I don&#039;t seem to be making any sense- I&#039;m slightly incoherent while I am typing this.) 
I absolutely love typing to my classmates from Japanese class. (Although most of the responses are 「何を言いましたか？」 and 「わかりませんでした 」 or my favorite 「moon language の人 ww」.) I am so glad you suggested MyLanguageExchange.com, and I am glad that there&#039;s other people that I can relate to who love learning Japanese as much as a gamer would love the genre they specialize in, and are determined to become fluent- yet, I&#039;m shocked and surprised there&#039;s such simple methods to learn it that actually work. Khatzumotoさん, are possibly the best- (What would you call yourself here?)- I have ever seen yet. You act very natural and casual, while your methods actually work very well! To be honest, I&#039;ve been watching my anime subbed as I have always, but now I cover up the subtitles unless I really don&#039;t understand a particular phrase, I read my manga raw, and I listen to Jrock Horizon as much as possible. I&#039;ve been taking every fork in the road that lead to 日本語.
So, I tried out MyLanguageExchange, and it was really, really great. I&#039;m very confident about my writing and reading comprehension though I&#039;m still learning a lot of kanji. This really helped me with what areas I should start digging in. Again, thank you for suggesting that site! I have a lot of questions in mind, because I am not quite confident enough to start speaking because my listening skills aren&#039;t as good because my mind tends to stall at the wrong time even though I understood what was said- the first time it was said. Did you ever have this problem? 
It&#039;s becoming more natural to me to not respond when I don&#039;t get something and just remember to look it up later instead of looking silly by pausing the whole conversation just because I forgot what 「唯」 was. However, that is an extremely bad habit in my mind. How do you suggest I try and get over this- or more importantly, is that a sign that it&#039;s still too soon?
I&#039;ve been learning a lot in the past couple of years and I can tell now that online translators suck most of the time except for just asking for specific verbs or nouns. Is there any that have a really good rep for being accurate with grammar? Most of the ones I&#039;ve seen are powered by Google or and/or Bing and fall into that &quot;sucks&quot; category. 
Also, are electronic translators more or less reliable than ones on the internet? Or just about the same? Normally I use a grammar dictionary but they&#039;re way too head-spinning since they don&#039;t explain what&#039;s being said as well as an actual person would be able to, that&#039;s why I need help.
Finally, I haven&#039;t been speaking Japanese aloud every single hour of the day compared to before but my English is now sucking because I can&#039;t stop my accent from kicking in. I spent a good fifteen-twenty minutes on trying to pronounce &#039;lyrics&#039; and &#039;drill&#039; properly aloud. Help! Is that normal? (Same goes for a couple of times I caught myself speaking in English but I kept saying 「それとも」, or 「とにかく」.)
One of my goals is to see my teacher Shimogama先生 when she moves back in Nagasaki with her kid and spouse, and visit her for a day (a simple one with plenty of cash at hand and confidence, right?)- only speaking Japanese. My other goal is to work my butt off for dual-citizenship, move to Kōbe City, Hyōgo Prefecture. I have a whole life ahead of me, but that only means I want to work harder to achieve my goals faster to build more goals and see where I end up in on the other side of the rabbit hole. I know it won&#039;t be easy, but what is your opinion?

I spent a good fifteen-twenty minutes on trying to pronounce &#8216;lyrics&#8217; and &#8216;drill&#8217; properly aloud. Help! Is that normal? (Same goes for a couple of times I caught myself speaking in English but I kept saying 「それとも」, or 「とにかく」.)<br />
One of my goals is to see my teacher Shimogama先生 when she moves back in Nagasaki with her kid and spouse, and visit her for a day (a simple one with plenty of cash at hand and confidence, right?)- only speaking Japanese. My other goal is to work my butt off for dual-citizenship, move to Kōbe City, Hyōgo Prefecture. I have a whole life ahead of me, but that only means I want to work harder to achieve my goals faster to build more goals and see where I end up in on the other side of the rabbit hole. I know it won&#8217;t be easy, but what is your opinion?</p>

Are you kidding me? If you suck at motivating people, I would honestly be scared to meet someone who&#039;s good at it.  I can&#039;t even thank you enough for what you wrote there, it makes sense on so many levels...really. So simple when you hear &quot;it was there all along&quot; but sometimes it takes that external stimulus for you to &quot;wake up&quot; to the truth.  ありがとうございます！　＾＿＾]]></description>

Haha, trust me, I am the queen of laying in bed all day hitting the snooze bar (actually I don&#039;t even bother with the snooze, I just turn the darn thing off), but I will read that document thing when I&#039;m drinking my coffee or eating breakfast (which on weekends is about 2pm &#062;.&#060;)... usually only bits and pieces of it though, just enough to get me going, then I stop.]]></description>

There&#039;s nothing you really need to &quot;do&quot; as such... because you are already Japanese anyway. You don&#039;t need to be convinced or converted; you just need to realize this basic truth. 


Consider this: what are the chances that you, a Westerner, happened to take an interest in Japanese culture? The Japanese language is only 1 out of 7,000 languages on this planet. Japanese people make up 2% of the Earth&#039;s population. And many Westerners resent/have no interest in any culture other than their own. The fact that you took an interest in Japan, out of the blue, and then decided to pursue this interest on such a serious level, speaks VOLUMES. It means that, deep down, there was a part of you that already resonnated with Japanese-ness. 

You already felt connected to Japan... which is, of course, 当たり前. Why SHOULDN&#039;T a Japanese person (such as yourself) be interested in Japan? I would even go as far as to say that your being Japanese is much greater than your being American/British/whatev. You speak English by accident, but Japanese was a decision that you made.  And what we choose to become is always a million times more meaningful than we were born with.


Don&#039;t look for &quot;evidence&quot; that you&#039;re Japanese; you won&#039;t find it anyway. What we call evidence is really just a bunch of random things that that we talk about after the fact (ex post facto?) to stroke our own nationalistic egos. &quot;I&#039;m Japanese because I look Asian and speak Japanese and I eat food X....&quot; Bullsh!t. You&#039;re Japanese because you identify as such. You speak Japanese and eat noodles with chopsticks as a way of making the outer world believe that you sh!t is serious, lest your fragile ego be hurt. Inner identification is where it all starts.

If you&#039;re still unconvinced, I&#039;d recommend finding some good Japanese friends (even if it&#039;s just people on the internet). Spend ample time with these people - you&#039;ll realize very quickly that you have more in common with them than not. And the things that you don&#039;t have in common yet (such as mannerisms) are because you&#039;re still a Japanese baby. Babies don&#039;t know about manners or how to use chopsticks or how to fill out a 履歴書... but they learn, and so will you.

If you spend enough time with your J-friends to actually become close, you&#039;ll also start to feel like a member of the gang, and before long you&#039;ll have (subconciously) absorbed so many of their mannerisms that everyone will know that you&#039;re Japanese; it won&#039;t even be a 疑問点. New J-people that you meet after that will seem surprised that you can be so 日本人らしい while maintaining a Western appearence, but you&#039;ll know that it&#039;s a done deal. 

Then again, you know all along that you were Japanese, right? You know from the start this was your destiny, and that nothing and no one could stop you. You knew from the start that it couldn&#039;t possibly be any other way. Now all you need to do is go out and prove it to the rest of the world. So get out there and start claiming what is rightfully yours. 

(I suck at motivating people; I hope that this essay-like mess was at least somewhat coherent... it&#039;s 1am here, to boot, so you&#039;ll have to forgive me. I tried.)]]></description>
