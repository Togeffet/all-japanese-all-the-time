					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly how I felt during my kanji phase. At first I thought it would be a great idea to create my own Kanji deck but I realized how tedious that is. So instead I downloaded a pre-made RTK deck. Then during the middle of the phase, I was beginning to get sick of making up my stories. so for most of the remaining kanji to be learned I decided to use RevTek site to finish the process quicker by using someones story. But nevertheless I got RTK through anyways. Haha]]></description>
