					<description><![CDATA[I agree 100%. I&#039;m not studying Japanese exactly (I practice writing kanji for fun, but that&#039;s about it), but I&#039;m an accent reduction coach for foreign learners of English, and I have a lot of experience with teaching Japanese speakers to make a perfect American &#039;r&#039;. A couple of years back I ran across a newspaper article that said it&#039;s impossible for Japanese speakers to ever learn to make a perfect American &#039;r&#039;. Probably the author had asked some English teacher who had never been able to teach it successfully herself. Glad nobody told me that before I started doing it -- and I hope no Japanese English-learners ever get exposed to that nonsense and get discouraged. Sounds like there&#039;s similar nonsense in the other direction concerning English-speakers learning Japanese. I like your attitude about it.Â ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Somewhat related is the spiel some people vomit about how Japanese is a &quot;useless&quot; language and an utter waste of time to learn. They say you should learn Mandarin or Cantonese or Spanish or some random Middle Eastern language because they&#039;re more &quot;useful&quot; and will earn you the big bucks in Corporate America.

Because learning for the sake of learning -- and not simply to earn more money -- is something only a fool would do, am I right?

Those people I auto-ignore with extreme prejudice. Interestingly, the people who tend to make this assheaded proclamation are usually monolingual and brazenlyÂ Anglo-centrist... Take that how you will. =/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well - I think his point is that, out of your available resources, you should listen to those that are furthest along on that path. In the case of Japanese, there are enough people that went from A to X that you don&#039;t have to listen to M. Whereas with Pluto - nobody is at X, so your best bet is to listen to the guy at M and then figure it out from there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re stretching the sentiment past the logical breaking pointâ€”following the argument, this means that if you&#039;re trying to get to Pluto or Tau Ceti, NASA&#039;s opinion doesn&#039;t matter, which seems more than a little suspect.

Now, I do think there is an argument about the difference between physical travel with well-understood natural laws and the ability to do things like calculate with fair precision how much energy/work it takes to get from where person X has been to where you&#039;re trying to go and something like language learning where the theory is all off in the weeds and imprecise, but suddenly the nice, neat, catchy slogan is gone.]]></description>
