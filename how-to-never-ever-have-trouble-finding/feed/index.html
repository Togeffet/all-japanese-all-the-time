					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s unfortunate that the price of this is closing in on $3000 USD now. I feel like some spin on a dutch auction would be more amusing and less punishing to late-comers. Oh well. I&#039;ll just have to continue winning on my own. :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does this have content divided by level of difficulty or something like that? I&#039;m interested into drowning myself in the Korean language (Aaaahhhh~), but right now I&#039;m doing the search myself, giving preference to really noob content first (kid or baby stuff).

One thing I wonder is where all this hate towards Linux comes from :P (not the first post I saw with this kind of content). Someone who deliberately puts stuff like that on posts not related whatsoever is asking for some rage. But I&#039;m glad people don&#039;t take it seriously.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried this yesterday, and in one word it&#039;s amazing! Worth the money, but I can&#039;t afford the lifetime price, sadly. I&#039;ve received loads of native material. So much that it&#039;s a bit overwhelming. It&#039;s worth the money!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Moneypaks can be purchased locally and transferred into a paypal account.
You&#039;d only know if you try. 

I&#039;d try it too, but that hefty price tag is still too much for me.
I guess I&#039;ll torrent one year of textbooks, or sell my kidney.
The for-life deal tho.. mm]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh well, too bad it only works with credit card for the daily plan. Is there a way you could possibly change that?
I really wanted to, you know, kinda, try it and see if its worth my incredibly and absolutely (not) hard earned money.
Thanks.]]></description>

If I ever had a way to pay for things over the internet, rest assured, I would be hitting that silver spoon like it owed me money. This also, seems like a pretty good idea.]]></description>
