I found three addons for chrome that do something like that:

This one doesn&#039;t support Japanese though:

					<description><![CDATA[Has anyone thought of this program...
when you are browsing on the internet, the program would
translate the most common 5 - 10 words(verbs adjective, adverbs, nouns only)
into your L2 using google translate. Then everyday, or after a certain amount
of time has passed 4-8hrs of reading, the program adds a few more words to
the list of what gets translated. This keeps going till all words that can be
translated are translated.
just an Idea and if anyone decides to do it please let me know.
I think it would make learning through reading easier because you would
be learning the L2 words through context or by google translate if you need to.
It would be a painless way to acquire literacy in a language with a
completely different writing system.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Become who you were born to be. Become Japanese.&quot; BEST. ADVICE. EVER.

Anyway, definitely some great tips here; the only problem I have in implementing them (besides chronic „ÅäÈáë„Åå„Å™„ÅÑ) is I&#039;m not old enough to move out yet. So the only place I can actually change all the way is my laptop, and even then it&#039;s semi-limited for technical reasons (programs only having English versions, font fail, etc).

					<description><![CDATA[You may never read this, since it was posted a million years ago, but I just thought I&#039;d brag here, since you mentioned them a couple times in this article...I grew up rocking out with Matt Mahaffey and the other guys in the band Self. When I was like 16 their first album dropped and this girl I *knew* (--like in a biblical sense lol) was good friends with Matt&#039;s sister or cousin, so I got to go to house parties at Matt&#039;s house like every weekend while they were just starting to get big (I&#039;m talking back when Cannon was just blowing up on the radios in the Nashville area).  They used to put me on the list at the local bars they played like &quot;Tha Boro&quot; and &quot;Wall Street&quot; so I could come watch their shows despite being REALLY underage and looking about 12.  Anyways, its just fun to have bragging rights about something, yeah?  I actually burned out on their music years ago, so it definitely isnt a huge temptation to my environment, like it apparently was for someone... But, they were (are?) a great band, and Matt is a really cool, down to earth guy.  Cool enough to let a kid hang out with a bunch of guys on their way up as rock stars, even if they have always remained moderately &quot;underground&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, this article really helped me with the immersion process.  I like the &quot;Before you jump, make sure you have somewhere to land&quot; Idea.  No sense in starting without the actual materials to replace it with!  

Great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have some anime and stuff that I bought as a teenager that I can use to study, but I really would like to take your suggestion and trade a bunch of my English stuff with Japanese versions. Any idea where/how I can do something like that? I know there are sites like swaptree, but that&#039;s just exchanging English books for English books, really... Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this Site Khatz but i hasve a couple problems #1 most gigantic problem is im only 14 and i have no money so i rely on lime wire and bittorrent to get all the materials and unfourtunately for me my mom is the hot tempered puertorican budget cutting type and 2 ive never taken a clas and dont speak a lick  of jpapanese exept for the basics and was wonder ing in addition to immersion if i should use rosseta stone in my regimne before my kanji if its any use what are your thoughts ETC. but otther than that this site is really good and really psychological i always thought language is like learning the guitar because the only real way to lean is to feel it its not a technical thing you just become the guitar an extension of your body just like language is an extension of your mind]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So this is from way long ago and you may never read this comment Khatzu, BUT... it&#039;s related to immersion environment so i&#039;m posting it anyway. 

i&#039;m an ALT (on the JET program) who was shown your website by a senpai. From the moment I read the first sweet, sweet line, I knew I was hooked. BUT. I&#039;m an ALT. And I take ESL very seriously. As in, it&#039;s very important that my students are receiving quality English instruction, such that I spend most of my day on the computer researching in ENGLISH. Sure my office buddies are chattering away in Japanese, but I&#039;d be fooling myself if I said that it was anything but background noise to me. Other than at work your website, remembering the kanji, or my girlfriend are the only sources of English that tend to disturb my Japanese immersion. What do you think? Since so much of my time is spent at work, I *want* that environment to be Japanese as well. I&#039;m sure there are texts in Japanese about ESL, but the amount of time it would require me to parse through those articles would significantly lower my productivity (which is already not kanpeki). Based on your own experiences, what would you recommend doing? I know you took notes in Japanese, was there a point where you searched for textbooks in Japanese as well? Or did you stop the immersion at note-taking? Are there other ALTs who frequent this site that have recommendations?]]></description>
