					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, I used to be a dishwasher at a restaurant for about two years, long before I stumbled upon this site. I was a junior in high school at the time and it seriously sucked to wash everybody&#039;s filth. I figured out a way to get through the nights though by basically doing what you suggest to do with Japanese (or any other language for that matter). I played games while washing them. I used these square-like dish holders and some games were how fast could I fill the holder or how many could I do in an hour. My favorite game was seeing the holder like a Tetris board and fitting the different sizes and shapes of dishes onto the holder while taking up the most space, it was awesome. Just like with Japanese, just gotta keep moving and have fun! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another good resource for input is nicovideo.jp, which is like YouTube, but more suited to the Japanese audience.  They do not discriminate against people outside of Japan, and you can register a username for free anywhere in the world to be able to watch videos.  One really cool feature they have that YouTube lacks is that comments are always attached to a certain time on the video and when you get to the time that a comment is attached to on the video, the comment scrolls across the video.  It&#039;s really cool and lets you see more closely how Japanese people are reacting to things, I think.

					<description><![CDATA[So, about that Twitter message...
&#062;I&#039;m thinking TV commercials have immense untapped power as a language-learning tool. 
Not sure what you mean with the &quot;untapped&quot; part Khatz, but this is definitely true. Commercials contain piles words you hardly encounter anywhere else when you don&#039;t happen to live in the country where they speak the language. Movies and video games are great for learning foreign languages, but you don&#039;t ever see anyone talk of everyday stuff like doing the laundry in them. 
Plus, commercials nowadays are usually funny, well-thought out and extremely polished pieces of entertainment rather than boring announcements. I&#039;ve learned tons of new English words just through browsing Youtube for funny commercials.
Too bad most TV networks still insist on ignoring the internet as an international distribution medium, DVDs and illegal rips don&#039;t come with ads (other than that &quot;LOL U BAWT HOUR DVD, UR A PIRATE!!!1!&quot; crap)]]></description>
