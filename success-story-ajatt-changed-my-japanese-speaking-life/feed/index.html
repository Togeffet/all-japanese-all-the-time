					<description><![CDATA[Better late than never right?¬†
I&#039;ve pretty much only searched for Japanese music in English so I&#039;d say try that. Also depending on what genre you like, type it into Google and see what others have said,this is how I found tons of artists. I was having difficulties finding what I liked at first but then I broaden the search a bit. Now my iPod is full of J-RnB (Crystal Kay is awesome)¬†and a bit of J-Pop. Good luck searching.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After reading this article I was wondering if there was an application for android with podcasts in japanese and I think I found one.... The name is TOP Podcasts, developed by John Woo....It&#039;s one of the firsts that apears, I didn&#039;t try the others that apear

Thanks to this article I can listen to something else than &quot;anime&quot; - I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s called like that in English *I&#039;m Brazilian* - all day long!
By the way I&#039;m unable to find decent japanese music, that&#039;s why I only watch &quot;anime&quot; all day long. 
Can SOMEONE, ANYONE, please tell me where to find it?
Now that I&#039;m thinking of it I&#039;ve never searched in english and neither in japanese itself, I only searched in portuguese, can this be the problem?Or it&#039;s dificult to find when you don&#039;t know what to look for?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[heh, I have to agree. 

Khatz: &lt;em&gt;Has AJATT helped you? What‚Äôs your success story? Share.&lt;/em&gt;
¬†
I thought about what to say, but I couldn&#039;t really come up with anything because on some levels I&#039;m successful, and not on others. Like, I know the kanji and even can read some sentences, but I can&#039;t even read a paragraph, let alone a page in a book. I came to the conclusion that there are really only two ways to define success in Japanese: 1) by being fluent, and 2) by moving in the right direction. I&#039;m moving in the right direction, so I consider myself successful&lt;em&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Got any suggestions where I can easily get this quantity of Japanese immersion stuff, &lt;em&gt;without using iTunes&lt;/em&gt;? I can&#039;t use that program ever again after what it did to my music collection a few years back (long story short, a &quot;bug&quot;, that I doubt they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to fix, labeled ALL unwatermarked files as stolen and autodeleteable, including my large collection of game soundtracks... thank goodness for USB backups)...
The only places I know of are Japan-A-Radio (inaccessible at school due to the college firewall portblocking all audio streaming), Youtube (which I can&#039;t find anything on without knowing what to look for, so when I&#039;m able to use JAR at home, I write down all the song titles and albums and look them up later on YT... not very efficient, only semi-effective), and Nicovideo (same problem as Youtube, with the additional issue of KeepVid being incompatible with the Nico Player).]]></description>

Don&#039;t assume that his podcasts are the key to unlocking Japanese. I&#039;m sure if you ask Lou where he heard about the podcasts he is referring to, he might just say, &quot;I just browsed and picked at random...&quot;

What I am trying to say is, just get on your iTunes, change that country settings and start browsing. Quantity over quality.

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t speak on the matter of class-work since I&#039;ve never taken a class in Japanese. But I will say that before I found your site, I was studying on my own for about a year, and was doing okay, but then, your site came along and I started immersing in funner (I know, not a word) ways and something happened, something great. I realized that the &#039;fun&#039; things I was doing had a lot of high-frrquency vocab, grammar, usage, etc. So, in turn, I started finally understanding what you meant by... &quot;DON&#039;T LEARN A LANGUAGE, GET USED TO IT!&quot;

I am at 1yr and a half, give or take, with Japanese and am more motivated than ever. Thanks to the advice given here.

Many, Many thanks for that.

ps.
Before your site, I had about 15 anki decks... now, I have 4. Life. Easier. Success.
