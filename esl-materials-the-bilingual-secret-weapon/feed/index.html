					<description><![CDATA[Textbooks are dangerous, man, I got two paper-cuts from mine today!

Seriously though, everyone in my class is bored out of their minds during English. The teacher&#039;s solution? MOAR EXCERCISES. We got 18 A4 pages of fill-the-gap exercises today. I wish I was kidding. Then again, our teacher explicitly stated that he is not trying to teach us actual, real-life English, he is focusing on preparing us for our exams. 

/rant over 

This is an interesting suggestion, though. I can still remember the feeling of &quot;I wish I could speak English already&quot;. It would be interesting to take a look at how they learn this language in countries other than mine. And learn some Japanese in the process!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Signed up for several ESL weekly email things.

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, I had a look at some IELTS books for Japanese speakers at university, a few days ago; and some of the &quot;break questions&quot; seemed to have been designed to drive anyone reading them up the wall. (If I remember correctly, you had to read a wall of text consisting mostly of &quot;cat&quot;, with the occasional &quot;bat&quot;, or some other word thrown in, and either read it aloud, or write it out by hand).

I&#039;m sure that some of the example sentences were also pretty dull/stupid, by most standards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget podcasts- I like the BBC Learning English podcasts aimed at Chinese learners of English. The older version of the podcasts (was called &#039;Ask About Britain&#039;; don&#039;t think they&#039;re the same anymore) have clips of English people answering questions, with lots of natural Chinese translations and explanations. 

Books in China are really cheap and I have lots of learning English ones- the English is terrible and I feel sorry for the people learning from them, but the Chinese is great for me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for that Asahi-press link, hadn&#039;t come across that before.
Do these examples of 熟語や連語 look legit? I&#039;m STILL working on the kanji.
