					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I just read some of your articles and just wanted to say that I&#039;m really glad I finally found someone with whom I think I share all the thoughts about language learning acquisition. There is just so much BS out there... you know.
I&#039;ll probably end up reading all your articles these days.

Just wanted to say that for now. 
Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’m sorry to contradict what you’re saying (not to be rude, but..) I’ve gotta put my two cents in here before someone gets hurt. &#062;.&#060;;&#034;

Natalie, believe me , no one is being hurt here. As you see, people are enjoying in their L2,L3 etc...

&#034;Ask any exchange student (or my now quad-lingual Sweedish friend): the best way to learn a language is to TALK.. You need to practice putting thoughts in your head into words. (not matter what the result is!) It is proof of what you are really retaining/can use on the fly.&#034;

So basically one can talk about things one doesn&#039;t know? Is there some kind of language source that we don&#039;t know (apart from the brain)?
Also, I am now in a foreign country and I am surrounded by exchange and foreign students, 99%of them were required to have at least intermediate knowledge of language (German) and then they were sent to special preparatory schools to reach C1 level in German. Four months, 5 days/week, 4h/day plus self learning.So you see, that is a lot of daily input. 

&#034;At the beginning of my stay in Japan, I tried the input-before-output method (I thought the same: If I can think things in Japanese, I will definitely be able to say them later!), and it failed miserably (MISERABLY!!!).&#034;

So you decided to come to this site to warn others, not to make your mistakes and it is possible to think in a foreign language and not being able to speak. That is something new. 
How much input did you put? 10 000 sentences. All Japanese All the Time?

 &#034;I only began becoming fluent when I made daily efforts to produce sentences and messages. So what if my grammar was a little off?&#034;

So what is the difference between your method and AJATT? 10 000 sentences, most of them written also with the hand.

 &#034;I was always monitoring what I was hearing and saying, and listening to how native speakers word their sentences and use certain words. It didn’t take longer than a week for me to be able to fix a mistake I had been making for the past few months.&#034;

Again , explained several times on this site , how to imitate Native speaker. 

I don’t speak English perfectly some of the time (everyone makes mistakes; even after being immersed in perfect English nearly my entire life), and I speak Japanese perfectly much less than that; but the point is I am making an effort and in turn making an improvement.

Everyone is making effort. The difference is that with AJATT you don&#039;t feel psychologically abused compared to regular classes, grammar drills, output pressure etc... You feel happy and in turn make better progress than &#034;monitoring&#034; obsessed individuals.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Natalie said: &quot;Ask any exchange student (or my now quad-lingual Sweedish friend): the best way to learn a language is to TALK..&quot;

Actually, every single person I&#039;ve ever asked who&#039;s learned to speak my L1 (English) fluently has told me they&#039;ve learned it from watching lots of TV.  :-)

The one downside I see is the occasional awkward moment.  I was trying to read a Japanese book in a coffee shop recently, and some random guy comes up and asks (in Japanese) if I&#039;m studying Japanese.  I understood everything he said *perfectly*, but didn&#039;t know how to answer!  I stood there and nodded my head like an idiot.  「uh, はい？」]]></description>

Ask any exchange student (or my now quad-lingual Sweedish friend): &lt;b&gt;the best way to learn a language is to TALK&lt;/b&gt;.. You &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to practice putting thoughts in your head into words. (not matter what the result is!) It is proof of what you are really retaining/can use on the fly.
At the beginning of my stay in Japan, I tried the input-before-output method (I thought the same: If I can think things in Japanese, I will definitely be able to say them later!), and it failed miserably (MISERABLY!!!). I only began becoming fluent when I made daily efforts to produce sentences and messages. So what if my grammar was a little off? I was always monitoring what I was hearing and saying, and listening to how native speakers word their sentences and use certain words. It didn&#039;t take longer than a week for me to be able to fix a mistake I had been making for the past few months.

I don&#039;t speak English perfectly some of the time (everyone makes mistakes; even after being immersed in perfect English nearly my entire life), and I speak Japanese perfectly much less than that; but the point is &lt;b&gt;I am making an effort and in turn making an improvement.&lt;b&gt;

ps. I learned the kana before the kanji, and I wouldn&#039;t have had it any other way. There will always be more kanji to learn, but being able to write in kana is a giant step towards being able to fully immerse yourself in Japanese. (being able to write the words you don&#039;t know)]]></description>
