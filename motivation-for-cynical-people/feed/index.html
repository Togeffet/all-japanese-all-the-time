					<description><![CDATA[First, the hyperlink... I have no idea why that came up, wasn&#039;t trying to link anything... &#062;.&#062;
Okay, let me show you an example of how to use primitives. The kanji &lt;a&gt;ÈÄî&lt;/a&gt; - which is given the keyword &quot;route&quot; - is comprised of the primitives &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;road&quot;. This is how I would go about making the card:

Front:
&lt;a&gt;ÈÄî&lt;/a&gt;
Back:
ROUTE
SCALES line the ROAD which truck-drivers are forced to use as their ROUTE.

Note that on the back, I give the keyword in capitals, and in the sentence, I make sure that the primitives stand out by capitalizing them as well. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Are you referring to writing the kanji out on paper, or writing the sentence on the card? In either case, I‚Äôd recommend you do so. 
I was just talking about the kanji but okay. :D I&#039;ll do that then.
¬†
&#062;No worries! One example I can think of would be ‰Ωô, which is given the keyword, ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù In its primitive form, however, it‚Äôs known as ‚Äúscale‚Äù, like in &lt;a&gt;ÈÄî.&lt;/a&gt;
 ¬†
 &lt;a&gt;Hopefully this clarifies things!&lt;/a&gt;
¬†
&lt;a&gt;Again, I&#039;m sorry to bother you again but how would you use the primitive meanings in a sentence? Just say a story about a scale and not bother using other keywords for the other parts of the kanji and just use the main keyword for the over all kanji ? I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m being so slow..this should not be so hard..but it is for me..:(¬† Maybe I should just make a sentence with only the over all keyword if I can do such simples things..but I would probly forget the rest of the kanji then. 
&lt;/a&gt;
And, did you try and use a link in your post? I hovered over the parts that are highlighted in blue to indicate a link but it didn&#039;t come up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Take a deep breath! Kanji shouldn‚Äôt be stressful, in fact, some people find it relaxing. Stroke order was an issue for me as well. Just pay close attention in the earlier stages of RTK when Heisig shows the order, and by the time he stops showing it, you‚Äôll have developed the instinct that will allow you just just *know* how to write characters. As for getting keywords confused, I‚Äôm assuming this is because you aren‚Äôt using the Lazy Kanji method? Once you switch, this issue should go away. 
¬†Wow, so you shouldn&#039;t write it at all? O.o And about the Lazy Kanji method, how does it work if you don&#039;t have a story or anything to memorize it with? I was looking at the Lazy Kanji Deck Mod V2 and on the front of the cards, don&#039;t have anything to give you a clue on remembering them, they just have a blank for you to write¬† the kanji and a small red number. 
&#062;After some thought, I think you may be better off sticking with the primitive meanings. Sometimes, the primitives look fairly different from the original Kanji they come from, and also, you may run the risk of remembering the *entire* kanji by the keyword name that was given to the primitive. 
I think I understand but , could you give me an example? (Sorry for being slow. :/ )
&#062;Unfortunately no. My personal preference it to not use pre-built decks. To me, it feels like someone is just handing me work to do, not the labour-of-love feeling I get when I build my own decks. However, Google may know of some sources!
Ah, okay. To be honest, I&#039;m still kind of worried to make my own deck since, I&#039;m sure what would help me and it may take me a long while to learn kanji while wasting time finding a good deck. D: ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; I‚Äôve been stressing about stroke order AND the keywords then get confused when using other keywords to form parts of the kanji in my mind.

&#062;Like there would be a primitive for DAY in the kanji and then I‚Äôd try to remember DAY with the keyword for it in the sentence. Would that be doing it incorrectly if I‚Äôm doing that?

After some thought, I think you may be better off sticking with the primitive meanings. Sometimes, the primitives look fairly different from the original Kanji they come from, and also, you may run the risk of remembering the *entire* kanji by the keyword name that was given to the primitive. 

&#062; Do you know of any good decks for Anki perchance?xD

					<description><![CDATA[When going through RTK, my card format was as follows:

Front:
Â•¥
Back:
GUY
A WOMAN&#039;s CROTCH interests a GUY.

On the front is the kanji, and on the back is the keyword, as well as the sentence with the primitives in all capitals. (The sentences are critical if you&#039;re doing Heisig&#039;s Remembering The Kanji. Don&#039;t leave them out. If you&#039;re trying to learn kanji simply through repetition, then a sentence is unnecessary... I&#039;d strongly recommend RTK over drilling though...)
Something I found interesting is that if I did the cards like this, I&#039;d be able to remember the meaning of the kanji when reading Japanese text, but have trouble writing them. If the card was flipped, the opposite would be true. However, seeing how - in my opinion - input is more important output, I figured I should put more effort into reading than writing, and, about 5 months post RTK, I still stand by my decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Going back through a lot of these posts now that I&#039;m AJATT + 4 months (with seven years of &#039;study&#039; and unintentional exposure of various degrees before that&#039;.

Yeah, I am feeling more rooted in Japanese than ever before. Today I picked up Âùä„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì just to see how hard I found it compared to a year earlier (too hard to read enjoyably, so I put it down). I found I could pretty much get the gist of any words I didn&#039;t know from context/kanji. I dare say I could now read the whole thing fairly enjoyably and without a dictionary (picking out things for SRS of course). Pretty happy about that I gotta say.

However it is certainly not like you learn a word and then you &#039;own&#039; it. Ownage typically comes a fair fair way down the line. You can&#039;t force it, you just gotta be patient and keep planting those seeds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I never say this, but I think this post saved my life - relatively speaking of course. I didn&#039;t think anyone else that actually achieved thought like this. (sounds silly, I&#039;m aware.)

For some reason I can&#039;t feel that &#039;passion&#039; or &#039;pull to any path&#039; sort of thing. I decided to go about Japanese in a different way this time (as opposed to my past failed experiences). By just not thinking too much about the future or complexities that I have yet to face - all of which have caused me inevitable failure before. As you said, by simply planting the seed, caring for it each day, and see what happens. 

A sort of go with the flow approach in terms of progress, idk. 

Thanks though. Will continue reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, yes. Thank you. I am exactly that kind of cynical person (!) and while I just decided to re-try the AJATT method (after finally getting back into college and being profoundly disappointed with the quality of the language classes), I&#039;ve been doubting. But, as you said, really I&#039;ve been doubting the wrong things, haven&#039;t I? After all, it&#039;s unlikely I&#039;ll fail quite as spectacularly as I seemed to think I would (I have nightmares about accidentally wiping my memory clear, or somehow learning to pronounce all my vowels wrong...). Wish me luck! (or, perhaps more appropriate, wish me hard work, as the Japanese would say...) ^_^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really do appreciate it when ya take the time to make these inspirational posts!  :) 

I&#039;ve only recently really kicked my learning into gear again.  I&#039;ve even cancelled my WoW account and started playing the japanese version of mabinogi.  It is amazing how much I can understand while understanding so little. Also, I just pre-ordered Dragon Quest IX from Play-Asia off of your referral link.  Hope you get your commission!

Thanks again!]]></description>

If you can‚Äôt feel passion [I hate this word], don‚Äôt. Just be curious instead. Just keep sowing instead.

AJATT runs on wit, passion and your support!
