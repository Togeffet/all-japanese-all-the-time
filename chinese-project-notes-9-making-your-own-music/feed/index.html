So can&#039;t really tell about where this path is going to lead but tell you that I&#039;ve read the sinopsis of ラブコン and now I&#039;m a little unsure if I should watch it or not.

Classical Chinese wasn&#039;t authentically spoken for much longer after the Warring States period, probably at most till the mid-Han dynasty. The pronunciation had changed a lot by the Tang dynasty; tones weren&#039;t originally in &quot;Old Chinese&quot;, the basis for Classical Chinese, as many scholars claim. They did develop by Middle Chinese during the Tang Dynasty though. The Tang period is when &#039;Classical Chinese&#039; spread through (North-)East Asia; the Tang poems, Buddhist scriptures etc, are in this language, which does emulate quite successfully (I think) the grammar of REAL &quot;classical chinese&quot; (Warring States Chinese) though the pronunciation is drastically different (rhymes don&#039;t work in many cases for example). The Nanyue regions (modern Guangdong and the surroundings) were also conquered during the Tang period by the Han Chinese, Cantonese developed from the Han settlers&#039; Middle Chinese with some influence from the natives, and is thus more conservative in some areas than the northern dialects.

 OK, but all that was slightly OOT, suffice to say, the Japanese have also been studying Classical Chinese for centuries and they need dictionaries to aid their studies as well, so they developed this dictionary for Classical Chinese (文言文 in Chinese) with definitions in Japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chiro-kun,
to tell the truth, I&#039;m not writing the sentences down lately. Until a couple of weeks ago I was using the pronunciation-&#062;expression method suggested by Khatz in a recent post. During that time I wrote down most of the sentences and it was a good kanji exercise as well (I&#039;ve been meaning to write a small report on my experience with this method. I&#039;ll probably do it next week). The only downside is that it takes some time.
Lately my schedule has gotten somewhat tight, so I temporarily switched back to expression-&#062;pronunciation with no writing down the sentences.

Anyway, I would suggest you write at least some of the sentences down, because writing individual kanji is not the same thing. You need to exercise the kana too, and the &quot;flow&quot; of continuous writing (I write them vertically instead of horizontally to get used to their mentality).]]></description>

It contains great pieces of comedy but from episode 8 on it becomes an almost strictly romantic series but still, enjoyable for the profound story.

					<description><![CDATA[@nacest -
Ok this is the last question (promise :) ). Do you write down all sentences in your SRS? I mean, since you practice Kanji everyday do you need to write the separate entries themselves?

@Nivaldo - 
Don&#039;t know about お願いティーチャー since I haven&#039;t watched it but try クラナド or みなみけ. They both have a LOT of natural words and to top it みなみけ is slice of life. Yeah I fully agree about ナルト/One Piece (which sucks because I&#039;m a great One Piece fan myself :( ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz! How&#039;re you doing? Look, I was surfing through your site and when I read the &quot;Are you a three day monk?&quot; article&#039;s comments I found a very useful comment of yours concerning Native Japanese Words. So I stopped going for ナルト and デスノート and instead picked up all the episodes of おねがいティーチャー(got somewhat addicted to it :D. Not that I&#039;m romantic or something like that). Do you think I made a good choice? Also, what do you think of grouping &quot;key comments&quot; into some kind of group like &quot;Key Comments&quot; attach it to the groups you already have at the top of the page? I mean, among comments there are some very nice and helpful ones. By grouping them, it would make searching easier if necessary at all.
About  おねがいティーチャー&#039;s choice, I would like to hear the opinion of other people as well? As from I what I&#039;ve seen, this anime has much more natural words than ナルト or デスノート among others.
Finally, good job &quot;Making your own music&quot;. :D]]></description>

So I stopped going for ナルト and デスノート and instead picked up all the episodes of おねがいティーチャー(got somewhat addicted to it :D. Not that I&#8217;m romantic or something like that). Do you think I made a good choice? Also, what do you think of grouping &#8220;key comments&#8221; into some kind of group like &#8220;Key Comments&#8221; attach it to the groups you already have at the top of the page? I mean, among comments there are some very nice and helpful ones. By grouping them, it would make searching easier if necessary at all.<br />
About  おねがいティーチャー&#8217;s choice, I would like to hear the opinion of other people as well? As from I what I&#8217;ve seen, this anime has much more natural words than ナルト or デスノート among others.<br />
Finally, good job &#8220;Making your own music&#8221;. 😀</p>

					<description><![CDATA[漢字そのまま　DS楽引辞典
From what I can tell it&#039;s a good dictionary. Its definitions may be slightly less simple than the sanseido ones (and the Challenge ones), but it&#039;s still very clear.

But the main reason I like it is that it&#039;s soooooo handy. After I got it I was finally able to read manga and books (well I&#039;m still reading my first book :P) in Japanese while in bed, because I&#039;m not bound to big paper dics or to the PC for the web-based ones.

As for kanji, yes, I&#039;m still reviewing them on the kanji.koohii.com site. It&#039;s been 6 months since I&#039;ve finished RTK, and now the average daily workload is ~18 cards. It takes something like 10 minutes a day :)]]></description>

You mean 楽引そのまま漢字辞典 right?
How&#039;s the 国語辞典 in that one? I might plan on buying it....

Another general question to those who have completed Heisig:
Do you guys keep reviewing your kanji? For me, it&#039;s been around 2-3 months and I&#039;m gradually starting to forget the meanings and stroke orders.....]]></description>
