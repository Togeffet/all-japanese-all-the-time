					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Language immersion: Nope, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know Irish language speakers right now. It’s not enough of an excuse! Use our modern Irish Gaelic media online to immerse yourself in the language, and in Ireland’s culture. You don’t need to understand Irish Gaelic to immerse yourself, rather you’ll understand because you immerse yourself. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a really good tip for remembering the meanings of kanji. If you seriously cannot remember the meaning of this one kanji without writing it down and referring to it when you need to, don&#039;t use English definitions. Draw a picture. Write another kanji that reminds you of the meaning. Don&#039;t use English. I did this a few times and it was amazing. A picture sticks better in my memory rather than an English word. I&#039;ve written millions of words, but every picture I&#039;ve drawn is different from all the others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatzu-san

I had a question come up when I was reading this post. How did you manage to make your Japanese friends to just sit around to listen to? If it was in Japan, then I suppose that is different. But, I am worried about how to make new Japanese friends if I am not good enough yet to speak to anyone? I imagine after making friends, just sitting and listening is easy enough. But, is there some kind of phrase I can use to ask them if I can be their friend or something? Thanks for the help.

And awesome job on the posts as always!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m fascinated by your method and your accomplishment. I&#039;m in a situation which does not allow me to follow your method exactly and am looking for your opinion on a modified method.

I am finishing up my master&#039;s degree. I have some free time and am taking Japanese 101 at the University. In the Spring i&#039;ll take the second course. Not taking the class and doing only your method is not an option. I like the class, the people, and its a fun time. Anyway...

So, on the side I&#039;ve started to learn the Kanji with Heisig method. I&#039;ve also began the development of an immersion environment, as much as possible. The difference is that, we&#039;ve already learned Hiragana and are reading/writing sentences with additional grammar points. We&#039;ll also learn Katakana in a few weeks. Obviously this is not your recommended ordering.

So, the question is how can I optimize my situation? It is unrealistic with my time-constraints that I&#039;ll be able to finish RTK1 by Spring (probably 1000 Kanji). On the other hand I feel like I should be learning sentences, though I only have Kana to work with.

Should I just learn at the same pace as the class is designed, and then focus on finishing RTK? Or do you have any insights?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;it took me forever to figure out exactly what that meant
I bet it did! I know just what you mean, a lot of those took ages to sink in for me. BUT...guess what? You FIGURED IT OUT. All by yourself, right? Generally speaking, there is no way to look these up as such because they ARE non-standard and are created by authors on the fly. You just keep doing your thing, just keep reading and watching and listening, and it&#039;ll come to you. Sooner or later, it will come to you. Look at it this way--no Japanese kid was ever told what those meant, they just figured it out. When you &quot;get&quot; Japanese enough, and how it works, when you&#039;ve been exposed to it enough, you gain the ability to very accurately predict and/or infer what an author will say or is saying. So just keep going. If all else fails, ask someone. A friend from Japan, me, Google, anyone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been studing japanese for a year and feel I havent gotten very far, like Ive reached a plateau.  Mainly because after my first 2 and only japanese classes offered at my college, I had no direction.  Well, actually thats not even about my question.  I just found you page today, and totally agree about ALL japanese ALL the time.  BUT . . . As a part of emersion, and just general spoken japanese there is a lot Im not getting.  Mainly slang and stuff that I hear in dramas and movies.  Ive tried looking things up but its colloquial, and I only can ever guess at the meaning.
for example pronouncing iu (to say) as yuu. and using it in phrases like &quot;sou yuu koto desu ne&quot;  it took me forever to figure out exactly what that meant and what the heck &quot;yuu&quot; was.  Do you have any suggestions for looking up meaning for things that only a japanese person or a person in japan would know??  
Thanks.

PS  LOVE THE SITE!!!!!!!!!!  Its exactly what Ive been looking for.  URESHII!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You know, I really hate myself for not knowing more kanji.  I have all these lists, but little memorization.  I can read more than I can write.  My first goal is to learn the elementary school kanji (about a 1000), just so I can read different comics more and stuff and have them be more accessible.  But that isn&#039;t all, I want to also be completely literate.  I&#039;m thinking, after the first 1000 it would be easier, but even after that it would still be a bit of a struggle.

If, however, I continue my present attitude that I&#039;m going to get it, then even with these steps they shouldn&#039;t be a problem.  I have all these lists, but little methodology.  I guess this is where classes help best.  I wonder about Japanese children: I know they actually learn kanji more from reading them, but they have the advantage of hearing the readings and instantly knowing the meaning, while I with my still lacking vocabulary have to go with one or the other or both with extra effort.  Now, I don&#039;t want to learn kanji with English meanings in mind, so some methods I will exclude.

When I run them in the khatzumemo, I come across it and then write it on a piece of paper and guess the readings.  I judge myself based on how confident I am in writing it without seeing it first and based on how many readings I can remember.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;Also, do you have file format information on Mnemosyne XML?
I didn&#039;t really have information on it as such. All I did was make a Mnemosyne file, then look at it to find the pieces I wanted. KhatzuMemo is written in PHP, and as I recall PHP has a built-in XML parsing function, so I just used that. So, I don&#039;t have a deep knowledge of it or anything, all I did was pick out the question and answer text, I didn&#039;t look at the other fields because I didn&#039;t fully get what they meant, and didn&#039;t want to go to the trouble of asking the author. Sorry :(! But, yeah, try the Mnemosyne guy, he&#039;ll know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[khatzumoto,

Right.  On khatzumemo you can upload those XML files.  Because you programmed this into khatzumemo, this implies that you understand the format of the XML files or at least know where to go for a description of it.  Could you do that for me?  It&#039;s more annoying to have to go through the source code of Mnemosyne to try to figure it out. :p

As for mistakes, yah, that&#039;s about what I was meaning too.  I think that effort of society helps to prevent the language from evolving faster than it does.  Chomskey, et al., like to put that a child more or less speaks perfectly by age 5, that assumption doesn&#039;t really hold.  Also, a Kanji reading error like you described (the reading of the second Kanji is a valid reading of it, just not for this) seems like it could be a native error anyway.

I agree that if you&#039;re ploughing on with a horrible accent and inventing more prolificly (OMG sp?  See? total native error.) than Thomas Edison completely novel grammatical forms, all in an effort to &quot;just communicate&quot; your thoughts, then you&#039;re going backwards, putting the cart before the horse.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;the kid somehow ends up correcting himself.
Well, like you said, the kid is surrounded by condescending adults, cruel peers and watchful teachers who won&#039;t let her get away with minor errors. This is a great thing. For adults who may not have that kind of pressure around them, the best thing is to avoid mistakes altogether. Sure, you might still make them--I did, I do [like when, 2 weeks ago, I read &quot;本望&quot; as &quot;ほんぼう&quot;: the correct reading is &quot;ほんもう&quot;]--but there&#039;s a world of difference between a 1% mistake rate and a 30-50+% mistake rate.

Anyway, like I&#039;ve said before, I just followed AntiMoon&#039;s advice on this. And had the confidence that my brain would start putting out correct sentences after sufficient input. Just like you can recite movie dialogue and TV commercials without output practice, after sufficient viewings.]]></description>

Sure, you might still make them&#8211;I did, I do [like when, 2 weeks ago, I read &#8220;本望&#8221; as &#8220;ほんぼう&#8221;: the correct reading is &#8220;ほんもう&#8221;]&#8211;but there&#8217;s a world of difference between a 1% mistake rate and a 30-50+% mistake rate.</p>
<p>Anyway, like I&#8217;ve said before, I just followed AntiMoon&#8217;s advice on this. And had the confidence that my brain would start putting out correct sentences after sufficient input. Just like you can recite movie dialogue and TV commercials without output practice, after sufficient viewings.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, interesting.  I was reading this article:

http://www.zompist.com/whylang.html

which suggests that young peers&#039; cruelty may be a big factor in how a person can develop a knowledge of the narrow range of correctness in a language:

&quot;Their [children&#039;s] peers are nastier [than adults&#039;]. Embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human beings (I owe this insight to Marvin Minsky&#039;s The Society of Mind, but it was most memorably expressed by David Berlinski (in Black Mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to depression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full original intensity). Dealing with a French waiter is nothing compared with the vicious reception in store for a child who speaks funny.&quot;

This I find interesting.  It does seem that children make mistakes at first when learning their native language, but they always end up correcting themselves, despite this history of bad output.  I don&#039;t mean to equivocate this with an adult who just ploughs on with a bad accent and broken grammar (try John Mayer) without a care in the world and just wanting to express themselves (I saw this kind of person in Japan back in late June, early July), but it seems that if you have already had sufficient input when you start speaking, even if you make a few mistakes here and there, as long as your pronunciation is good (read perfect) and you have a good idea of the grammar, it wouldn&#039;t be as bad.  A kid who is starting out seems to have near perfect pronunciation (perhaps still messing up things like &#039;th&#039; and &#039;r&#039;), but just OK grammar.  It&#039;s just the kid somehow ends up correcting himself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[khatzumoto,

&quot;Funny story–I had one friend, who’s Japanese born and raised, but is actually of Korean ancestry. Due to a kind of national pride thing, she initially wouldn’t speak Japanese to me, even though it was her first and best language (her Korean is super rusty, she never uses it). So the silent deal was that she spoke in English and I spoke in Japanese. She is one of my good friends, but has the BIGGEST mean streak, so she would correct me mercilessly. If I paused mumbled she’d go “hurry UP!!”. If I said something wrong or odd, she’d go: “I don’t understand what you’re saying!! Your Japanese SUCKS, dude!!”. So I had to speak natural-sounding, naturally-worded Japanese to her for her to even accept it; it sucked because she’d freely (and loudly) put me down in public, too, so I had to really raise my game. Anyway, as I got better, she eventually spoke Japanese to me about 80-90% of the time. I don’t know why I’m sharing this…&quot;

Hmm?  Was this in Japan?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;Am I doing more harm than good?
Yes. I think so. Better to listen to them. Have them speak Japanese to you. That&#039;s what I did, it was like &quot;just speak Japanese to me, and I have to work to understand it&quot;. Until you can more or less fully understand natural Japanese, it&#039;s best not to speak. Remember: it&#039;s better to have no output than to have bad output.

Funny story--I had one friend, who&#039;s Japanese born and raised, but is actually of Korean ancestry. Due to a kind of national pride thing, she initially wouldn&#039;t speak Japanese to me, even though it was her first and best language (her Korean is super rusty, she never uses it). So the silent deal was that she spoke in English and I spoke in Japanese. She is one of my good friends, but has the BIGGEST mean streak, so she would correct me mercilessly. If I paused or mumbled she&#039;d go &quot;hurry UP!!&quot;. If I said something wrong or odd, she&#039;d go: &quot;I don&#039;t understand what you&#039;re saying!! Your Japanese SUCKS, dude!!&quot;. So I had to speak natural-sounding, naturally-worded Japanese to her for her to even accept it; it sucked because she&#039;d freely (and loudly) put me down in public, too, so I had to really raise my game. Anyway, as I got better, she eventually spoke Japanese to me about 80-90% of the time. She speaks super-fast, by the way, at least it used to seem so; she never slowed down, dumbed down or de-slanged her Japanese for me. I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m sharing this...

Hmmm...What was my point...Oh--For one thing, your Japanese friends probably aren&#039;t being as harsh on you as they could be, because (to use a stereotype), they don&#039;t have that harsh, Korean frankness (anyone who has friends from Korea probably knows what I mean...or not...I don&#039;t know). Few people have the energy to correct every mistake you make, or the uevos to make you look bad; this is a problem. The other problem is they could just get USED to your brokenness and learn to parse it. So, yeah, listen. Input. Input. Input. Have your friends speak to you, have them take you around places (tag along with them on errands if you can; it would be a great learning opportunity), watch what they say and do. Treat them like parents whom you&#039;re observing and imitating.

When you&#039;re ready to speak, it will come out. Until then, just listen. Work on your comprehension. Until you can fully understand other people, you have no business speaking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What he said.  I&#039;ve found being here in Japan, that many folks find it too difficult (for them) to really have long conversation with you in a group unless you are one-on-one and they are really interested.  I usually just try to listen.  
   Thanks beneficii-  I was wondering the same thing also though.  Thought I was giving up a prime opportunity.  
   Another question Khatz-  I do have a couple close friends that are very patient.  I usually try to speak Japanese with them and it&#039;s very broken.  Am I doing more harm than good?]]></description>
