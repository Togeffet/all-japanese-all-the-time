					<description><![CDATA[Hi.
There is something i wanted to say/ask:

Will you, consider relooking Surusu anytime soon (with some css )?
I think a very few lines would do the trick and would litterally metamorphose the whole
thing. It would be much more pleasant to use.

Just a couple of lines so the tables would look super neat. Another few lines would make the rest look super nice too. This would make users super happy.

I also think this would result in an awesome Effort/result  ratio.]]></description>
