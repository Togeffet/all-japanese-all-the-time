					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, I&#039;m with you on the Shinagawa Prince, love that hotel. Shopping is great. Starbucks. Wine shop. Shinkansen, Narita Express, Yamanote, train to Haneda. For me that is the center of Japan. I made friends with the bartender at the Italian restaurant. There&#039;s a coffee shop there, where the owner went to Italy and won some barista contest. The shopping inside the Shinagawa station is great-cool things you can&#039;t find outside Japan.

By the way, I highly recommend Din Tai Fon in Takashimaya in Shinjuku-great Chinese dumplings.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How did you get the Alfonso book?  I&#039;ve looked for it before but it&#039;s not available (ie. out of print) everywhere I look.  I&#039;ve also been struck by the difference between what it&#039;s like in the Áî∞Ëàé and the conception of technology in Japan that we have in America.  However, I&#039;d say there are a lot of underlying reasons for not having insulation in the houses, for using kerosone heaters, and for not having an electronic gate until now.  Another example I can think of is that in the states we have those automatic lights that tell you when you can go during construction, and in Japan I&#039;ve seen a few, but it&#039;s a lot more common to see people waving flags.  My idea is that for jobs where machines could do it, they&#039;re reluctant to take peoples&#039; jobs away.  Also for insulation, I&#039;d say it&#039;s hard to change a lot of the older houses because they&#039;ve been there for a long time and weren&#039;t designed to ever have installation put in.  And it is pretty inefficient/wasteful to heat the whole house versus the one room you&#039;re using.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, and one more thing:

I understand what you mean by being scared at the whole interview process: the suits, the resumes, and all that.  That&#039;s part of the reason why I wanted to go into the sciences. The interview process (if you want to call it that) is much less formal, and in most ways the interview is for you to find the right advisor, not the other way around. I believe the reason you went and did your Japanese interviews was more about making your &#039;act&#039; become real than about &#039;playing the game&#039; or any of the other reasons you would interview for American companies.  You&#039;re trying not just to take your proficiency to the next level, but to actually live the language, at work and at play.  Basically you&#039;re living your motto to the fullest.

I suppose your answer to MZMZ&#039;s question was sufficient: sure you don&#039;t like to interview, but since it&#039;s in Japanese, it&#039;s an entirely different story. I don&#039;t know for sure if you liked interviewing in Japanese, but it&#039;s a heck of a lot more interesting than if you did them in English.  But my question is: if you&#039;re so scared of doing them in English, wouldn&#039;t you be that much more scared when you&#039;re doing them in Japanese, a language that still (at least up to Oct.2005) lags behind your English?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz,

Love your blog as always.

Just a couple things about your recent post:

I know people have already harped upon the advanced technology in Japan, and I&#039;ll be one of many people who&#039;ll tell you (including you) that there are some amazing stuff over there, but at least in the sciences, Japan is deficient when it comes to equipment.  I know they have that giant neutrino detector, but when it comes to &quot;simple&quot; things like electron microscopes, they are a bit strapped.  Wonder why so many people come to the States to do their research?

And about the „Åï„Åõ„Å¶È†Ç„Åè stuff.  There&#039;s a funny anecdote in Jay Rubin&#039;s book (Making Sense of Japanese) about coming across a sign that says Êú¨Êó•„ÅØ‰ºë„Åæ„Åõ„Å¶È†Ç„Åç„Åæ„Åô. He decided to make a plaque out of it and there it sits in his office to this day (from what I know).  He says that the politeness expressed by the sign is similar to English equivalents like &quot;thank you for not smoking&quot;, or &quot;gone fishin&#039;&quot; (OK, the last one is not so polite) and the usage has more force than a direct imperative sometimes.

Anyway that&#039;s me.  As always, keep up the great work!]]></description>

Oops! Sorry! I skipped over your comment accidentally when answering (don&#039;t worry, it wasn&#039;t offensive (lol) ).

&gt;So my question is: how did you manage to become skilled at something you dislike?
That&#039;s a really good question. I guess the whole willingness to play the game for the Bilingual  Career Forum was that I truly &lt;em&gt;wanted&lt;/em&gt; to live in Japan, and I genuinely had respect for all the cool things that had come out of this country and filled my childhood. So at the worst it was a &quot;means to an end&quot; thing. 

But with the regular American career forums, I was just being carried by the assumptions and values, the ÊµÅ„Çå,of people around me at college, namely: &quot;If [insert major American organization here] in all its glory and mercy decides to hire you, then thank the stars, for you are truly blessed&quot;...type thing? Truth be told, I hadn&#039;t even wanted to go to college in the first place, but I let myself get swept up into that ÊµÅ„Çå, too, and once I was in college, I played that game like it was my life. Stupid. Stupid.

Another issue may be that I was &quot;acting&quot; at Japanese anyway (like I&#039;ve discussed previously -- imitating speaking styles, usage and pronunciation). So, the &quot;acting&quot; at the career forum didn&#039;t feel as unnatural as it might have in English, where I&#039;ve been &quot;acting&quot; so long it seems more or less real.

It may well all come back to my attitude going in. At American career forums, I was sucking up. At the BCF, I was breaking the mold just by being non-Japanese at what was essentially a forum for Japanese kids who had been to college in the US (there were a few other non-Japanese kids there, too, and a Japanese-American guy...good people). So, it was a game, and I was playing on my on terms. I chose to learn keigo, where I didn&#039;t feel like I was actively choosing to do anything, in the US. Like many people, I&#039;d been in school almost my whole life (most of it boarding school, to boot)...and school isn&#039;t really in the business of teaching people to make actual, active life choices...

Anyway, as it happens working at a company isn&#039;t that hot; there are much smarter economic (and emotional...and intellectual) options, IMHO.

But, yeah, that&#039;s a really good question and I&#039;m not sure of the answer myself. But I guess one answer might be: I &lt;em&gt;didn&#039;t&lt;/em&gt; dislike doing the BCF interviews as such, I was scared to pieces, but I also saw it as a chance to prove my Japanese proficiency in a much more realistic and meaningful (and profitable) and direct way than something like the JL-freaking-PT.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto, you&#039;re not responding to my comment I take that maybe you are offended by it or are not sure what I&#039;m on about.

I seriously didn&#039;t mean any offense.

I know many people who are smart but don&#039;t look like it. They don&#039;t wear glasses, don&#039;t wear suits, don&#039;t use many words when talking, are super-humble when they have to say something about their skills. They don&#039;t act like wise people, yet they know their stuff. I always thought showing off is counter-productive and influences learning in a negative way. Yet, presenting skills is necessary on interviews, otherwise the interviewers may not believe you know the stuff you know, or am I mistaken somewhere?

&quot;I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to go through the suit-wearing, resume-writing, smiling motions.&quot; &#060;-- yet you decided to go through it anyway? Why? &quot;I realized that I wanted to go and make cool electronics&quot; &#060;-- Well ok but how were you able to become good at something you dislike so much? Is it even possible become skilled at something you don&#039;t like, even if the goal is something good?

IMHO The AJAT methods presented on this site are incredibly effective when it comes to improving the skills, but unlike college classes (which I don&#039;t like myself either) they don&#039;t make a person appear like he/she was doing something &quot;serious&quot; and was brainy. If someone centers his/her whole life around learning a language in such way he/she doesn&#039;t actively exercise the &quot;look at me I&#039;m smart&quot; skill. 

I&#039;m totally confused.]]></description>

You guys are right -- that was just sloppy writing on my part. The whole advanced technology deal was just my impression of what I saw of Shinagawa those 2.5 days. Later on, I, too, was as somewhat shocked to find people not using dishwashers or clothes dryers: &quot;wash dishes with HANDS?? Are you MAD?!&quot;]]></description>
