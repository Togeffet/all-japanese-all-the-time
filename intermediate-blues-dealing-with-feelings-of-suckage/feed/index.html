					<description><![CDATA[Not to brag, but it took me 5-6 years.

It was a slow process not to mention painful.  That and being surrounded by people who truly did not like me one bit(I was did not notice a few of such either to be honest).  My parents put said people in my life, some of them are still there to this day too(You know, the people who think they RULE you&#039;re entire life, the type whose arrogance makes you sick).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The best way to do get over doubts about a language is to put aside the doubts and break down what you know you can do for sure. 
You can learn words. That&#039;s a guarantee. Maybe you won&#039;t always understand the context, but it&#039;s easy learning a word. Look it up, look it up again, win.

Even if you know absolutely nothing about the sentence structure, one thing anyone without a significant mental retardation is guaranteed to be able to do is learn a word. Learn all the words within a sentence and you can piece them together. Even if you know all the words within a sentence but don&#039;t know the context of that specific sentence, there&#039;ll be sentences you can piece together that further clarify those sentences.

So keep being exposed to words. Keep absorbing words, and eventually you will be able to piece those words together to form a coherent sentence. It&#039;s like many pieces of a puzzle, once you&#039;ve figured out how one piece fits with another and another piece fits with that, you&#039;re on your way to making a bigass puzzle.

If on the other hand, if one has doubts not so much about their capability but about their motivation, I believe the best way to maintain motivation when you are lacking comprehension is to seek out media you enjoy as is without the need to understand it. Enjoy some pretty visuals. Watch dubs of movies you already know the dialogue to. Don&#039;t concern yourself with learning if you don&#039;t want to, put your feet up and enjoy the ride.

You might think at some point, &#039;I really should learn more&#039;, but that&#039;s really not necessary to maintain exposure. As long as the language continues to surround you, you will solidify what you&#039;ve learned even if you don&#039;t actively learn any more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I actually like feeling like I suck at Japanese. Well ok, of course I don&#039;t like it, but I find it really helpful. Because when I realize I suck, I&#039;m also reminded that I don&#039;t want to suck anymore, so I go and learn more ;) It all adds up one day. I think the key to learning anything is having the patience to see it through to the end no matter how slow the progress sometimes feels. You can only fail at something if you give up before you win.]]></description>
