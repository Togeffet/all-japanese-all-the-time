					<description><![CDATA[Why Taiwanese books?

These are some reasons that appeal to me.

They are written in Traditional characters which is where I am starting.

They are the only place you can get bopomofo which I find much more accurate in the pronunciation of Mandarin than pin yin. I know both and studied in Taiwan.

There are many more interesting books available because Taiwan unlike China doesn&#039;t censor what it allows to be published.

But.....

If you want to learn simplified characters and don&#039;t really care what you read and...
then go with books from China.

Either way, just stick with it and follow the edicts of our Supreme Leader, the Honorable Lao Ka Tsuh.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Khatz,

I love Infernal Affairs! Seldom have I seen such a good thing on the screen. Do you know if there is any Japanese &quot;comicization&quot; of this trilogy available?

Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

Time to read your Chinese Project from start to most post. I am currently checking out http://www.books.com.tw/ to see if it&#039;s something I could use too. But why Taiwan and not proper China (if the Taiwanese folks forgive me for such a label :-) ). It must be MUCH cheaper there, huh?? I just got the second part of New Practical Chinese Reader from my library, but you can buy that from the publisher and pay an embarrassingly low price (like 30 Yuan/book!).

OK, maybe you&#039;ll get more shopping done in the next parts of these Chinese projects posts. I&#039;m just taking one step at the time.]]></description>
