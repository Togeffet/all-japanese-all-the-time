					<description><![CDATA[Maybe give it a year.  I&#039;m thinking after a year, it&#039;s a good idea to start talking to people in Japanese, however stiff and non-fluent you still are.

					<description><![CDATA[Then loose hope? After doing all that? No other option? You are quite pessimistic...

You could:

   1. Set up the environment and systems that make practice happen consistently and automatically.
AND
   2. Try â€” fail â€” 100,000 times (e.g. SRS reps)
OR
   3. Play for 600,000 minutes (i.e. 36 million seconds).

THEN become so good that no one can ignore you.

IF this is not happening - setup a new environment and systems FOR new adventure.

CONTINUE



P.S.
(And why do you think that we hoped for something? Is it like praying and hoping that something happens? I thought we should DO and ACT .... and play.... ;)  )]]></description>
