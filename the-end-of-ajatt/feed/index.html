					<description><![CDATA[And Daniel, etc.- Khatz p[robably could start a cult of language learners. He might have already done so, inadvertently. There are always some people looking for The Truth. This site doesn&#039;t feature The Truth (I disagree with Khatz on a lot of things, and I think I am right about at least some of them) but it does provide a healthy dose of the truth in an area where there is a lot of bull**** being slung. Some people get overly excited and mistake that for The Truth. That&#039;s pretty predictable, and not really Khatz&#039;s fault. His penchant for self-promotion may encourage that as a second-order effect, but hell, who can blame him for a bit of self-promotion in the age of the attention economy?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm- reminds me of seeing this recently: http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/01/20/learning-language/. At least his &quot;How to learn any language in 3 months&quot; is an upgrade from an earlier post that was more like &quot;learn any language in a week.&quot; Actually, he has some things figured out- he apparently learned a lot of Japanese from reading a book on Judo, and he is aware that classes don&#039;t really work.

I&#039;ve been learning languages in a manner similar to the khatzumomo system for years, and when I try to explain it to people they always say something like &quot;There&#039;s no way something that easy could work.&quot; And I don&#039;t understand how they could misunderstand me so badly- it&#039;s not easier than classes, it&#039;s harder. But it&#039;s not as boring and it works better ;). That&#039;s the difference between this sort of &quot;system&quot; (I find it kind of weird to call something people have been doing for thousands of years, naturally, a &quot;system&quot;, but...) and the &quot;learn any language in a week&quot; programs.]]></description>
