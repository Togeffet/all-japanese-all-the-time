					<description><![CDATA[Maybe I totally missed the point here, but I already feel a bit of that inertia in the Kanji phase. When I&#039;m doing Kanji, I try to think things like, &quot;what else could I possible do right now?&quot; I&#039;ve already told myself that Kanji comes first, and doing anything else now would be a waste of time. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, from one wise platitude to another, you&#039;re just a goldmine of knowledge! Hehe.

&quot;Discipline is remembering what you want.&quot; That&#039;s so true for so much; dieting, studying abstaining from alcohol. I&#039;ve always been a pretty self-disciplined person and I can&#039;t understand what sometimes makes it so difficult for people to stick to a plan, like not drinking cola.

Some of the most successful life coaches - and I know because my mum loves life coaching and all that - really focus on positive visualisation. In &#039;positive visualisation&#039; you take time out of your day to image yourself really slim, or really healthy, or fluent in Japanese as the case may be. By reminding yourself of your goal, you stay on track more easily.

A bit of rant, but I suppose I&#039;m just affirming your wisdom oh mighty one, hehe. (If you haven&#039;t seen already, I&#039;ve a link to you from my now-functioning blog at http://alecinjapan.com/)]]></description>
