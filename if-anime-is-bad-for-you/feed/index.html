					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I do. But I have not tried yet. This: http://captions.pettanko.eu/

If you don&#039;t find the subs you are looking for, try searching in Chinese websites. Why? Because I had found the source of the most kitsunekko subs. But I can&#039;t translate properly chinese to really find the subs I&#039;m looking for. By now, these two options are the best I had found. Since this topic is about anime, I am reluctant to also recommend this website for Japanese Drama subs... anyway:

http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/

Enjoy, people!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lol this doesn&#039;t have much to do with Anime, but I&#039;ve gotten sooooo used to saying 俺 and I barely talk with ですます, when I went to Japan for a 10 day trip a month ago, we got on a bus and an immigration lady got on asking for identification of everybody. My dad was holding my passport but I decided to sit far away. So the lady comes to me and the next thing I know, I&#039;m literally saying 「い、今お父さんが持ってるんッスよ、俺のパスポートを。ほら、其処に座ってる」

She was like 「分かりました」 and right after I wanted to crawl in a hole and never come out because I realized how impolite I sounded to this pretty lady.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Besides, regardless of wether it&#039;s &#039;correct&#039; Japanese or not, it is extremely relevant. Any massively popular anime will be talked about and quoted a lot. One could say one shouldn&#039;t play World of Warcraft because of all the genre-specific terms, but I have come across a ridiculous amount of Chinese words whose origin can be traced to WoW. Words like PK are used all the time in China.

Saying you shouldn&#039;t learn from anime because it isn&#039;t &#039;real&#039; Japanese is like saying you shouldn&#039;t learn Andy Lau&#039;s Chinese name because, like, who&#039;s called that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, there&#039;s a nonsense surrounding &quot;anime Japanese&quot;. I once read someone compare the Japanese found in anime to &quot;ebonics&quot;. At first I kind of believed that, but now (after my Japanese has improved) I don&#039;t have a clue of what these people are talking about. It seems to be normal Japanese to me. As you get better you start to notice more things, like how the characters revert to polite Japanese when talking to their superiors, for example.

Contrary to popular beliefs, I&#039;m not going to go around using &quot;貴様&quot; as a standard word for you, or say &quot;おい、おめえ駅どこ”when asking a Japanese person for directions. 

It&#039;s funny that when I tune into a Japanese podcast, or open up a Japanese web page, the same words and phrases that I learn from anime appear.

These same people then recommend that you study exclusively from textbooks and classrooms. 

Anything that gets the language in you is good for you (by natives for natives).]]></description>
