					<description><![CDATA[Hey

The 10,000 hour business. As far as Japanese, Mandarin, Arabic and Korean are concerned 10,000 hours looks about right.

The FSI students need around 4000 hours to reach level 3 (self-study hours included). Levels 4 and 5 are uncharted territory - no course will take you that far and from what I was able to read about it, these levels require exponentially more study time. It is possible to conclude and guesstimate from this information that in order to reach level 4+ (native-like) most students will indeed need around 10,000 study hours.]]></description>

&quot;I have noticed from time to time that the romanization method first used tends to influence one&#039;s accent in Chinese. It seems to me a Chinese person with a very keen ear could distinguish Americans speaking, say, Wade-Giles-accented Chinese from pinyin-accented Chinese.&quot;

That&#039;s exactly what my guitar teacher told me...

Whenever people menton that I&#039;m &quot;really good&quot; at Japanese... I just point out that I&#039;ve been at it since high school and lived there for six years. Seriously. It&#039;s not that I&#039;m smart. It&#039;s just that I&#039;ve been doing it foreeeeeever.

Argh. Now I just gotta motivate myself to do more of other stuff I need to get good at!

I gotta get that book.]]></description>
