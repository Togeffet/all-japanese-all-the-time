					<description><![CDATA[This is one of my favourite AJATT articles, and it seemed only fitting to post my new findings here.

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been going through a full blown &quot;Are we there yet&quot; phase, but I have been thinking more about the future than the present lately. Either way, what I realized was that thinking, &quot;I&#039;m at x stage of the journey&quot; is forever placing where I *should* be in the future, and leaves me in a state of uncompleted-ness. 

What I&#039;ve found is, the better way to reflect on the situation is simply thinking, &quot;being able to understand and comprehend x amount; it&#039;s my current way of life.&quot; This more present-centric way of thinking seems like a more uplifting way to think about things for me. After all, we don&#039;t go around saying. &quot;yeah, I&#039;m at x stage of life&quot; - we generally just think in the now.

I don&#039;t know, this is probably a twist on something that&#039;s already been covered, but I thought I&#039;d put it out there in case it helped anyone.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Khatzumoto for spreading the positive vibe.
I think that people who have any kind of higher formal education tend to over dramatize language learning process. They would like to cram a grammar , memorize 5000 words and that&#039;s it. Now let&#039;s speak!!! Wait, no, something is not working, ok I MUST learn another 5000 words and revise the grammar, that is like 50 words per day , another 3 months!!! I suck, I am going to kill my self. 

In reality, language learning is more process than a chore with the beginning and the end. Also , some people don&#039;t get that one can rarely go to job, study for school, phd or whatever, go to gym , hang out, make a business and travel at the same time! You must be focused in a funny way. Like AJATT, you still have a life and you are enjoying it but you are making progress, far better progress compared to &quot;serious learning&quot; process where you look like a retard , always feel under the pressure and compare with others. 

To conclude , keep learning and it is not possible to stay on the same level.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must have read this before, but it&#039;s great reading it again.

I&#039;m at exactly this stage in Dutch right now, and having those same thoughts like &quot;alright already, when am I going to stop sucking?&quot;. The thing is, I already have my own evidence because I taught myself fluent German using something &quot;AJATT-like&quot;, and German is reeeally close to Dutch. 

So why does my brain insist on telling me that I suck at Dutch and I&#039;m never going to get there, when I&#039;ve already proven that it works in nearly identical circumstances? I guess that&#039;s just the power of your perception during the intermediate stage that you&#039;re not really going that fast, even if you are. Fly a hundred flights, and the take-off will still seem more exciting than the middle.

I guess this also holds some advice for those new to language acquisition: even the &quot;experienced&quot; people feel this way when they&#039;re partway through a language. Focus on the fun instead of the result, and it&#039;ll work itself out.]]></description>
