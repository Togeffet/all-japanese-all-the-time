					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure this was due to him learning hanzi for both Chinese and Japanese intially, and considering Chinese, 4500 is not unreasonable.

Probably this is also why/how he used all the pre-US occupation kanji as well.

I&#039;m at around 4100 characters myself, though I am doing Mandarin and not Japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You were able to write 4500 kanji from memory? Dang man... I want, nay, =need= this skill! I think I need a bit more time for this one. ^^ I&#039;m happy to say though that after a year of AJATTing I&#039;ve achieved a lot of similar things on that list. The other day I was chatting with someone and she didn&#039;t give me any of the usual &#039;wow you&#039;re Japanese is so good&#039;, which was interesting. Then a way into the conversation she asked how long I had been in the country. 
&quot;I just got here earlier this month&quot;.
&quot;Whaaaaaaa?&quot; (paraphrasing)
&quot;THIS IS SPARTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&quot; (I didn&#039;t say it but I was thinking it. I&#039;ve been wanting to ever since I read that grammar does not exist post.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heya Khatzumoto!

I was just wondering how good you would say your Japanese is now. I&#039;m not Japanese so I have no way of assessing it, but after taking a look at Michal Ryszard Wojcik&#039;s site, Norsk Experiment, I became kind of disheartened. He has apparently studied English using this Natural Method, yet the English he has written on his site is far from perfect, with some sentences being completely ungrammatical. How close would you say you are to a native speaker? How has your language intuition developed? Would you say you can feel Japanese like you can feel English? (And thus correct sentences and change them around to make them sound better etc.)

I&#039;d be really interested in hearing about this!

Many thanks! Luke!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I listen to mp3 while sleeping. It has helped with my sleeping habits actually because I end up waking up after 7 hours consistently. If only I got off my bed. Anyways, as someone has said before me, I also have more dreams in Japanese. A couple of days ago, I actually heard/or said I sentence in Japanese while dreaming. During the dream/or as soon as gaining consciousness, I thought &#039;Hey, I&#039;ve never learned that sentence in my life (consciously)&#039;. When I woke up, I wanted to check the dictionary for that word in my dream, which I&#039;ve never heard of. But I couldn&#039;t remember it. It would have been nice if I could have verified whether I just made up the word, or I actually heard it somewhere.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If REM stages are the most beneficial, I think it&#039;s better hearing after four and a half hours of sleep. If you wake up and connect your mp3 device, you&#039;ll make the most of your REM stages, because they are longer as the night advances.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found that when I listen while sleeping that I dream more in Japanese and sometimes the podcasts that I&#039;ve listened to many times will even become incorporated in my dreams and shape them. It&#039;s kind of weird and cool. It&#039;s probably correct that in the deeper stages of sleep nothing may be getting through, but I do believe that during the REM stages in does have a beneficial effect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@quendidil (May 15, 2008 @ 6:49 pm);
A while ago I read an article about sleep learning. The conclusion: it doesn&#039;t work because your brain &#039;shuts down&#039; from everything outside. I know that Khatz promotes it, but so far I know he only promotes it because something gets in just before you fall asleep and just before you wake up. But I guess if this 30 minutes are worth running you pc or radio all night long.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[about what to  listening in your mp3 device:

When I started to learn chinese, I friend of mine who was in my classes too, advised me to listening Pmsleur sets, in fact his chinese was better than anothers classmates I included.
Was to boring need to listening ALL PAUSED ALL THE TIME sets, a lot of english, and them I tried to CLS pod, what a suck! The chinese guys ( a girls who probably apears to be very cute and another guy) trying to show us their english proficience, a Ni HAO lesson pay for 99% in english for exemple, in fact to boring too.

All chinese courses is VERY boring to listening or pay attetion that, I then deleted all kind of chinese courses from my HD.

When a suddenly stoped by  in AJATT, to freedon my self about what in fact I have some feeling but dont has courage to accept.

Okay, when you are a beginner(without self confidence to accept WHAT YOU WANT) you can do some classes, listening to cousers sets etc etc. But, try another level and TRASH THEN as soon as possible!

BTW:

I keep on studying with a teacher (who is in fact very funny) a old citzen part russian part chinese. Just for fun! Just to test me! Just to know was china 50-60 years ago! Just to contact with anothers real chinese speakers! And the main: just to force me to become fluently as quickle possible and save my chineses classes money!]]></description>

spends a lot of money to travel in &quot;fulltime&quot; courses stay about 3-4 month there and comeback to brazil in a same lavel when he or she went abroad.

It is possible create a artificial(when you stay on yours country) or natural(when you travel abroad) enviroment. 

And despict the fact you travel or not a semi-natural enviroment is possible to building in yours origin country.

Khatzumoto show it for all of us, he was able to get the learning process change.

The listening process is in fact the most important( and pehaps easier to do, for sure)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Christina:
I&#039;m not Khatz, but I&#039;ll try to answer this.
Basically:
1.Get an MP3 player and put in podcasts, music, audiobooks, newscasts etc. 
2.Get a set of headphones.
3.Listen.

The hardest part for me to implement is sleeping with headphones on. I can fall asleep all right, but my headphones will get screwed up or something over the course of the night. I tried leaving my desktop on playing low volumes of ripped anime dialogue but am worried about environmental friendliness and the electrical consumption.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is pretty off-topic, but I thought I&#039;d ask.

You have several posts on listening, but mainly they are focused on why and when. Do you think you could do something on what and how? I know it seems like common sense, but myself and some other language-learners I know are just having trouble with the listening thing. Thank you!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love if the &quot;resting the eyes&quot; method worked but I just can&#039;t do it(YET). When I start reading a manga of Naruto, 2 hours get spent so easily like if it were only 10 minutes. But that&#039;s ok. I&#039;m gonna work on this (‰ªïÊñπ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„Å≠ :) ).]]></description>
