					<description><![CDATA[This demonstrates the problem with learning grammar right here. You&#039;ve stated that a majority of native English speakers would say &quot;if you would have said&quot;, and they don&#039;t even know it&#039;s wrong. Who said it&#039;s wrong? If the majority of native speakers don&#039;t think it&#039;s wrong, whose business is it to tell them that it is? Nobody&#039;s business, that&#039;s whose. It is not, in fact, wrong to say &quot;if you would have said&quot;, nor is it wrong to say &quot;I wanna lay down&quot;. This is how native English speakers speak, and it is native English speakers that determine what is correct English, not whatever grammar guide you read that told you those sentences are wrong. The purpose of grammar is to describe the rules of how a language is used. If a grammar guide disagrees with how the majority of speakers use the language, then it is the grammar guide that is wrong, not the other way around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Grammar is like my best friend! Even if it sounds right to say &quot;I&#039;m better than her.&quot; I just have to say &quot;I&#039;m better than she.&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m better than she is.&quot;  Don&#039;t bully him/her! ;-;

‚Äúhere is the overall, abstract set of meta-rules, memorize it, and then use it to crank stuff out‚Äù

Hahaha, that&#039;s so true but I love it anyway. I was actually pretty surprised when I learned the past tense for verbs... it was so... easy. Before whenever I heard about it, it was described as being like the most complex thing on the planet. At the same time, memorizing sentences just kills me. @_@ For me, learning by sentence is just a way to enforce grammar. I guess the learning method just depends on how you learn, and most people don&#039;t think about grammar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that grammar is often a hindrance.  I know it from personal experience; when I play the &quot;put together a Japanese sentence game&quot; I take forever to say anything and when I finally do, it comes out unnatural and awkward.

However, how are you supposed to learn some things without some kind of explanation?  For example, things like &quot;„Çì„Åß„Åô&quot;„ÄÄor &quot;„Å£„Å¶&quot;?

					<description><![CDATA[Hey James!

Congratulations on finishing Heisig, that&#039;s an outstanding achievement!
Thanks for your comment (and for the sweet method name).
Yeah, I&#039;m pretty anti-textbook (http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-use-a-japanese-textbook), and the folk at AntiMoon are absolutely right: textbooks are often so sanitized that they give you an awkward, unnatural version of a language that&#039;s light years away from the real thing. If you&#039;ve ever seen a textbook for English learners then you&#039;ll know what I mean. It&#039;s like, yeah, it&#039;s English, but who on earth says &quot;how do you do?&quot;.

Having said that, your textbook is
1) All in Japanese, and
2) Has sentences
If, on top of that, it is
3) Fun
Then there&#039;s no need to summarily throw it away. You can certainly mine it for sentences. BUT if it ever bores you, then don&#039;t feel like you have to &quot;plough through&quot; it. Japanese was meant to be fun; you&#039;re sacrificing enough every time you choose something Japanese over something in English, you need not sacrifice joy as well.

There are two really cool quotes attributed to Bruce Lee; I don&#039;t know for sure whether he actually said them or not, but they have some value and bear repeating:

&gt;&gt; &quot;Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction...&quot;
&gt;&gt; &quot;Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.&quot;
We probably don&#039;t want to deny textbooks for the sake of denying them. But if they suck, then it&#039;s best to be rid of them.

Anyway, congratulations on doing all your stuff in Japanese! That&#039;s wonderful. You&#039;re obviously so good and so persistent already that fluency is just a foregone conclusion :).]]></description>

<p>Congratulations on finishing Heisig, that&#8217;s an outstanding achievement!<br />
Thanks for your comment (and for the sweet method name).<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m pretty anti-textbook (http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-use-a-japanese-textbook), and the folk at AntiMoon are absolutely right: textbooks are often so sanitized that they give you an awkward, unnatural version of a language that&#8217;s light years away from the real thing. If you&#8217;ve ever seen a textbook for English learners then you&#8217;ll know what I mean. It&#8217;s like, yeah, it&#8217;s English, but who on earth says &#8220;how do you do?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having said that, your textbook is<br />
1) All in Japanese, and<br />
2) Has sentences<br />
If, on top of that, it is<br />
3) Fun<br />
Then there&#8217;s no need to summarily throw it away. You can certainly mine it for sentences. BUT if it ever bores you, then don&#8217;t feel like you have to &#8220;plough through&#8221; it. Japanese was meant to be fun; you&#8217;re sacrificing enough every time you choose something Japanese over something in English, you need not sacrifice joy as well.</p>
<p>There are two really cool quotes attributed to Bruce Lee; I don&#8217;t know for sure whether he actually said them or not, but they have some value and bear repeating:</p>
<p>>> &#8220;Do not deny the classical approach, simply as a reaction&#8230;&#8221;<br />
>> &#8220;Use only that which works, and take it from any place you can find it.&#8221;<br />
We probably don&#8217;t want to deny textbooks for the sake of denying them. But if they suck, then it&#8217;s best to be rid of them.</p>
<p>Anyway, congratulations on doing all your stuff in Japanese! That&#8217;s wonderful. You&#8217;re obviously so good and so persistent already that fluency is just a foregone conclusion :).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello khatzumoto,

I have started following your method or the ÊñáÁ´†ÊñπÊ≥ï as I am calling it. However I am already an intermediate learner and I finished Heisig Book 1 over a year ago and so I have moved straight on to learning sentences wothout translation. Even in just two weeks of using the sentence method my progress has increased rapidly. I honestly believe thinking in Japanese is getting closer and closer. I read on the antimoon page that using a textbook is not recommended. The textbook I currrently use is „Éã„É•„Éº„Ç¢„Éó„É≠„Éº„ÉÅ‰∏≠‰∏äÁ¥öÊó•Êú¨Ë™û (entirely written in Japanese). I am wondering if I should give it up and just concentrate on the sentence method? 

what would your advice be?
