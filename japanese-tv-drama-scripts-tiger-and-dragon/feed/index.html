					<description><![CDATA[http://project-modelino.com/movie-review.php?site_language=english&#038;learn_language=japanese&#038;movie=195
I thought someone posted this but now I not so sure if anyone did... So here it is... Enjoy ^_^
P.S. I use KM player and use the right subtitle button (increase subtitle delay to 17000ms after a certain area during the show to sync) Also for some unknown reason I cannot find out why the even number shows don&#039;t show the subs.. O_O But the subs are still there none the less...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First: thank you khatzumoto. You&#039;re my hero. :-)
Second: For all of us who enjoyed the &quot;お前の母ちゃん” line:
I&#039;m not sure if someone already posted the link, but here&#039;s the link for the subtitles for Tiger and Dragon: 
http://www.d-addicts.com/forum/viewtopic_90451.htm
Depending on your version of the movie files, your subtitles might need editing (for timing), but you can put in a &quot;delay&quot; command (positive or negative delay) in the subtitle files (you can find the instructions in the files themselves, at the top). For linux, try: smplayer. It handles subtitles very well. In smplayer, you can fine tune the subtitle timing as well. Enjoy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Someone above asked where one can find anime scripts, so here&#039;s a link:
http://neoending.web.fc2.com/

This site contains transcriptions for the first and last episodes of several anime, game, and special effects live action titles. Scripts from these kinds of shows don&#039;t exactly have the most realistic or challenging material, but perhaps there are still many expressions found in everyday situations which can be picked up from these scripts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[updated link for T&#038;D http://www.dramanote.com/?cid=32474 The site is a bit overwhelming at first, mainly because of all the ads, you eyes don&#039;t know what they&#039;re looking for. The link has the episodes from recent to oldest. i.e. the first episode you see is the last episode. Once you find it, it&#039;s just pure text--no download link or anything.

Has anyone turned these into subs or know where to find Japanese subs for this show?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent website!
I&#039;m using so much of what you wrote.
I tried to find the actual complete dialogue/transcript for Trick, either on dramanote or on amazon japan.. Of course, I can read only about 1200 kanji yet. I still have about three weeks of work to do with remembering the kanji... but with shipping times and all, I&#039;d like to be ready and have all my material for when I&#039;m done.. Do you know where I could find it?
Also,.. I know of one bittorrent site for japanese media: tokyo toshokan (http://www.tokyotosho.com/index.php), but I haven&#039;t found more yet (that have any significant amount of real japanese stuff). Do you know any? Living in Canada, here you can&#039;t really find much in videostores...

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;ve just got Tiger and Dragon from Amazon.co.jp, and I am looking forward to watching it...

Right now though I&#039;m enjoying the Fuji TV series &#039;Security Police&#039; (available at d-addicts). The dialogue is available at dramanote.com ( http://www.dramanote.com/?cid=27078 ). If anyone hasn&#039;t been following this, I recommend it - it&#039;s great fun :-)


BTW - when you&#039;ve got a moment Khatz, could you just give a *general* comment on the accuracy of the Japanese at dramanote - I assume it&#039;s all good stuff, but I&#039;d hate to enter hundreds of sentences from dramanote only to later discover that all the scripts there are typed by dsylexic 5 year olds.

I don&#039;t really care whether the dialogue on dramanote is absolutely accurate with regard to having every single line of dialogue from a drama --  I just want to know that I can enter it into my SRS with confidence that the Japanese itself is good and doesn&#039;t contain grammar/vocab errors.

Thanks!]]></description>

<p>Right now though I&#8217;m enjoying the Fuji TV series &#8216;Security Police&#8217; (available at d-addicts). The dialogue is available at <a href="http://dramanote.com" class="autohyperlink">dramanote.com</a> ( <a href="http://www.dramanote.com/?cid=27078" class="autohyperlink">www.dramanote.com/?cid=27078</a> ). If anyone hasn&#8217;t been following this, I recommend it &#8211; it&#8217;s great fun 🙂</p>
<p>BTW &#8211; when you&#8217;ve got a moment Khatz, could you just give a *general* comment on the accuracy of the Japanese at dramanote &#8211; I assume it&#8217;s all good stuff, but I&#8217;d hate to enter hundreds of sentences from dramanote only to later discover that all the scripts there are typed by dsylexic 5 year olds.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really care whether the dialogue on dramanote is absolutely accurate with regard to having every single line of dialogue from a drama &#8212;  I just want to know that I can enter it into my SRS with confidence that the Japanese itself is good and doesn&#8217;t contain grammar/vocab errors.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been going through the Tiger and Dragon scripts on Drama Note. It seems to me that much of the dialogue from the show had been left out, and/or converted into narration form instead. Could you please &lt;a href=&quot;http://dramanote.seesaa.net/article/2985495.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;confirm this for me with the Shibahama episode&lt;/a&gt;, Khatzumoto? (Because if this is true, it would mean that I can&#039;t rely fully on the website.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LoL! I don&#039;t really know any yakuza personally, Wan-san! :). But...the way Ginjiro&#039;s dad talks is far closer to REAL kansai-ben than the dumbed-down-for-Tokyo-people &quot;何でやねん&quot; version you usually see on TV. 

Ginjiro talks more or less like a ヤンキー.
Ginjiro&#039;s dad talks like a lot of men do in every country in the world -- mumbled and slack-jawed; regardless of country, it always seems to be women that are the ones who speak clearly.]]></description>
