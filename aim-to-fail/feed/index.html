					<description><![CDATA[This is probabily the second life-changing post that I read on your blog, right now it&#039;s 5 a.m, so I keep it short. In the beginning of 2012 i started a turning course and i sucked, besides getting good grades on the tests, I was the worst student in the practices, they quickly labeled me as the &quot;nerd guy who isn&#039;t good at practical stuff&quot; and putt me on the side, I sucked so hard, never finishing a part without several errors and in the time they set for us, back then I had a very anxious mentality and always feel bad about my situation, I mean, VERY bad, I guess I was depressive. Wasn&#039;t hard for me to realize that the teachers didn&#039;t care to me and the other bad students at all, they just start a new class, focus on the ones who got high grades and did everything right from the start and forget the rest, and that&#039;s how practically every single industrial related job works. I was basically operating machines and tools so failing was very time, effort and (mainly) emotional expensive. In the end of 2012 I was reading your post 
&quot;Ask Dr. Khatz: Sidetracked in Salt Lake&quot; and it totally hit me, I first started learning japanese with RTK in the end of 2011 but quit due to the course, I tried several times with some progress but quickly gave up and started doing other things. But after reading this post a finally saw the truth that was right in front of me all that time, I wasn&#039;t doing a real immersion!, I read all your posts, said to myself &quot;oh that dude is badass&quot; but never tried any of your ideas, after that first life-changing moment got directly to my PC and started to delete EVERY stuff that wasn&#039;t in japanese, Fallout, TF2, call of duty, a lot o movies, comics, games etc.. and then went through youtube and unsubscribe every single channel that wasn&#039;t in japanese, and then change my OS to japanese, while deleting all that stuff I saw all my old life passing thorough my eyes, all the pointless discutions on comments, all the useless time spend with gameplay videos and vlogs, that was a amazing liberating experience. But then a remember of a phrase &quot;habits can&#039;t be changed, they just can be replaced&quot; so I rush to download as much animes, mangas, and subscribe to japanese channels and bookmark japanese sites as I could, cuz I knew I if just delete everything and sit looking at my empty desktop I would just come back to my old life, and it worked, I suddenly feel much more motivated to to my kanji reps, finished RTK and started learning every single word that a came across in the first 3 days and then started to learning bunchs of 60 words from several sources, always changing every time I saw something more interesting (before that I always did the classical mistake to choose a textbook/manga and said to myself that I would got thorough it and learning every new word on it, which feels cool in the beginning but once I become bored I started to force myself to went to it to learn words &quot;because it&#039;s good to me&quot; and end up quitting all the process once the boringness become stronger than my limited willpower).
 Backing to the main topic, now I intend to quit my current &quot;career&quot; and start learning computer programming, cuz I can apply the same principles that I learned from japanese and start failing in free, no-emotional and low-effort way]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently in an excange program abroad and have thus been thrust whole heartedly into a whole world of new languages. This concept of failure is spot on for learning the language over time as well as just adjusting in general to a world of complete difference. The only problem I&#039;m having is in concerns with the AntiMoon concept of input correctly before writing and talking. In an Exchange situation I HAVE to have output every day while still a beginner(or two months this week) of the language! I&#039;m very at odds about this concept as I want to be as perfect as possible at the language, but also want to learn as much as possible. I have already had quite a few instances of learning something and outputting it to find later that it is wrong. Are there any tips or ideas as far as learning for this type of immersion and learning of the language?]]></description>
