					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] My weakness is playing games that have easy, quick accomplishments. That&#8217;s probably why Read the Kanji worked so well for me. I could do a few reps and not notice. It&#8217;s also why Super Smash Bros. works so well. The longest mode in the game (probably All Star Mode) only takes 5-10 minutes in total. Every morning it&#8217;s possible to see some Japanese without even trying. In the words of Khatzumoto, &#8220;Make things too small to resist&#8220;. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting this. You&#039;ve always written about taking things in our own rhythm, but somehow I never applied that to my life. When I was doing my schedule, it was always something like: &#039;&#039;2 hours of this&#039;&#039; plus &#039;&#039;2 hours of that&#039;&#039;. In the end, I feel overwhelmed just by looking at the schedule and knowing I have to do a task for 2 hours; by the end of the day, I did almost nothing at all.

 Yesterday I read this post, and decided not to demand so much of myself. So instead of writing &#039;&#039;2 hours&#039;&#039;, I wrote &#039;&#039;15 minutes&#039;&#039; for each task. When I was doing my reps, I looked up to see the time and 3 hours had passed! I started the task, knowing it was easy to do, and then I got so much into it, that time just went by without me noticing it. ^_^ Thank you so much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post couldn&#039;t have come at a better time. 

A few days ago, I started noticing that I was dreading doing kanji. Even though I&#039;m only doing 15-20 per day, it felt like a lot to do them all (along with 40-60 reps of old kanji) all in one go. I decided to try breaking it down into chunks of 5-10 kanji at a time... at first I didn&#039;t even want to bother because, well, &quot;5 kanji is nothing.&quot;

Of course, that nothingness is what makes it feasible. Case in point: today I&#039;ve learned 40 new kanji and have already gone through 50 reps, and will probably do 20-30 more reps later on. 

&#039;Sides, breaking stuff into tiny chunks makes it easier to fit into your schedule, no matter what your schedule looks like. Not everyone can afford to sit down and study for an hour straight, but most people can afford to sit down and study for 5-15mins at a time, a few times per day.]]></description>
