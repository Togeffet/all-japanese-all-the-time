								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I was doing some immersion multiplexing, and this song come up in the background behind the Cantonese podcast I was foregrounding (it&#8217;s a very weird podcast, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it unless you like weird things):</p>
<ul>
<li>[(34) gotta get thru this (acoustic) &#8211; daniel bedingfield &#8211; YouTube] <a href="https://goo.gl/DiQHLy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">goo.gl/DiQHLy</a></li>
<li>[Gotta Get Thru This (song) &#8211; Wikipedia] <a href="https://goo.gl/hzAcAK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">goo.gl/hzAcAK</a></li>
<li>[(34) 2013-01-07„ÄäÊ∑±ÈùàÂ∞çË©±„Äã- Ê∑∫Ë´áÈáèÂ≠êÂäõÂ≠∏ËàáÊñ∞ÊôÇ‰ª£Ê¶ÇÂøµ &#8211; YouTube] <a href="https://goo.gl/7BcqkQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">goo.gl/7BcqkQ</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, so, Daniel Bedingfield. &#8220;Tune!&#8221;. Right? Right? Yeah. Great song. I even had a twinge of nostalgia as I remember being in my uni flat, my college apartment, if you will, with my friends Stacey G. and Jennifer B., introducing them to that UK garage sound.</p>
<p>And then I remembered. This song. That time of my life&#8230;was, in many ways, not awesome at all. My life at that time was a pressure cooker, assignment to assignment, crisis to crisis. And this song, &#8220;I gotta get thru this&#8221;, rather succinctly encapsulates a sizable proportion of my daily mindset.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is a bag of empty lies. And so is despair. And regret? Don&#8217;t even get me started; you&#8217;d be better off licking the floor of a dive bar than believing that pile of crap &#8212; no, really &#8212; neither activity is good but the former is less damaging to your happiness, health and wealth.</p>
<p><strong>There is no time that your life was all gilded perfection. Nor is there ever a time when your life was unadulterated suck. It&#8217;s all mixed up. </strong><em>Sic semper erat, et sic semper erit</em>: thus has it always been, and thus shall it ever be.</p>
<p>Like, I loved my childhood: it was filled with laughter, friendships, fun, toys, games, horses, puppies and sublime moments of beauty and wonderment &#8212; <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/did-your-childhood-mess-you-up/">and also utter trucking bullshizzle. Pain, humiliation, dirt, fear, failure, crowding, isolation. I would never go back to boyhood, not even for a day</a>. And college life? There are things I wished and hoped and prayed for in vain back then that I can now make happen <em>instantly</em>.</p>
<p>By the way, &#8220;Back to Boyhood&#8221;&#8230;sounds like a pretty boss second album title for my non-existent indie emo soundcloud fusion hiphop band, Supernova Cheesecake.</p>
<p>Anyway!</p>
<p><strong>Your life is always a mix of danger and opportunity, crises and ease, solved problems you&#8217;re no longer even aware of (let alone grateful for) and new problems you mistakenly think have occurred because you&#8217;re a bad person.</strong></p>
<p>Problems have nothing to do with morality. (Un?)fortunately, life doesn&#8217;t work like a fairy tale. There is no meaning; there is no conclusion; there is no destiny except whatever you ascribe, accept or believe in. Bad people aren&#8217;t ugly; good people aren&#8217;t indigent; pretty people aren&#8217;t bad; indigent people aren&#8217;t villains; ugly people aren&#8217;t mean. This isn&#8217;t an ontological or epistemological conjecture; it&#8217;s just a plain statement of fact.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is, there is literally no convenient sorting. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/there-is-no-narrative/"><strong>There is no narrative</strong></a>. We sometimes wish there were, and (in moments of psychological immaturity) we occasionally fear there might be, but there ain&#8217;t any. It&#8217;s not there. It&#8217;s all mixed up. Everything is mixed up. But you get to sort it out, and you get to improve.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not having problems because you are or were bad or dumb or unlucky or untalented or wasteful; that&#8217;s fairy tale logic and you are no toddler; <strong>you&#8217;re having problems because that&#8217;s what people who are alive have</strong>. They&#8217;re just fun little sprint missions for you to do, little challenges. You solve, you unlock the badge, then new ones come up. Just a little something for you play at. A puzzle. A brain teaser. A bone to gnaw at.</p>
<p>And it may seem like your challenges suck balls and everybody else has easier ones. But, as that saying goes, if we all put all of our problems in a bag and got to trade them wholesale (full set, no mix-and-matchsies) with other people, you would ask for <em>all</em> of yours back.</p>
<p>You have just the right problems you need to chew on, to grow with, to enjoy. You really do. What about people who have no Internet and no electricity? Well, they&#8217;re not reading this, so chill. This is about you.</p>
<p>Play an old song, and think back to what you were worried about 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago. It makes you laugh, it&#8217;s so trivial. Realize that, 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now, you&#8217;ll be saying the same thing. This is why grandparents are so chill. They knew. They know. ¬†<strong>Your crisis, whatever it is, is like a jump-scare in a horror movie: it&#8217;s meant to entertain you, not terrify you, build you, not destroy you. Scare you for laughs, not scar you for life</strong>. <strong>For play, not for punishment. </strong>Yeah, even this current one that looks all big and bad. They&#8217;re all like that. Sometimes we&#8217;re a little slow on the uptake, and it takes us a while to get the joke. But the sooner we do, the better. We don&#8217;t have to be slow forever. We can all become quick studies.</p>
<p>Enjoy yourself. Enjoy your immersion. Enjoy your SRS. Remember the one true secret to happiness, productivity and sanity: <strong>live fully, completely and totally in the moment. </strong>Life isn&#8217;t a movie or a novel; you&#8217;re not a character; there is no narrative thread, just an infinite matrix of infinite options and possibilities. Drink it all in.<strong> It&#8217;s all part of the non-story that isn&#8217;t happening. Same game, new skin.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I was about 9 years old, Rome has consistently stood as one of my favorite ancient civilizations. Oh, who am I kidding, it <em>is</em> my favorite; I&#8217;m acting like one of those guys who watches <em>Star Wars</em> and¬†<em>Star Trek</em> all the time but claims not be into it. <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A1%AF%E7%A4%BA%E6%80%A7%E5%81%8F%E5%A5%BD">My library cannot lie</a>: I love me some Rome.</p>
<p>The Romans were a very interesting bunch of people. As a group, they (obviously) did a lot wrong, but they also got a lot right. In particular, I love their practicality, their relative egalitarianism (by ancient standards), with an expansive definition of group membership that influences us to this day, to say nothing of the social mobility that characterized their society. So, in a word, meritocracy <a class="simple-footnote" title="I mean, arguably, meritocracy is a manifestation of practicality, but, whatever :D" id="return-note-37683-1" href="#note-37683-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, is one of the things really I love about the ancient Romans. Too bad they never figured out the succession-of-power thing. That would have been good for them (and no doubt the rest of the world &#8212; the Christian Dark Ages were not good for human progress). Also, the lead pipes thing. In a way, it&#8217;s a testament to their awesomeness that even in their errors, they have much to teach us. Right or wrong, Rome is full of ressons.</p>
<p>Sorry, lessons <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</p>
<p>So, as an out-of-the-closet Romanophile (is that word? we&#8217;re making it one), you can imagine my delight when, while <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/?s=multiplexing">doing</a> some <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/how-to-do-immersion-multiplexing-using-an-android-device-tabletsmartphone/">immersion</a> <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/more-immersion-multiplexing-hardware-two-devices-two-pairs-of-headphones-4-5-audio-streams/">multiplexing</a>, I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrzbMq2arVA#t=5m30s">this talk by an ancient historian named Richard Carrier, entitled &#8220;What Did the Romans Do For Us, Part 2&#8221;.</a></p>
<p>The money shot is when he talks about the three core scientific values that the Greco-Roman scientific worldview bequeathed to posterity:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Curiosity is a moral good</li>
<li>Empiricism is the primary mode of discovery &#8212; <strong>evidence trumps authority</strong>; it doesn&#8217;t matter what your rank is or whatever; evidence ends any argument.</li>
<li>Progress is both possible and valuable &#8212; you¬†<em>can</em> learn more</li>
</ol>
<p><em>[<a href="https://goo.gl/zvmxBH">Richard Carrier &#8211; What did the Romans Do For US &#8211; Part 2 &#8211; YouTube</a>] </em></p></blockquote>
<p>And I really cannot think of three better values for a language get-used-to-er (because you don&#8217;t learn a language, you get used to it) than these. Frankly, they&#8217;re way better than <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-three-laws-of-language-learning-version-3-0/">the three laws of language acquisition</a>. Hey, I&#8217;m egotistical, but I know a good idea when I see one! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>How can we make these three principles work for us? Easy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curiosity is a moral good. Wanting to know more words is awesome. Get out there and learn what the words mean! Dictionary the fuzz out of them! Find out what they&#8217;re about. You&#8217;re not a loser for not knowing your language yet. You&#8217;re awesome for wanting to know more.</li>
<li>Empiricism is the primary mode of discovery &#8212; evidence trumps any and all authorities: so give school and forums and even me the middle finger. Forge your own path! Find the evidence for a funner, faster way. Better yet, BECOME the evidence yourself!</li>
<li>Progress is both possible and valuable: you <em>can</em> learn Japanese. You will learn Japanese. You will become native-like. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/identity-and-self-fulfilling-prophecy/">You <em>are</em> Japanese</a>. The language belongs to you. It is doable. It is possible. Improvement is a physical reality. If in doubt, go back to principle #1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Too often in modern life, we see science wielded as a tool to shut down possibility. But that&#8217;s literally not what&#8217;s it&#8217;s for; science &#8212; knowledge &#8212; is meant for opening horizons, for creating new possibility, not shutting it down (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8F%8D%E8%A8%BC%E5%8F%AF%E8%83%BD%E6%80%A7">science only shuts down bad possibilities in order to open good ones, not merely for the sake of being snarky</a>). Sorry, bub, but some quote about poorly compiled statistics, further garbled and misunderstood by some journalist writing a clickbaity headline, is not the end of this or any discussion.</p>
<p>Be curious. Be experimental. Be <a href="https://amzn.to/2IuAxZO">kaizen</a>!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;I decide to continue my own study of human behavior in the Mensan game room, which is down the hall in something called the Verrazano Room. Here I find an impressive stack of games: Scrabble, Boggle, Taboo. You name it, they got it. I watch a game where a gray-haired man is trying to get his teammates to guess a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a space between two things,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interstitial!&#8221; shouts a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he says. &#8220;A space between two things.&#8221; &#8220;Interstices!&#8221; she tries again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interstitial! Interstices!&#8221; &#8220;No!&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Time&#8217;s up. The word was &#8220;gap.&#8221; This makes me happy for some reason. This woman is throwing out foursyllable Latinate words, and the answer is the beautifully simple &#8220;gap.&#8221; Some people, I conclude, try way too hard to be smart.&#8221;</p>
[Amazon | The Know-It-All: One Man&#8217;s Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World | A. J. Jacobs | General] <a href="https://amzn.to/2KpeVj5" class="autohyperlink">amzn.to/2KpeVj5</a></p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to this AJATT site. And I&#8217;m <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MATTvsJapan">beginning to agree with Matt</a>: if you want to truly understand it, you need to read it all. You need to digest it all.</p>
<p>At the same time, in all our timeboxing, our <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure/">critical frequency-ing</a>, our <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/more-immersion-multiplexing-hardware-two-devices-two-pairs-of-headphones-4-5-audio-streams/">multiplexing</a>, our <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-is-dead-long-live-mcds/">MCDing</a>, with all these hacks, it&#8217;s easy to<strong> become like an over-sophisticated investor.</strong></p>
<p>What do I mean?</p>
<p>Just this.</p>
<p>One gets lost in so much talk of hedging and spreads and IRAs and tax deferment and margin of safety and supports and resistance and legs and breakouts and earnings per share and return on capital and implied volatility and so much other stuff that we&#8217;re not even going to get into, that<strong> one can forget the simplest, most fundamental truths:</strong></p>
<p>The point of investing is to take out more money than you put in.</p>
<p>The point of budgeting is to spend less than you have (or make more than you spend, take your pick).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s literally it. Everything else is far king decoration. And if you&#8217;re not doing these two things (which are arguably really just one thing), if you&#8217;re not producing a positive balance over time, then it literally doesn&#8217;t matter what you do; you&#8217;re literally better off doing nothing.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BB%E3%83%8B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9B%E3%83%83%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%BC">pull a Niederhoffer</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/10/15/the-blow-up-artist">blow up</a>, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/10/15/the-blow-up-artist">losing all the money you made</a> plus <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/22/blowing-up">all the money you had</a> and <a href="https://www.trendfollowing.com/pdfs/niederhoffer_taleb_gladwell.pdf">then some</a>¬†&#8212; twice! &#8212; then you might as well go and&#8230;I dunno, go try to get aroused by Jenna Jameson (who is very attractive and no doubt a nice person, but never quite hit my sweet spot; she&#8217;s so &#8220;normal-looking&#8221; that I can&#8217;t&#8230;like, for me, the girl has to either be or act weird, like <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC">Ann Coulter</a>, who was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%8A%E5%8F%B3%E7%BF%BC">saying mean things almost two decades before it was cool</a>), because it&#8217;s an equally valid use of your time.</p>
<p>A <strong>child&#8217;s lemonade stand might</strong> literally be more profitable than you, and thus, <strong>dollar for dollar, a better investment of your time and money</strong>, if all your erudition and sophistication doesn&#8217;t lead to profit. Even panhandling might have a better ROI<sub>this isn&#8217;t even conjecture: panhandlers make <em>bank</em>, although many if not most are also drug addicts, so&#8230;it&#8217;s a bit of a wash &#8212; having said that, they&#8217;re playing the game tax-free, using all <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OPM">OPM</a> and no <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp">leverage</a>, so, they still kinda &#8220;win&#8221; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</sub>. These are extreme examples, but no less correct for their extremity.</p>
<p>Now, what does all this speculating and panhandling and lusting after womenfolk have to do with getting used to Japanese, or any other language?</p>
<p>Just this.</p>
<p>In all your cleverness, in all your strategizing, in all your thinking, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/are-you-the-bad-guy-in-a-movie-how/">in all your scheming, in all your Wile E. Coyote-ing</a>, don&#8217;t forget that, when it all comes down to it,¬†at bottom,<strong>¬†<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/cute-girls-mathematics-language/">you still literally just need to come into massive contact with the language</a></strong>. And if you don&#8217;t do that, then all your efforts are for naught.</p>
<p>In other words: don&#8217;t get so clever at investing that you forget to not lose money. This is why online fora (forums? no love for them Latin plurals, eh? lol) be so bad for ya: <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/language-is-friendship-and-familiarity/">it&#8217;s painfully easy to talk so much <em>about</em> Japanese that Japanese herself gets neglected</a>; it&#8217;s too easy to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp4339EbVn8">become the local priest</a> &#8212; <a href="https://www.chil-chil.net/compNewsDetail/k/blnews/no/10656/">spending so much time fixing other people&#8217;s families that you neglect your own</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.</p>
<p>Japanese people are not better than you. Japanese people are not smarter than you. Japanese people aren&#8217;t even (necessarily) more Japanese than you.</p>
<p>But guess what? It goes both ways.</p>
<p>You are not better than Japanese people. You are not smarter than Japanese people. You are not (yet) more Japanese than Japanese people.</p>

But our collective and individual freedom is, ironically, built upon our collective and individual slavery. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-three-laws-of-language-learning-version-3-0/">We are all slaves to the <strong>laws of practice</strong>. We are all slaves to the <strong>law of language exposure</strong>. <strong>This law is brutal</strong></a>; it is primal; it is some <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%93%E6%B3%95%E5%85%B8">Hammurabi Code</a>-level shiz. It must be obeyed. <strong>It punishes anyone and everyone who violates it &#8212; no questions, no exceptions, no shades of grey, no special pleading, no sentencing guidelines, no parole</strong>.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson">John Broadus Watson</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This is the law. If you do not come into contact with Japanese, you will not get used to it. If you stop coming into contact with Japanese, you will stop getting used to it.</strong> And if you are not used to something, you are, by definition, not good at it. This law is true for you; it&#8217;s true for me; and it&#8217;s true for every person on Earth, no matter the blood or tongue of their ancestors. <a href="https://american-phrases.blogspot.com/2016/08/like-it-or-not-whether-you-like-it-or.html"><em>Wapende wasipende</em></a>.</p>
<p>Back in high school, my last and best English teacher, a lovely man with a terrible drinking problem, called me an iconoclast. And I&#8217;ve worn that label proudly in the years ever since. But you know what? I&#8217;m not really an iconoclast. What I mean is, I&#8217;m not an iconoclast for the sake of being an iconoclast. In many ways, I am deeply &#8212; and I mean <em>deeply</em> &#8212; conservative, almost to a fault. I only rail against schools because they disobey all the laws of learning. Like my namesake¬†<a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=%E5%8B%9D%E5%85%83%E7%9B%9B%E6%AC%A1+%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDw5Poh4bbAhUP8WMKHUieCmQQ_AUICigB">Katsumoto</a> from <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%B5%E3%83%A0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4"><em>The Last Samurai</em></a>, I rebel¬†<em>for</em> the emperor. I rebel <em>for</em> the laws of learning, not against them.</p>
<p>Unlike Katsumoto, however, I have zero heroic impulses. Unlike Katsumoto, I would totally sell out for fun and profit (gotta be both though) lol.¬†As I loved to joke as a teenager: I am a man of my principles! I cannot be bought!‚Ä¶But I can be rented‚Ä¶ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Again, the point of investing is to take out more money than you put in. And in order to do that, you need to, first and foremost, <em>not lose</em> your money. In a similar vein,¬†the trick to learning Japanese is to know more Japanese today than you did yesterday. And in order to do that, you need not lose &#8212; i.e.¬†<em>not forget</em>¬†&#8212; the Japanese you already know.</p>
<p>Now, we do allow some losses. Some trades/investments go south. And <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it/">SRS allows us to, statistically, forget some things in order to remember more of everything</a>. Indeed, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-start-clean-start-dirty-why-a-clean-slate-is-bad-for-you-and-what-to-do-about-it/">trying to be totally perfect can prevent us from doing anything at all; it slows us down and limits us too much. Perfectionism is a druuuhg</a> and that makes it baaaad, mmmkaaay? Seriously, though, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/potheads-planners-and-players/">performancewise, <strong>being a perfectionist is just as bad as being a pothead</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/aim-to-fail/">Failure is not only permissible for success, it is essential. But this success-producing failure must needs be cheap, never catastrophic</a>. Thus, the overall trend we want to be in is one of not losing the plot, of <strong>not allowing mistakes of the blindingly obvious variety to be made, repeated or compounded.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-are-you-acting-like-a-deadbeat-dad-language-learner/">How do you raise a kid</a>? Well, first, you¬†<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-have-you-been-killing-babies/">keep them alive</a>. You prevent them from dying. Everything starts there. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/mastery-is-mastering-the-basics/">all about the basics; it always comes back to the basics</a>. The rest is details. There is not a single femtosecond in the life of a parent where keeping the child alive is not important. There&#8217;s certainly more to parenting than preventing death, but none of it negates the basics; none of it can even happen without the basics; you can&#8217;t boost your kid&#8217;s confidence if you don&#8217;t keep him alive first.<sub>Arguably, all child-rearing is death prevention: you prevent their bodies from dying, then you prevent their minds from dying and finally you prevent their souls (here &#8220;soul&#8221; = happiness, innocence and sense of wonder) from dying. As a childfree man, my child-rearing ideas are pleasantly abstract, unburdened by the clutter of actual experience, so take it all with many grains of salt <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</sub></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, so we&#8217;ve talked about immersion multiplexing previously:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;A lot of the best business literature is in English and remains in English. I need access to it. But I need to get and stay used to Japanese and Chinese as well. What to do? Do both.&#8221; [Secret Immersion Technique: Multiplexing | AJATT Plus] <a href="https://goo.gl/EKZhjK" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/EKZhjK</a></li>
<li>&#8220;You can listen to music speech. It&#8217;s surprising how little they interrupt each other.&#8221; [What Would Happen If You Went Mad Like Sparta and Started Immersing Like a Time Vampire-Killing Terminator Robot? | AJATT | All Japanese All The Time] <a href="https://goo.gl/uYx45G" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/uYx45G</a></li>
<li>&#8220;Multitasking is trying to produce multiple outputs at once. Like talking to someone on the phone while writing an email to someone else. Multiplexing is taking multiple inputs simultaneously. This, we can do. It&#8217;s loads of fun and the more we get used to it, the better we get at it.&#8221; [How to Do Immersion Multiplexing Using an Android Device (Tablet/Smartphone) | AJATT | All Japanese All The Time] <a href="https://goo.gl/MfQgHr" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/MfQgHr</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="https://goo.gl/MfQgHr">we&#8217;ve even covered recommended hardware and software</a>. Today, we are going to re-tread and extend the hardware/software discussion to include headphones.</p>
<p>Now, on a PC or Mac (laptop or desktop), multiplexing is pretty straightforward &#8212; just launch multiple tabs and/or multiple instances of your favorite tabs, and you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>But things get more complex when you&#8217;re using a mobile device. Mobile apps and mobile OSes (especially iOS) generally presume uniplexing.</p>
<p>After dozens of purchases, returns, resells, repurchases and months of testing,¬†here is a quick rundown of the hardware and software that carries the Khatzumoto Seal of Approval &#8212; the very tools I&#8217;m currently using to make multiplexing happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device #1 = Cheap unlocked Android smartphone (3 audio streams):
<ul>
<li>Software:
<ol>
<li><strong>Rocket Player</strong></li>
<li><strong>Neutron</strong></li>
<li><strong>PowerAmp/Audible/YouTube</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Headphones: Bose QuietComfort 35 Bluetooth Headphones
<ul>
<li>If I recall correctly, the only difference between series I and series II is that the latter plays nice(r) with AI assistants like Google Assistant, to the point that they come built-in or something like that. Not sure. Series I is fine for our purposes.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>iOS / iPhone (if you&#8217;re willing to settle for, say, a 6 or 7 instead of an 8 or a X (ten), your mobile provider might give you yours for cheap or free (not &#8220;free&#8221; but actually free).
<ul>
<li>Software
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>YouTube or YouTube Music</strong>
<ul>
<li>Either play a fourth audio stream or some background music</li>
<li>At this writing, the Audible app sucks on iOS and has for a while. The Febe app sucks no matter what the platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>iSakura TV</strong> on Puffin Browser in Desktop Mode:¬†&#8220;1) Download &#8220;Puffin Browser&#8221; from Apps store. iTune¬† 2) Login iSakura Web TV&gt; browser setting&gt; Enable¬†&#8220;desktop mode&#8221; and &#8220;Game controller&#8221;&#8221; [mobile &#8211; isakuraiptv] <a href="https://goo.gl/MDsHvP" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/MDsHvP</a>
<ul>
<li>iSakura TV gets around the iOS audio focus limitations because it uses the Puffin browser in desktop mode, which means that you&#8217;re running Adobe Flash for real. Unfortunately, playback stops as soon as you switch apps, so I rarely get 5 audio streams playing simultaneously.</li>
<li>Using two Android devices would be an easy way to get 6 simultaneous streams, though <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> , so that&#8217;s maybe a cool future experiment to try.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Headphones: Cootree Wireless On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<strong>Cootree 220</strong> Sport Sweatproof Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Headset(Black and Red)&#8221; [Cootree 220 Sport Sweatproof Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Headset(Black and Red)-Smatree Gopro Accessory] <a href="https://goo.gl/FWtktd" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/FWtktd</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if I were a normal person, I would use a combination earphones and headphones (one pair of each &#8212; the former inside, the latter outside, obviously). But my ears are very sensitive and can&#8217;t handle having stuff inside them, so I had to find two sets of headphones (i.e. non-insertion type headgear) that can be successfully worn simultaneously. Also, I hate wires; they get caught everywhere, so wirlessness was a must. Your mileage may vary.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;In telecommunications and computer networks, multiplexing (sometimes contracted to muxing) is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a shared medium. The aim is to share a scarce resource.&#8221;<br />
<a href="https://goo.gl/iaj2gG">[Multiplexing &#8211; Wikipedia]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGFNGH9jHyM">Dru-uhgs are bad</a>. Multitasking is bad. Multiplexing is good.</p>
<p>Multitasking is trying to produce multiple outputs at once. Like talking to someone on the phone while writing an email to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplexing is taking multiple inputs simultaneously.</strong> This, we can do. It&#8217;s loads of fun and the more we get used to it, the better we get at it.</p>
<p><a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/secret-immersion-technique-multiplexing/">We&#8217;ve covered immersion multiplexing before</a>. It used to be something that required a PC or multiple portable devices. Now, with Android, we can do it off of one device.</p>
<p>The kind of immersion multiplexing we&#8217;re going to cover today (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/a-new-way-of-taking-book-notes-beyond-visual-information-overload/">in fulfillment of a promise made long ago</a>) is what&#8217;s known as <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/what-would-happen-if-you-went-mad-like-sparta-and-started-immersing-like-a-time-vampire-killing-terminator-robot/">multiple-barreled hearing (MBH) &#8212; originally, we called it double-barreled listening, but that implies two things are not entirely accurate, namely):</a></p>
<ol>
<li>that we are only taking two inputs at a time (we can do more than that), and</li>
<li>that we are actively paying attention &#8212; listening &#8212; rather than passively absorbing</li>
</ol>
<p>MBH is possible on Android because that platform makes it possible to create apps that ignore audio focus, i.e. that do not stop playing audio even if another app starts playing it. This capability and/or the apps that exploit it do not <em>yet</em> appear to exist on iOS, but I might be wrong about that.</p>
<p>The process of getting your MBH <a class="simple-footnote" title="Dear Gosh I hope this acronym doesn&#8217;t already mean something gross! lol" id="return-note-31584-1" href="#note-31584-1"><sup>1</sup></a> on is as simple as getting a reasonably (but not necessarily crazily) powerful Android device (if you don&#8217;t have one already), downloading a couple of apps and changing their default settings.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re an iOS person, getting an Android device just for playing media is, in my opinion, worth it. iOS is for great virtuosity (smoothness, stability, speed, design, visuals and reliability) but Android&#8217;s openness gives it as-yet-unbeaten versatility. Decent Android devices can be had pretty cheap these days, so think of your (extra, if you don&#8217;t have one already) Android smartphone as an awesome dedicated media player &#8212; <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/ipod-touch/">remember</a> <a href="https://ja.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMAD">those</a>? &#8212; rather than a phone.</p>
<p>Also, as an aside, <strong>I personally avoid buying mobile devices in Japan or Korea because they tend to not allow you to turn off the camera shutter sound, even when taking screenshots</strong>.¬†I can&#8217;t cosign that B.S., so overseas (i.e. anywhere they don&#8217;t over-regulate) is definitely the way to go. I can&#8217;t sit here rooting and jailbreaking something I supposedly own and paid for just to get it to not annoy me.</p>

<p>A smartphone will serve you better than a tablet, not only because the former are smaller but also because there are certain apps (such as¬†<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&amp;hl=ja">YouTube Music: the thinking man&#8217;s Spotify</a>) that are only available on devices classified as phones <a class="simple-footnote" title="You can spoof your device name to get around this but it&#8217;s a gigantic hassle." id="return-note-31584-2" href="#note-31584-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<h1>Android Software (Apps)</h1>
<p>Not all your apps need to be able to ignore audio focus, just as many of them as possible. Here are the top three audio player apps I know of that do this (as well as a quick note on how to change the settings in order for ignoring audio focus to happen [as you can imagine, ignoring audio focus is not default behavior]; I have included Japanese language info in some cases because my device is in Japanese and so the English is an educated guess (a re-translation)):</p>

<li>Ë®≠ÂÆö (Settings) ‚Üí „Ç™„Éº„Éá„Ç£„Ç™ (Audio)¬† ‚Üí „Ç™„Éº„Éá„Ç£„Ç™„Éï„Ç©„Éº„Ç´„Çπ (Audio Focus) ‚Üí¬†[UNCHECK BOTH] Temporary/Continuous (Permanent) Audio Focus Change</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s right,¬†<em>dis</em>honorable mention. I love Poweramp. The interface rocks. It ignores audio focus like a champ. BUT. It has this weird and rather unfortunate habit of¬†<em>stealing</em> audio focus from other apps whenever a track change occurs. Now, this audio focus kleptomania won&#8217;t affect apps like Neutron and Rocket, which ignore focus, but any app that doesn&#8217;t (which is most apps, including all the big boys, like Audible, YouTube and Spotify) will be turned off by it. Which sucks. So Poweramp went from golden boy to fond memory.</p>
<h3>Submissive Apps</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your audio-focus-ignoring (&#8220;dominant&#8221;) apps playing, you can choose any audio-focus-respecting (&#8220;submissive&#8221;) app you want, including the big boys. The catch is that only one submissive app can be playing at a time (since they tend to submit to each other).</p>
<ul>
<li>[YouTube Music &#8211; Google Play „ÅÆ Android „Ç¢„Éó„É™] <a href="https://goo.gl/HgvcpT" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/HgvcpT</a></li>
<li>[Audible („Ç™„Éº„Éá„Ç£„Éñ„É´) &#8211; Êú¨„ÇíËÅ¥„Åì„ÅÜ &#8211; Google Play „ÅÆ Android „Ç¢„Éó„É™] <a href="https://goo.gl/mbOV6x" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/mbOV6x</a></li>
<li>[YouTube &#8211; Google Play „ÅÆ Android „Ç¢„Éó„É™] <a href="https://goo.gl/iTYLD" class="autohyperlink">goo.gl/iTYLD</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Actual Use Examples</h3>
<p>My personal usage patterns have evolved over time (and continue to do so) but here&#8217;s the type of thing I do and have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neutron: Play music (why? Because Neutron give the most detailed control over volume, and you don&#8217;t want your music to overpower the rest of your stuff)</li>
<li>Rocket Player: Play a Japanese audiobook at normal or double speed</li>
<li>Audible: Play an English language audiobook at triple speed
<ul>
<li>I used to use Audible Japan (which works more like Netflix &#8212; all-you-can-listen subscription &#8212; than Audible USA), but it sucks hard in so many ways that leaned hard into buying audiobooks as mp3 filesets from Febe. You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Neutron: English audiobook</li>
<li>Rocket Player: Japanese audiobook</li>
<li>YouTube Music: Korean rap music</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Your imagination and powers of (non-?)concentration are the only limit on your abilities. Well, that, and, the number of dominant apps you can find. Also, you need pretty good headphones for this all to not sound crappy.</p>
<p>As time goes on, the more I do this, the more I find I can handle. Now, I get annoyed by an English audiobook if it&#8217;s not at triple speed (the Audible speedup algorithm is really good, no distortion whatsoever). You, too, will find the same.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s all from me for now. Hopefully this helps and makes some amount of sense. Give it go and lemme know!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AJATTeer Tom Lazarus (no relation, no known death experiences) shares an insanely great immersion technqiue that he affectionately (and rather pragmatically) dubs &#8220;double-barrelled listening&#8221;. As in, two barrels, like Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s movie characters&#8217; shotguns&#8230;or something&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to the idea of <a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/secret-immersion-technique-multiplexing/">immersion multiplexing (taking multiple simultaneous inputs on the same sensory channel)</a>¬†but madder and Spartaner. Here he is in his own words, sharing the story and benefits of <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-hours-building-listening-comprehension">his listening-hearing experiment:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Double-barrelled listening</strong></span> is when you have<strong></strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong> earphones from one device in one ear and earphones from another device in the other ear.</strong> </span>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with it for a few weeks now and here are my thoughts about it. The thoughts are quite disorganised.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can listen to music + speech. It‚Äôs surprising how little they interrupt each other.</li>
<li>You can add instrumental music to speech to pep it up (<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/chinese-project-notes-9-making-your-own-music">it‚Äôs a bit like doing hand-made mashups, but with only about 1% of the effort</a>).</li>
<li>You can mix ‚Äúdense‚Äù material (e.g, the constant talk of a panel show) with ‚Äúsparse‚Äù material, like a movie or song, so when the dialogue stops in one, you just shift your focus to the other.</li>
<li><strong>You will be very surprised at how easily your brain can jump from one to the other</strong>, and how easily it can tune out one ear.</li>
<li>You will train yourself for those social occasions where you want to follow two conversations at the same table.</li>
<li><strong>Time vampires</strong> I mean colleagues with legitimate concerns of long-range importance are more hesitant to get you to remove your earphones if you have two devices in your ears. I don‚Äôt know why.</li>
<li>If you remove one earphone, <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/compromise-maintaining-your-immersion-environment-without-completely-alienating-your-fellows%E2%80%A6or-yourself">people are usually placated</a>, and you can immerse in the other ear.</li>
<li>My local Taiwanese radio sometimes flies off into pleasant-but-useless (to someone getting used to Mandarin) English, Taiwanese, Hakka, Japanese, Korean or even Spanish. No worries: the other ear is standing by.</li>
<li>Suppose you‚Äôre faced with a short movie on YouTube. Will I like this? Will it have that much L2 in it? <strong>Surf risk-free with the other ear playing something of proven value as backup.</strong></li>
<li><strong></strong>Much of the time seemingly ‚Äúimmersed‚Äù when searching by <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/massive-turnover">massive turnover</a> is nothing of the sort. Loading something that isn‚Äôt in the language you thought it was gonna be, time spent waiting for something to load, etc. (Have you ever searched for the dialogue in <em>Last of the Mohicans</em>¬†at <a href="http://www.tudou.com/">Tudou </a>buffering speeds? <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-you-should-keep-listening-even-if-you-dont-understand">Hours down the drain‚Ä¶wasted)</a></li>
<li>You can listen to the same clip on repeat ALL DAY and explore new things ALL DAY. THE SAME DAY!</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ajatt/status/4772630674542592">Keep L1 audio chaperoned (suppression fire).</a></li>
<li>It‚Äôs basically MORE L2. How cool is that?</li>
<li>Watching something on your desktop when the phone/doorbell/bladder rings? Normally, that requires a conscious effort to get your mp3 player plugged in, and often you won‚Äôt be conscious enough to bother. An mp3 in the pocket is a great failsafe.</li>
<li>Battery and earphone <strong>failures in one device don‚Äôt leave you stranded.</strong></li>
<li>It‚Äôs much harder to get bored. One thing that gets old quickly + another thing that gets old quickly combine to make hours of not getting bored because you switch between them.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-problem-is-choice">Should I listen to something familiar or something new? BOTH!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/the-problem-is-choice">Should I listen to comprehensible input or something challenging? BOTH!</a></li>
<li>For tonal languages: music is more memorable and enjoyable, but speech does give me tones, which I want to get used to‚Ä¶ BOTH!</li>
<li>‚ÄúBreaks‚Äù used to be silence or L1. Now breaks are just one ear of listening. Psychologically level up.</li>
<li>Words distract my ability to read. Relatively quiet (but still audible) speech, plus relatively loud ambient music overcome this. Should I read or listen? BOTH!</li>
</ul>
<p>Load both barrels‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll hit more targets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having not tried this yet, I personally think Tom is crazy. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/do-it-itll-work">And that&#8217;s probably exactly why his idea is going to work <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a> . As my mentor Akihiro NAKATANI is fond of saying, you&#8217;re not doing it properly unless people are calling you crazy (<strong>you&#8217;re only on the right track if people think you&#8217;re crazy</strong>).¬†To the headphones!</p>
<p>Do you have a technique or success story of your own to share! THEN SHARE, THEN! Let us all know <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f600.png" alt="üòÄ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Comments or <a style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/contact">email</a><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">, your call <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> .</span></p>
<p>PS: Having tried out Tom&#8217;s ideas deliberately in earnest for a day or so, it&#8217;s plainly obvious that Tom isn&#8217;t crazy at all. He&#8217;s an engineer, not a madman, a pragmatist, not a romantic. What he&#8217;s talking about is the immersion version of what <a href="http://is.gd/f4SCxE">Nassim Taleb</a> has been talking about <a href="http://is.gd/pkgWwg">throughout <i>Incerto</i></a> &#8212; ridding yourself of having a single point of failure.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll definitely do well to have a backup/background immersion source in case the primary one fails due to human or mechatronic error. The latter form of error is surprisingly unrare, <i>especially</i> with newer devices, on which one never seems to be more than a few tracks away from a machine freeze.</p>
<p>Older, more feature-sparse units are decidedly unsexy and don&#8217;t titillate the inner neophiliac, but they&#8217;ve usually had all the kinks ironed out and so tend to be much more reliable. In my case, since earphones and headphones kinda seem to drive me crazy of late (maybe it&#8217;s a phase), I mostly have speakers do my heavy lifting for me &#8212; <strong>multiple devices, multiple speakers</strong>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peep this. So I&#8217;m in Vancouver. And I&#8217;m hungry for something awesome to put into my mouth. So I go into this Persian bakery, because that&#8217;s a good place to find awesome things to put into my mouth. So I&#8217;m walking in and guess what I see?</p>
<ul>
<li>A Persian bakery, with</li>
<li>Very good-looking Persian people in it
<ul>
<li>Including a gorgeous young woman (typical college age?) manning the till&#8230;well, the entire store, really</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Persian music playing, and</li>
<li>A guy at a table reading a newspaper &#8212; in Farsi!</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8230;And you <em>still</em> wonder how people can have accents (including the young person)?<br />
Let&#8217;s review. The people at this bakery were doing <strong>full spectrum</strong> Persian immersion &#8212; no cross-language multiplexing. They were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing Persian,</li>
<li>Reading Persian,</li>
<li>Speaking Persian, <em>and</em></li>
<li>EATING Persian</li>
</ul>
<p>Now imagine this happening every day for 20 years&#8230;</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s your critical period god now, skeptics?! Huh?!</p>
<p>My point here is: children aren&#8217;t magical. They&#8217;re just bad at immersion; they&#8217;re bad at controlling their environment. Children don&#8217;t even get to choose what to eat and when to sleep. Adults are amazing. Adults can re-create one country inside another. Reminds me of the American parties with American food and American people playing American games that I go to in Japan. Adults rule. Literally.</p>
<p>So next time you want to know how to do immersion, do it like a Persian <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="üòâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> . Also, visit your local Persian bakery, coz&#8230;dayom.</p>

<p>Language is peeing.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jamie3160">Jamie</a>¬†(yes¬†<em>that</em> Jamie), of Twitter fame, a leading authority on the urinary arts, actually came up with this analogy.<br />
To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m jealous, because I think it&#8217;s <strong>the best language acquisition metaphor ever invented</strong>. Ever.<br />
It&#8217;s like a golden shower of insight&#8230;</p>
<p>Because of the&#8230;golden nuggets of wisdom it contains?<br />
Wow. Crossed a few lines there.<br />
That R Kelly, when will he learn, eh lads, eh?<br />
Anyway, let&#8217;s look at:</p>
<p><strong>Approximately ten reasons why learning a language is exactly, 100% like peeing.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>No matter what you drink&#8230;
<ul>
<li>Mountain Dew (Anime)</li>
<li>Water (Unscripted natural conversation)</li>
<li>Milk (The Mo√´ Sentence Pack)</li>
<li>Ambrosia (Comedy)</li>
<li>Protein shake (<em>Star Trek</em>)</li>
<li>Green smoothie (<em>Evangelion</em>)</li>
<li>Green smoothie with added vitamins (<em><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%B1%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B2%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B2%E3%83%B3%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E7%89%88">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em>)</li>
<li>Green smoothie with added vitamins, made and served by a maid dressed in short shorts, with blue hair that completely covers one of her eyes: if you&#8217;d been there with me and the lads that night in Akihabara&#8230;you&#8217;d understand. (The part in <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em>¬†where Shinji&#8217;s eyes go red and he roars: „Äå<a href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%E7%B6%BE%E6%B3%A2%E3%80%81%E8%BF%94%E3%81%9B#hl=ja&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%E7%B6%BE%E6%B3%A2%E3%82%92%E3%80%81%E8%BF%94%E3%81%9B&amp;oq=%E7%B6%BE%E6%B3%A2%E3%82%92%E3%80%81%E8%BF%94%E3%81%9B&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;gs_l=serp.3...943662.944658.0.945129.6.5.1.0.0.2.184.545.2j3.7.0.ygki-bReRwU&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=8716e293e6dae011">Á∂æÊ≥¢„Çí„ÄÅËøî„Åõ</a>ÔºÅ„Äç )</li>
<li>Unfiltered gutter water (Textbooks) <a class="simple-footnote" title="I&#8217;m being flippant. Textbooks are useful&#8230;for about 10~300 seconds, after which the boredom infects and kills your will to learn" id="return-note-7018-1" href="#note-7018-1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/where-not-to-learn-japanese-from">&#8230;it&#8217;s all mostly made of water and it all comes out as pee</a>. All <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TppW12-MbJI">FUNBUN <a class="simple-footnote" title="For native, by native" id="return-note-7018-2" href="#note-7018-2"><sup>2</sup></a></a> Japanese is Japanese. Even &#8220;anime Japanese&#8221;.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#8217;t know exactly when you&#8217;re going to pee</strong>, but if you keep drinking, you will pee.
<ul>
<li>So stop freaking out about when you&#8217;ll get good or when you&#8217;ll start speaking. Everyone&#8217;s a little different! You&#8217;ll pee when you pee! Shut up and drink!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Worrying will get you nowhere. Just drink more. Keep drinking.</li>
<li>The more you drink, the more you pee. <strong>Volume(pee) <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%94%E4%BE%8B">‚àù</a> Volume(drink)</strong>.</li>
<li>Eventually, you won&#8217;t be able to help peeing: you won&#8217;t be able to help talking like a Japanese person. Eventually, it&#8217;ll be harder to <em>not</em>¬†pee than to pee. Sweet, huh?</li>
<li><strong>You always pee less than you drank</strong>: input and passive vocab will always outstrip output and active vocab. Input precedes and exceeds output. Never expect to drink a liter and pee out a liter. <strong>Volume(pee) &lt; Volume(drink)</strong>.¬†You&#8217;re going to pee out less than you drink&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;and you&#8217;re not going to pee at all if you don&#8217;t drink. <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/1-is-bigger-than-0">Nothing begets nothing. 0 begets 0</a>. No drink, no pee. <strong>Drinking = input. Peeing = output</strong>. There is no output without input.</li>
<li>There is no output before input, either. Drink now. Drink first. Pee later. You have to drink <em>before</em> you pee. You can&#8217;t pee before you drink.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="seriesmeta">This entry is part 3 of 4 in the series <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/wide-standards/" class="series-146" title="Wide Standards">Wide Standards</a></div><p>e_dub_kendo on <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/dont-have-high-standards-have-wide-standards">&#8220;Don‚Äôt Have High Standards, Have Wide Standards&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Khatz, just to clarify, this applies to the ‚Äústudy aspect‚Äù like doing SRS reps, etc, but given any 86,400 second period one should be striving to be in a Japanized environment for as many of those seconds as humanly possible right?</p>
<p>I guess what I‚Äôm saying is, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many kanji you learn a day, as long as you learn some, or how many sentence reps you do, as long as you do some &#8212; that totally makes sense to me.</p>
<p>But is immersion different? I know that there have been times when I was tempted to get slack about immersion, to stay in English even after things I NEEDED to do in English were finished, but because I have deeply drilled into myself this instinct to constantly maximize Japanese exposure, I have been able to overcome those temptations to get sucked into the 24-hour <em>NCIS</em> marathon on USA [Network] that was playing in the other room, and etc.</p>
<p>If I‚Äôd been taking a less hardcore approach, and expected less of myself in this regard, I can easily see days passing with very little time actually spent in Japanese. Basically doing a small ‚Äútoken‚Äù amount of immersion and then saying, well, as long as I do some each day that‚Äôs good and then tuning into the <em>Family Guy</em> re-runs (when in the he## is this gonna get a Japanese dub, btw?).</p>
<p>And, I think if my immersion fell apart like that, my SRSing and what-not would follow quickly behind it. Generally, slippery slope arguments are fallacies, but in this case, the pull of English is so powerful it really does create a &#8220;slippery&#8221; condition, I believe, and we must be on guard.</p>
<p>I feel like I haven‚Äôt worded this very clearly, but hopefully what I am trying to ask/address is coming through. Thanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>To put E-Dub&#8217;s question into 6 words:</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Do &#8220;Wide Standards&#8221; Apply To Immersion?</h1>
<p><a href="http://sylviahenderson.icmembershipsite.com/the-force-of-fulcrums/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6081" title="fulcrum-300x300[1]" src="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/data//fulcrum-300x3001.gif" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>They do, actually. In a weirdish way, though.</p>
<p>I currently practice what I like to call &#8220;leveraged immersion&#8221; (mixed with a technique called &#8220;<a href="http://plus.ajatt.com/secret-immersion-technique-multiplexing">multiplexing</a>&#8220;). Leverage in the sense of pivots &#8212; <strong>using minimal effort to get maximum results</strong>.</p>
<p>I have &#8220;wide&#8221; standards in terms of the effort I am willing to expend. But I want to get big results from it.</p>
<p>What does that mean in practice?</p>
<p>When I was in college, doing the &#8220;original, ÂÖÉÁ•ñ AJATT&#8221;, before there was a website or a name for what I was doing, when it was just a personal experiment, a little game, I had traction.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how far I could take it and what would happen if I did. Well, <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%A5%E3%81%9F%E3%80%81%E8%A6%8B%E3%81%9F%E3%80%81%E5%8B%9D%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F">I came, I saw, I got used to</a>. The whole of my world was in English and I was in danger of becoming monolingual for the first time in my life. I didn&#8217;t want that. So I playfully&#8230;very playfully&#8230;pushed against it.</p>
<p>Obviously, the experiment produced impressive results, and I wanted to extend it. Higher, further, faster, deeper. More Japanese. More of other languages. A lot of my writing can sound rather fruity and hippie-ish, but there is a side of me that loves the core ideas of organizations like McDonalds and Wal-Mart, that shares the¬†American corporate penchant for massive-scale, plug-and-chug replication and systematization, that makes out with pictures of Ayn Rand taped to my pillow (don&#8217;t&#8230;don&#8217;t judge me).</p>
<p>But the trouble with saying &#8220;no English&#8221; is that it can feel like deprivation at times. It was fine when it was just a game &#8212; &#8220;let&#8217;s see what would happen if I said &#8216;no English'&#8221; &#8212; but now it feels more like oppressive prohibition than playful restriction. Before I was doing it just because. Now, I&#8217;d doing it because: &#8220;Khatz must practice what he preaches&#8221;. And you&#8217;d be doing it because &#8220;Khatz practiced it and now preaches it&#8221;. Well&#8230;screw that. That&#8217;s dogma. We don&#8217;t need that. We need pragma.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t say &#8220;no English&#8221;. I just don&#8217;t allow English media on any of my good &#8212; best &#8212; machines. I let English exist &#8212; there are business books I need to read that are untranslated &#8212; but I don&#8217;t allow it on my best/most convenient hardware. English can be around, but it has to settle for a second-class existence.</p>
<p>So<span style="color: #ff0000;"> it&#8217;s not &#8220;<strong>no English</strong>&#8220;, it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;<strong>no <em>convenient</em> English</strong>&#8220;</span>. It&#8217;s not &#8220;no English&#8221;, it&#8217;s &#8220;no <em>unaccompanied</em> English&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sort of a <a href="ttp://www.amazon.co.jp/s?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=1207&amp;creative=8415&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=80%E5%AF%BE20%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%95%E5%89%87&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Pareto principle</a> thing. The machines and physical spaces on and in which I spend 80~90% of my time, and which account for the majority of my computing power, have no English going on &#8212; they&#8217;re reserved for Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>So I can watch <em>Family Guy</em>¬†if I want, but it&#8217;ll have to be on my iPad (she&#8217;s been demoted to bi##hbox status), over a Wi-Fi connection, with chintzy speakers, in the kitchen, standing up. Meanwhile <a class="simple-footnote" title="This is the multiplexing part" id="return-note-6080-1" href="#note-6080-1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the nice Bose speakers and 90-inch projector screen right next door are playing a Stephen Chow movie. And I can hear the Stephen Chow movie. And there&#8217;s this obscenely comfy beanbag right there, right in front of Stephen Chow.¬†There&#8217;s no competition.</p>
<p>I can watch <em>Family Guy</em>¬†if I want, but there has to be Japanese/Chinese playing and audible at the same time. Maybe some reps going as well. In other words, the English has to be <em>accompanied</em>; it has to have a &#8220;chaperone&#8221;.¬†Case in point:¬†I&#8217;m playing <a href="http://track.webgains.com/click.html?wgcampaignid=42525&amp;wgprogramid=1120&amp;wgtarget=www.yesasia.com/global/search-anime/ghost-in-the-shell/0-0-0-bpt.48_bt.48_q.ghost+in+the+shell_ss.107-en/list.html#&amp;l=1&amp;sb=149&amp;bt=48&amp;ss=107&amp;bpt=48&amp;vn=33&amp;cid=109&amp;s=7&amp;q=ghost+in+the+shell&amp;vm=32&amp;pl=3">Ghost In The Shell (Cantonese version)</a> as I write this English post <a class="simple-footnote" title="This is what we call &#8220;splicing&#8221; or &#8220;sensory split&#8221;" id="return-note-6080-2" href="#note-6080-2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What AJATT was and is&#8230;is <strong>total immersion in principle <a class="simple-footnote" title="(and in name)" id="return-note-6080-3" href="#note-6080-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, but Pareto majority immersion in practice</strong>. It&#8217;s <em><a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%87%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88">de jure</a></em> totality and <em>de facto</em> majority. Now, it happens that:</p>
<ol>
<li>In college, during the original AJATT process, I was always aiming for 100% total immersion, even though I only ever hit it a few times &#8212; Thanksgiving Break, etc.</li>
<li>In college, my apartment <a class="simple-footnote" title="and when I moved into a house, my bedroom" id="return-note-6080-4" href="#note-6080-4"><sup>4</sup></a> was a 100% Japanese zone. It literally was Japanese soil. It was&#8230;I had&#8230;an <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%96%E7%B4%80%E3%82%A8%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B2%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AE%E7%94%A8%E8%AA%9E%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7">AT field</a> <a class="simple-footnote" title="(wow, way too much Evangelion¬†for me)" id="return-note-6080-5" href="#note-6080-5"><sup>5</sup></a> around it and everything.</li>
<li>You (E Dub Kendo) and I have both grown into adults with almost total control over space and time &#8212; we can be wherever we want &#8212; at home &#8212; doing whatever we want almost 100% of the day. We&#8217;re time billionaires (although, as I&#8217;ve discussed before, this actually turns out to be a <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-do-people-who-have-all-the-time-in-the-world-get-nothing-done">&#8220;lottery winner&#8221; perspective of our time wealth</a>¬†&#8212; because of overhead and &#8220;time taxes&#8221;, in actuality we have maybe 2~6 hours per day more than regular civilians; we&#8217;re not just rolling in time <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/duck-tales-theme-song-2">like Scrooge McDuck rolls in gold coins</a>, and we can&#8217;t directly re-generate our time through savings and investments).</li>
</ol>
<p>So we feel like we <em>should</em>¬†go for &#8220;total&#8221;, and we feel bad when we don&#8217;t. The only reason we never went total before, the only reason other people don&#8217;t go total is because they don&#8217;t have the control that we do. But we have control. So shouldn&#8217;t we go total? Well, maybe not. Like I said, I have business books to read, seminars to watch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/critical-frequency-a-brand-new-way-of-looking-at-language-exposure">critical frequency</a>/<a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/probability-over-certainty">probabilistic algorithm</a> thing all over again. It&#8217;s engineering (imperfect functional perfection) over mathematics (abstract perfection). <a href="http://oshiete.goo.ne.jp/qa/1158529.html">IMHO</a>, we want to approach this like engineers <a class="simple-footnote" title="and statisticians" id="return-note-6080-6" href="#note-6080-6"><sup>6</sup></a>, not mathematicians <a class="simple-footnote" title="Besides, mathematicians seem to go insane and commit suicide at an alarmingly high rate.

<p>What about the slippery slope? Well, there is none any longer. We&#8217;ve literally <a href="http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/comfort-zone-growth-zone-panic-zone">inverted the slope</a>. All convenient paths lead to Japanese. All our best gear is there. You can go English if you want, but it&#8217;ll suck. Who wants to stand up in the kitchen when <em>Evangelion</em>¬†is on the big screen? I certainly can&#8217;t be bothered&#8230;</p>

<p><span style="color: #808080;">PS: Should regular civilians &#8212; wage slaves, people at school, etc. try leveraged immersion? Yes and no &#8212; mostly <strong>no</strong>. Certainly not as much as say, housewives and freelancers and NEETs and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4905042097?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-22&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;camp=1207&amp;creative=8411&amp;creativeASIN=4905042097"><span style="color: #808080;">NR</span></a> people. For civilians &#8212; people who don&#8217;t have full control over all their time &#8212; their lifestyle already forces partial immersion on them anyway, so it&#8217;s not something they need to do consciously; <strong>they&#8217;d get better results with a deliberate focus on maximizing the immersion function at all times and in all places</strong>. So the &#8220;old ways&#8221; still apply.
