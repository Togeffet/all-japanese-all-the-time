					<description><![CDATA[Will:

sounds a lot like the Tabata protocol....short intense bursts of exercise, rewarded by interval rest.....all wrapped up in a much bigger timer for the workout. (dual time-boxed)

You can Tabata anything by playing with the times....and from personal experience, it works great for the most painful, procrastination prone tasks out there.  The shorter and more intense, the better: the focus becomes more about the pain/reward cycle than just about how painful a task is.


Link explaining.  Has some Japanese relevancy to boot (Dr. Izumi Tabata):

					<description><![CDATA[khatz,

I do something very similar to this and I completely agree that sometimes shorter, more concentrated spurts of work will help you get more done. But I just can&#039;t help feel you are leaving out some very important insights on taking breaks. Being the recovering workaholic that I am, I realize that taking some quality rest or even a quick two minute break to just meditate and relax will make you a much more productive worker (Niel Fiore, http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/ anyone?). 

IMO It&#039;s just so much more inspiring when you have some FUN to look forward to between your bouts of productivity.  This fun will be in a some L2 or L3 that you are currently taking steps to OWN, of course.
