					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz (or any other reader of this comment)
How do you find something interesting in a subject? Like is there a good way to explore a subject because I don&#039;t really have money to just buy a lot of random textbooks. 
 
For example. Right now I&#039;m dying of boredom from my Biology class and when I try to do &#039;q&#039; and find it boring I do &#039;r&#039; instead. Unfortunately that isn&#039;t of subject &#039;Biology&#039; because I pretty much don&#039;t know whats fun or interesting about it(and this, of course, is subjective).
Thanks in advanced]]></description>
