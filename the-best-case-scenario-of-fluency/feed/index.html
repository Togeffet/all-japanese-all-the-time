					<description><![CDATA[Great post. There are so many naysayers online -- &quot;Oh, anime is bad for learning!&quot; &quot;Let&#039;s plays and youtube videos use too much coarse language!&quot; &quot;AJAAT/RTK/anything other than a textbook is useless and doesn&#039;t work!&quot; I&#039;m a chronic over worrier/researcher, so it&#039;s difficult for me to tell myself, &#039;what do these guys know&#039; and &#039;who cares if it works or not as long as I enjoy it?&#039; I&#039;m really glad that this blog post was here for me when I needed it. Your last part about &quot;a path of happiness and not to happiness&quot; is so true. If you can&#039;t find happiness in what you&#039;re doing right here and right now, then what&#039;s even the point?

Thanks so much!!! Your blog posts are so inspiring and helpful and I&#039;m incredibly grateful you share them with us!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Yesterday’s happy goal is today’s invisible baseline.&quot;

This is so true. I was playing a visual novel today without and help from software or dictionaries and was doing pretty well enjoying the story and characters. There were of course few words here and there I didn&#039;t know but it was enough to understand what was going on. It then hit me &quot;wait when could i play these type of games without stopping to look every other word up in the dictionary!?&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can relate to a lot in this post, such as the part about people getting worked up because you&#039;re doing your own thing.
I encountered a lot of social resistance for learning Chinese. Some peeps didn&#039;t like that I would rather do what I want to do than what they want to do. &quot;You don&#039;t have to do Chinese&quot; peeps would say. I also don&#039;t need to not do it, nor do what others want me to do.

Making friends isn&#039;t hard these days. There are tons of people in the world who no doubt share many of our interests. What does it matter if so-and-so won&#039;t do such-and-such with you? Find someone else, or find something else to do.

&quot;(if you tell them it was easy, they say it was genes; if you say it was perseverance and hard work, they say it was perseverance genes)!&quot;

Man, I&#039;m no stranger to this one. I&#039;m also known for going to &#039;extremes&#039; - which is layman&#039;s terms means &#039;more than I do&#039; - and some people are convinced I&#039;m either a genius or have a special chip inside me that makes me want things more than they do. &quot;I don&#039;t have [imaginary gift] like you do&quot; they say. &quot;I will never have the thingymejiggy that you have&quot; they say. Not with that attitude, that&#039;s for sure.

The reason I&#039;m more &#039;extreme&#039; than most people isn&#039;t because I have a special chip or care more, it&#039;s the opposite. I acknowledge my suckiness and I don&#039;t care. I do it because I can.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Are you happy that you can speak English? No.&quot; 

I&#039;m DAMN happy I can speak English. When I was like 10 or 11 I was constantly like &quot;it would be sooo cool if I could speak English already.&quot; Of course, I guess this only applies to non-native speakers :p]]></description>
