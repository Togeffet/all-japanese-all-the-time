					<description><![CDATA[I can see how this question inevitably leads to the MCD insight!
 
 Should you write out the entire sentence from your flashcard, or should you concentrate on the part you&#039;re actually trying to memorize here? We don&#039;t have time for every perfectionistic &quot;effort&quot;, we gotta focus on what we need the most right now (that&#039;s the very basis of SRS theory!)
 
 Why not tailor the SRS to function in that way to begin with? Why not concentrate on only one kanji from the sentence and if you feel like learning other kanji from the same sentence, just make one more flashcard for each one of them? Same sentence, but now the &quot;cloze&quot; (blank) is another kanji...
 
 When I first read about MCDs I didn&#039;t fully get why they were so intelligent. Now, reading this post, I understand it! It really makes sense! I&#039;m beginning my studies and that&#039;s what I&#039;m gonna try! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This isn&#039;t really related to the post (sorry!) and it might seem kind of obvious to some, but I wanted to bring this up for those who are (like me) sometimes kind of slow on the uptake.

If you have and iphone or an ipod touch, you have to get the &quot;kanji&quot; app - it costs $0.99, and it has all of the kanji (well, 2000 of them) with their English readings plus Japanese readings. It also has a search function (you can find kanji by English meaning, Japanese pronounciation, or by drawing it with your fingers/stick and having the app recognize what you drew). What that means is that not only can you learn/review kanji on the go, but you can also use it as an electronic kanji dictionary.

I just got it and I can&#039;t believe I was ever considering using a paper kanji dictionary while I read on the train/subway. Waaay too long...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found myself in the same situation as J.R. Unlike him, instead of asking for advice I just dropped the copying out of the sentences. I noticed that even though I didn&#039;t care for my lack of writing ability, I started missing an other aspect of the exercise. I therefore took the habit of doing a repetition, closing my eyes, speaking the sentence, and checking any mistakes.

 I found it useful to iron out specific grammatical aspects/mistakes, such as using は/が、書いたほうがいい/書くほうがいい... Two words of caution: 
1° Make sure you keep your sentences as short as possible (which you should anyway). 
2° Even though it speaking is less time consuming than writing, it is still mentally tiring. It might then be a good idea to choose specific items, as other commenters noted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I honestly don&#039;t even bother with writing out the sentences. At all. Kanji, yes. Sentences no.

Sometimes, when I&#039;m bored, I&#039;ll just write in Japanese and try to do things from memory... But as far as writing out entire/pieces-of sentences for *each* entry, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get carpal tunnel+tendonitis+burnout quickly.

Writing is important. If it helps your reading, great! However, reading is far more important and, strangely enough: the more you read, the better your handwriting will become automatically. 

Similar to the more times you see a Santa Claus/kitten/dog/beer-bottle, the more details you will remember about it over time, and the better chance you have of reproducing a drawing of said object from memory.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[J.R. .... of the Tolkien ilk?

Regardless of his family&#039;s literary past, it is a good question. I once tried writing out each sentence as part of an &quot;experiment&quot; and the result was a hideously deformed reviewing monster which I could not control. This translate to: It took too much damn time! Writing out the failed/forgotten sentences would be useful, as it would help to consolidate the knowledge of the words as well as help you remember how to write some kanji-specific words (I think most of us have no problem with writing out hirakata).
However, I would still warn against trying to write out each sentence, because, as Mr. J says, you burn out too quickly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is interesting because I just changed how I do this. 
I use anki, so there are 4 possible scores. Now my scoring system goes like this:

1-misread anything in the sentence
2-read the sentence correctly but it wasn&#039;t smooth, or I wasn&#039;t totally confident on a reading.

At this point, if I have read the sentence smoothly (this applies mostly to older cards), i try to write it down without looking at the screen. Ideally, I&#039;ll write the whole sentence, but this isn&#039;t always necessary. This once again reinforces the importance of SHORT sentence items, but if the sentence is long by necessity, then I select only the most important parts to write down-what it is I am trying to learn in that particular sentence.

If I am able to copy the sentence correctly, but need to look at the screen to correct myself/check for errors, I score the sentence a 3.

If I am able to copy the sentence correctly, from memory, without referring to the screen again, then it gets a 4. Therefore a &quot;perfect&quot; score on a sentence requires me to both read and write the sentence smoothly.

I&#039;ve been doing it like this for about two weeks, and we&#039;ll see what happens. I hope it will enable me to produce the words I am learning more readily than what I was doing before. It also made me realize that with my previous scoring system, I had rather a lot of sentences that were &quot;old&quot; but that I was still not completely smooth at for either reading or writing.

For reference here&#039;s how I used to do it.
I used to have Anki automatically generate two cards one was a &quot;reading&quot; card - the score is based on how well it is read out loud. The other card was a &quot;writing card.&quot; Basically, this card would ask me to produce the kanji for a particular target word (i.e. new word) given the reading and the context. This is similar to how Japanese high school kids take Kanji tests (i.e. the Kanken (漢字検定））

Doing this, I found doing my of &quot;Reading only&quot; cards to be incredibly sleep-inducing, and was looking for a change. I liked my &quot;writing&quot; cards, they gave me more 達成感 than any of my other cards, but they did require a lot of time, and in the end seemed redundant to have two cards for the same thing.

I hope this new way should eventually save time and be less boring. Hoping, praying, that it will save time and be less boring...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Right now I&#039;m working with two sets of cards, for recognition and for production. I&#039;ve got a larger deck that&#039;s JUST recognition -- and I don&#039;t worry about writing, period. Those cards are longer sentences from authentic materials, often with several new vocabulary words. And then I&#039;ve got a smaller deck that&#039;s just production, with one new kanji on each and short sentences from test-prep materials: 酒にヨウ、祖母は食事中に話すのがキラウ、ソファーを布でオオッタ。Those, I write out every time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062;This is of course all assuming you’re doing the “classic”/”original”/”vanilla”/”recognition”-type sentences, where you are to read aloud and understand a sentence written in actual Japanese.

Just out of curiosity, what sort of sentence (item) would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; fall under this category?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve configured my SRS to show failed and new cards first. This way, I can start out writing down every sentence I come across until I stop feeling like doing it, without having to give any extra thought on whether or not that particular sentence is really worth it.
And after I&#039;m done with writing, I can turn off the lights, lean back and just tap space and the numpad as I read the remaining sentences at a rate of one per 10-15 seconds, instead of 1 per 1-2 minutes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always wondered, do you guys use both production and recognition cards in Anki? Right now I use both, but it seems like I could get a lot more done if I wasn&#039;t spending time translating English sentences into Japanese during production.]]></description>
