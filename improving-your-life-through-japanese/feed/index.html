					<description><![CDATA[&#039;cause you&#039;re talking also about work out, I&#039;ll give you this link: http://www.fitocracy.com/register/?invite_code=YI5ZE
It is &quot;fitocracy&quot;, you can create an account and track your workouts, for every excercice you do you have points and pass to the next level. You don&#039;t win anything, it is simlpy a site to track your progress, but passing a level, for me, is very motivational, it seems like a game and it give me the will to do something and don&#039;t simply stay on my couch.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The timeboxing has been a great change in my life.  I&#039;m doing more of my own writing an hour before I start teaching school.   I use the Silverspoon time management arrangements everyday but really it&#039;s just arbitrary.   I&#039;ve been reading Steve Chandler books which Khatz refers to every now and then in addition to self-help books in Japanese (yes, the books I&#039;m embarassed to say I like:)).   I&#039;m so busy as a dad of two small children and a high school teacher.   I use a vibrating G-Shock watch and read 3-5 minutes every day, and I&#039;m &quot;rubbin&#039; it.&quot;  (Okay, that sounds gross and xenophobic but it&#039;s all about McDonald&#039;s).      Good stuff and thanks.]]></description>
