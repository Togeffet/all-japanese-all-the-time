					<description><![CDATA[One thing I have noticed is that I get more pleasure out of completing chunks of tasks that I&#039;m working on. A common pitfall for me with timeboxing, and quantifiable action, was when the structure and quantity of what I was working on was small enough to do in a short period of time. Getting that gratifying feeling of finishing your reps for the day is easy to lose yourself in, and when the reps number in the &#039;too many&#039; range, its easy to try and finish them anyway. There have been plenty of times where I&#039;ve sat down for hours to catch up on a thousand or so reps. For me, it&#039;s about knowing when a timebox is better, or when just finishing something off is better. Of course, when a project is too large to break down into small chunks, then a timebox is the best kind of chunk to be using.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The way I went with SRS is more like 3 seconds of it, all the time. I would just leave the SRS tab open all day and just do a word/sentence or two whenever I felt like it; often I&#039;d be watching something and when there was a quiet, relatively inactive scene I&#039;d quickly go through a few flashcards. Or I&#039;d be reading something and switching to SRS every few seconds.
So I never really dedicated any time to SRSing. It was just always there. I was bound to get through them all within a 24 hour period. I went through hundreds of flashcards a day this way (I use past tense because I don&#039;t need to add many flashcards anymore).

So my recommendation is don&#039;t even do 3 minutes. Do 3 seconds.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There have definitely been too many times where the number of cards left has made Anki slightly painful. 

I fixed that problem with books in school when I was constantly reading every chance I got. Instead of thinking of the chunks being chapters, think of them being paragraphs. Most novels don&#039;t have really long paragraphs, so use that. If you want to make the chunks less variable (or you&#039;re just quicker at reading). Then go by page. Advancing the story only really requires one sentence, so a paragraph or page at a time is plenty.

If you do something like that, you&#039;d be amazed at how much reading you can get done. It&#039;s probably even faster than reading large chunks at a time since you only got a little taste of the story between the door and your office, in between classes, during your lunch break, etc.
It really helps to get a smaller bookmark if you do this though to emphasize the progress and the how much you are actually progressing (for the record, they also stay in the book better).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What would happen if you altered your SRS to stop telling you how many cards you have left? It&#039;s useless information. The point isn&#039;t to &quot;finish&quot; your reps, it&#039;s to do them. The fact you have $x cards left shouldn&#039;t be a factor when deciding how many to do. That number is a barrier to starting, and may be one of the biggest design flaws an SRS can have.

I have a similar problem with lots of books. The chapters are too long. It takes commitment to read just a little bit more. Therefore, I don&#039;t read, at least until I can stomach the thought of another bite that probably tastes great, but doesn&#039;t fit in my mouth.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, I&#039;ve been unintentionally doing tihs for years!
Except that I&#039;ve divided all my time into chunks of &quot;songs&quot;. Yeah that&#039;s right, my ears are so glued to my mp3 player of choice I&#039;m pretty much obliged to in order to keep track of time.

Goin&#039; to that place . . . 3-5 songs. Doin that thing . . . maybe 2.

Now all I have to do is apply. Like, at the start of this song. . .I&#039;ll start doing this. And if I don&#039;t wanna at the beginning of the next, move on to something else. Next song, move back (if I have to) cuz you know, I might still need to get shit done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, this past weekend, I decided to make the switch from Surusu to Anki, because Surusu requires an Internet connection to use at all times, but I can get AnkiMobile on my iPhone that isn&#039;t connected to cellular service and do it while I&#039;m on the bus for two hours a day going to and from work. (I am an iPhone app developer, so work has given me an iPhone to test apps on, but I haven&#039;t gotten my own iPhone and won&#039;t be getting one until October or so lol).

Provided I stay on schedule, in three days I will be completely caught up. My entire Surusu deck will be moved over, and every card seen. Last night I finished out the RTK1 Kanji in Anki, and remember, I started transitioning a week ago. Last friday. Over half of the RTK1 Kanji were seen on day 1.

How?

Two things:
- 1 minute timeboxes (my Anki timebox setting hasn&#039;t been set to anything other than 1 minute since re-installing it)
- very liberal deletion (more liberal than usual, which I guess I want the usual, but I sometimes get attached too easily, but with this little project I seem to be cleaning things up pretty nicely).

Basically, one minute timeboxes are so short and easy that they&#039;re addictive. I&#039;ve done 500 or more reps every day since installing Anki and AnkiMobile, and that&#039;s insanely huge for me. On day 1, I did 1500 reps in a day -- a new personal record (previous was 600).  And, any time I saw a card was hindering my want to do another minute after the first, I went into the next minute with every intention of exterminating that card to make sure things stayed fun and addictive, because even a single minute can be tiring if the cards suck.  In the end, I did 5400 reps in eight days (today included, and I&#039;m not done with today; that number also does not include deleted cards), and I could quite comfortably keep up these sorts of stats because of how fun and addicting 1 minute timeboxes are, especially when combined with liberal deletion.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, this past weekend, I decided to make the switch from Surusu to Anki, because Surusu requires an Internet connection to use at all times, but I can get AnkiMobile on my iPhone that isn&#8217;t connected to cellular service and do it while I&#8217;m on the bus for two hours a day going to and from work. (I am an iPhone app developer, so work has given me an iPhone to test apps on, but I haven&#8217;t gotten my own iPhone and won&#8217;t be getting one until October or so lol).</p>
<p>Provided I stay on schedule, in three days I will be completely caught up. My entire Surusu deck will be moved over, and every card seen. Last night I finished out the RTK1 Kanji in Anki, and remember, I started transitioning a week ago. Last friday. Over half of the RTK1 Kanji were seen on day 1.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Two things:<br />
&#8211; 1 minute timeboxes (my Anki timebox setting hasn&#8217;t been set to anything other than 1 minute since re-installing it)<br />
&#8211; very liberal deletion (more liberal than usual, which I guess I want the usual, but I sometimes get attached too easily, but with this little project I seem to be cleaning things up pretty nicely).</p>
<p>Basically, one minute timeboxes are so short and easy that they&#8217;re addictive. I&#8217;ve done 500 or more reps every day since installing Anki and AnkiMobile, and that&#8217;s insanely huge for me. On day 1, I did 1500 reps in a day &#8212; a new personal record (previous was 600).  And, any time I saw a card was hindering my want to do another minute after the first, I went into the next minute with every intention of exterminating that card to make sure things stayed fun and addictive, because even a single minute can be tiring if the cards suck.  In the end, I did 5400 reps in eight days (today included, and I&#8217;m not done with today; that number also does not include deleted cards), and I could quite comfortably keep up these sorts of stats because of how fun and addicting 1 minute timeboxes are, especially when combined with liberal deletion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Completely agree...this timeboxing-kaizen mashed awesomeness might be the true magic bullet against procrastination. 
This works when you don&#039;t feel like or your energy is down, because you do just a little and get all the good feelings associated with completion.
This is also why most of the time you cook stuff in small bits, as opposed to throw in the whole motherload and then bitch about it staying stubbornly uncooked.]]></description>
