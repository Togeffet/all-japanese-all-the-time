					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always considered your site to be a &quot;Personal Development&quot; site above a language learning site because the truth is, you&#039;re not teaching me &#039;jack&#039; about Japanese :-P (but telling me all the juicy tips on where to get such a noble edjumucation) 

Anyway, I just wanted to ask about the fast-food link. I didn&#039;t get what you were getting at, because there is no mention of fecal matter or dying children pristine white or otherwise. It seems like a bad attempt to criticize honest, hard-working individuals who found a better way to do business successfully and *gasp* honestly by using a personal brand of &#039;personal development&#039; we could probably learn from. (At one point, the author seemed disgusted that a honest businessman was not ASHAMED of being so successful.. because what, PROPER success is guilt-laden?) Is that why you linked? I&#039;m just completely lost on the connection...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First comment after 15 months of lurking (and studying) :D

Thanks for the verbal slap in the face, Khatz. I don&#039;t particularly need it at the moment - motoring along quite nicely (though fluency in 15-18 months ain&#039;t gonna happen - maybe 24-36?) - but it&#039;s bookmarked for the next time I start making excuses. Also, you&#039;re 26? I always thought you were younger than me (clearly I fail at maths). The knowledge that we&#039;re the same age makes me feel better... even though you&#039;re fluent and I&#039;m nowhere near it. Ummm, yeah. 


@Maya

You WIN, you do. Chalk me up as a person helped : ) I can already recite the English version of Alice In Wonderland by heart (every line, every poem, every song, right down to the intonation) - now I can do it all again in Japanese!


@Daniel &#038; @Matt

26 is clearly the prime age for language learning ; ) 

And smoothie drinking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post Khatz.

As rude as some people might think you are, I find you to be an awesome mentor. I think it&#039;s all about having the right attitude towards language learners when preaching them, I mean, I&#039;ve read it too many times already..&#039;It won&#039;t work for everybody&#039;とか, &#039;Not everybody could reach the same results&#039;とか and other lines coming from those who &#039;think&#039; they&#039;re helping us when they&#039;re doing nothing but wasting their time and more importantly, ours.
 
Keep up the good work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Ken 

Well I can&#039;t really switch my computer to japanese ,as I have to share it with other people, in the near future i&#039;ll buy myself a really really solid laptop and just make it pure Japanese. I&#039;m trying just to put sites that i visit, such as youtube to japanese. 
Yea I think since I haven&#039;t really applied it much, kinda frustates me abit, Everyone wants results but obviously that takes time. But I&#039;m trying to apply it to school, sometimes i just write random stuff in japanese, and ppl do tend to look and say &quot;What&#039;s he writing down?!&quot; lol I remeber i randomly wrote like a paragraph of sentences of in japanese and one girl was like &quot;YOU KNOW JAPANESE!?&quot;. I was like no i suck at japanese! lol Maybe i;m not giving myself enough credit or something but i still suck badly. I&#039;m sure the input will be able to get me fluent in 1 years time since i do spend quite a large amount of time doing sentences+reps and immersion. But output hasn&#039;t come just yet for me. I think my problem is just to apply it and try to see how good i&#039;ve gotten so far. But input i&#039;ll do on my own, but output i&#039;ll try practising even if it&#039;s early on, like khatz said, if you want to do output early it&#039;s good just have the person who you are speaking to correct you ruthlessly lol.  So far i&#039;ve went to 3117 kanji and 3700 sentences in 6 months.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[アメド: I&#039;m only at the kanji stage, but I find that SRS&#039;ing *by itself* can become boring (or frustrating, since -- as Khatzu points out -- it only shows me what I suck the most at).  My fix: apply it!

When I walk through the International District, every week I find I can read a little more of the signs.  I went to a Chinese restaurant with some friends on Saturday and I could read half the kanji on the cover of the menu (not technically Japanese but who cares?).  On one of the twitter feeds I read (they&#039;re great because they&#039;re short sentences but real Japanese!), I could read a *whole sentence* today -- because one of the kanji was one that my SRS has been showing me constantly for the past couple days, and I was *finally* able to write it this morning!  (But I could easily read it, since reading is 5x easier.)

It also helps me to see that the things I used to think were hard, are now easy.  When I flip open my kanji book to page 30, I can remember struggling with those, but today I can easily name every one.  So I can imagine a day when I think the whole book is easy.

Here&#039;s an idea: with that much kanji, you can probably get around on your computer pretty well.  (You *do* have your computer set to Japanese, don&#039;t you?)  So go into your GMail preferences and set the language to Korean for 2 minutes.  Holy cow I can&#039;t read a single thing, or even pronounce anything, and all these characters look identical, I swear, and ... OK, OK, breathe, it&#039;s alright, I&#039;ll just switch it back to something easy ... Japanese!  :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[SRSing is starting to become boring recently, or maybe it&#039;s just today lol had so much tests, just feeling so lazy to continue my 100/day sentence routine. Only been 6 months(3 months kanji+3 months immersion+sentences). I&#039;ve reached 3600-3700 sentences so far. I think the main problem for people to continue is the motivation, that always effects me. Like today i don&#039;t feel like doing my sentence reps(it&#039;s 769 cuz i was missed one day of reps). I&#039;m lucky that usual my motivation is just linked to my energy. So when i&#039;ve got lots i always continue. I haven&#039;t gotten any output yet, only thing is for output is probably easier to say things+read. But what i&#039;ve noticed when i try to write from memory is that, it takes more input to produce output. So i&#039;m convinced with large heavy input, it&#039;ll eventually lead to some really high level output. But i think it&#039;s good to just do both lol. Work on output with japanese people and do input on you&#039;re own, and in 1 years time, it&#039;ll both collide and produce pure ownage!]]></description>
