					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all well and good and I agree with you but at some point people need to listen to some amount of Japanese even if it takes them 15 freaking years to get 5,000 hours of exposure to the language.
There&#039;s this teacher who told me that I should listen to 15 minutes of English/day to improve my listening comprehension. BTW, this teacher&#039;s English sucks. He makes pronunciation mistakes and is generally not very good at the language. Surprising? I think not.

					<description><![CDATA[I once was outside a shop that literally was titled &quot;Brilliant Schmuck.&quot; (german speaking country, of course). I took a picture. It made me happy. x3 But I digress...

I never realized that people actually take it so literally. I&#039;ve always been the sort to absorb the parts of advice I like or think are compatible with me, and jettison the rest. To outer space. Sometimes I&#039;ll try out a bit more as homage for clever snarkiness. But at some level many (or all?) people are afraid of freedom because they worry they can&#039;t handle it properly. That they will EPICPHAIL. Or something like that. I know we&#039;re not supposed to be like that in this new enlightened age of empowerment, but even the people who &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; obediently conform to this can&#039;t just up and do it, as that would be a paradox in their thinking. People like stability and certainty because they can leave it unattended without worrying that it&#039;s gonna start something that may or may not be good. Or they can prepare for the outcome in advance. Anyway. Baby steps~

I have some advice for you. And I won&#039;t hold it against you either if you mull over whether or not to take it. Go write for a newspaper column or something in your spare time. You have a flair for that lovely sort of blunt humor that makes people think, unless they really have their guards up and their minds as closed as possible. Even when I find myself ticking off disagreements I still read through to the end because it&#039;s entertaining.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ironically, this is fantastic advice.  It can be a hell of a struggle to break free of that regimented form of thinking if that&#039;s what you&#039;re used to.  (Which I definitely am.)

But once you start dropping advice that is not working for you and using the advice that does work, something strange starts to happen.  You often start discovering your own unique methods that work specifically for you.

It took an extraordinarily large amount of time for me to come upon this information on my own, so the fact that it&#039;s now posted for all to see will probably help many who have the same problem.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ke6i, the blah blah blah phase really sucks. All I can say is to fiddle around with your sources as much as you like... for me I liked watching things I had once seen with subtitles or read the book or something, so I knew what was going on. Also things that are very visual work well for me at that stage. And I find it works better not to sweat the words I don&#039;t know, and just to enjoy the ones I do... until I head a word six times and still don&#039;t get it. Then I look it up.

Also, khatz, for some reason the blog looks squished or decentered on my computer. Maybe it&#039;s since the last firefox update? There&#039;s a big beige empty space to the left, and a narrow little text box to the right. Looks fine in IE.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think, a lot of what you might be percieving as people looking for minutiae is people reading your site, realizzing you&#039;ve achieved something they want to achieve, and simply wanting to find the easiest, most efficient method for reaching that same achievement.  I know I personally fit this category, with my own recent questions.  Here I&#039;ve tried &lt;i&gt;dilegently&lt;/i&gt; and usually in a &lt;i&gt;disciplined&lt;/i&gt; manner to try to learn Japanese for four years, several times getting discouraged and slacking off when I didn&#039;t seem to be making any real progress.  Then I find this website and here&#039;s this dude that achieved what I want, fluency in Japanese, in 18 months, and he says he had fun doing it.  So, as I begin to implement some of his ideas, I run into a couple areas that either seem inefficient, or aren&#039;t fun, or just aren&#039;t working for me.  So, my thought isn&#039;t so much to ask questions so I can follow your instructions to the letter, as it is that I figure you or someone who reads the site has probably encountered this before, and I&#039;m wondering what sort of solutions they came up with, because I want to find the most efficient and fun means to go about things, in fact, need to find the most efficient means because of certain physical limitations which I discussed before.
I think you have a lot of great ideas, and I fully realized you got many or most of them from others.  But, I also figure that if I have a problem, it is likely you or others have encountered it before and have some ideas to save me time.  If it wasn&#039;t clear, I mostly worked out those problems on my own, but simply took into consideration the ideas presented by others.  I think sometimes you worry a little too much about people blindly following your advice, when they probably just don&#039;t want to re-invent the wheel if someone else has already built a really good one.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think, a lot of what you might be percieving as people looking for minutiae is people reading your site, realizzing you&#8217;ve achieved something they want to achieve, and simply wanting to find the easiest, most efficient method for reaching that same achievement.  I know I personally fit this category, with my own recent questions.  Here I&#8217;ve tried <i>dilegently</i> and usually in a <i>disciplined</i> manner to try to learn Japanese for four years, several times getting discouraged and slacking off when I didn&#8217;t seem to be making any real progress.  Then I find this website and here&#8217;s this dude that achieved what I want, fluency in Japanese, in 18 months, and he says he had fun doing it.

					<description><![CDATA[This was a good post for me. I think I need to work on the ordering side of the relationship as much as the interpreting orders side. Because I spend so much time deconstructing things I&#039;ve heard and read, I think the POV that I&#039;ve built for myself is the best one, and forget that other people will be just as different as me. The way we tell other people things probably reflects our thought process just as much as the way we tell things to ourselves.

It seems to me that the best road is equal parts cynicism to reject things, and optimism to accept good things and stay excited and hungry for more information. 

On a totally unrelated note, does anyone have and suggestions for Japanese SF books?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That wasn&#039;t cyclical and self-referential at all :p

I do very much agree though with the idea of not following every last piece of advice to the letter, and am surprised every time anyone does.  Seems pretty obvious that no-one is going to be dishing out advice that is perfect for everyone.

Everyone is a unavoidably a composition of everything and everyone around them, and it&#039;s odd that they&#039;d ever consider trying to take advice from just one source.  It&#039;d be a pretty weird world if they did.]]></description>
