The time we&#039;re wasting here( myself included lol) is time that we could be studying Japanese. Khatz puts out all kinds of Ajatt merchandise. Everyone isn&#039;t going to like all of it.

Paying less than $2 a day to have Khatz plan things out for me saves me hours per day which I can use to do paid work.  I&#039;m actually saving money by being subscribed!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Cush: You can do what you want.  It&#039;s just a guide.  In between recommended activity you can do what you want.  Take a break? Up to you.. It&#039;s the AJATT method but having stuff I wouldn&#039;t know how to find, found for you.  You choose to use it or not use it.  The most important thing is that it keeps me on the path and makes me excited to think of what is coming the next day.  I don&#039;t look at the next day&#039;s content before work as it makes the journey to work fun.  When could you ever have said that travelling to work was fun?

Personally (being a member) the things being offered so far are examples of things I wouldn&#039;t be able to find myself.  (As I can&#039;t read Japanese, hence mine japanese websites for media).

I&#039;m enjoying it so far.  I come to work with a smile on my face because I know that in 563 days i&#039;m going to be fluent in Japanese.  If i&#039;m not fluent in Japanese I get all my money back in one go.  *&#062;&#062;ALL MY MONEY BACK&#060;&#060;* 

What did I have to lose.. Nothing.

If anything it&#039;s forced me to get organised(ish).  I&#039;ve dug out my old Ipod and put Japanese things on it.  I&#039;m watching Drama every night and have removed my usual English media (apart from this blog) from my environment.  I&#039;ve stopped playing my English video games and stopped watching TV in favour of internet Japanese media.  I never did this just reading the blog.  I would always procrastinate.  I would always binge like Khatz said, get bored/frustrated at my lack of progress and fall of the wagon.  

As I now have an end goal that is tangible, it made me stop being lazy and get with the program.]]></description>
