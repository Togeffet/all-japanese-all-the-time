					<description><![CDATA[Great idea! However, the Japanese bookmarklet doesn&#039;t seem to work any longer (it only displays 10 search results per page instead of 100).

					<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;ve kept trying to use the URL++ bookmarklet, and it still doesn&#039;t seem to work...

Is it supposed to be where I&#039;m looking at the search page with all my results, then click the URL++ bookmarklet and it somehow adds all the results to the shuffler?

Because no matter how long I wait it&#039;s only the search results page that comes up in the shuffler.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh -- there&#039;s a delay (a &quot;waiting period&quot;, if you will). You add the URL with one click, and then Surusu puts the page in a queue, in order to balance the load on the server. Give it 10~30 minutes. Your links will be there. :D
(Another benefit of the queuing is that you can go nuts and add a kajillion webpages at once without experiencing any slow-down).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dang this sounds amazing! Surusu is making incredible leaps and bounds, pretty soon there will be no excuse not to use it.

But I&#039;m trying to implement the Google.co.jp search bookmarklet from here along with the URL++ one to add up to 100  links to the shuffler and it&#039;s not working...whenever I click the ++ bookmarklet it only adds the search page to the shuffler, not the actual hits.  Maybe I&#039;m just missing something obvious but I&#039;m stumped. Anyone know what I&#039;m doing wrong?]]></description>
