					<description><![CDATA[Well I said that without knowing your location or situation. If that&#039;s the case it&#039;s not a big problem, the internet is the only thing you need! You just need to manage your bandwidth efficiently. What I mean is: be sure to download something that is at your current level, therefore not too high and not too low. 

Perhaps you could get just the first 1-2 episodes of T&#038;D before deciding to set out on that looong file transfer.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not in Mozambique, though. You know, many times Africa is referred to as third world. I don&#039;t agree entirely. I would give the classification:
Europe, America, some parts of Asia, Australia, Northern Africa and SOUTH Africa and some of the Southern Africa -&#062; first world
poor countries of Europe, America, Asia -&#062; second world
poor countries of Africa(including Mozambique in its ACTUAL state) -&#062; subworld NOT third world
even poorer countries of Africa -&#062; no world practically.
Look, I&#039;m not analyzing regarding peace, or whatever other than economy.
Sorry for the long answer but I think this is all just to say that buying an original DVD just isn&#039;t an option. In Mozambique, there are no japanese multimedia products available. :( :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nivaldo,
If it&#039;s gonna take that long, and occupy most of your bandwidth, and you have a time-based fee, then buying the original DVD *may* be more economical. Certainly easier and faster :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not really the case of configuring the BT, I just have a very short bandwidth. It only allows me to download 10KB/s at best. Besides, on weekdays I have internet only from 7:00PM until 7:00AM and yet I&#039;m allowed only 1 hour and half at home. I calculated that in an hour and half I can download 0.5% of the whole. So, calculating the number of the remaining days was easy but sad, some 200 days which dividing by 30 gives 6 months approx.
About T&#038;D, thanks for giving me it&#039;s nature. It sounds quite interesting. Thank you. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really? You should tr to configure BT properly.

Basically, in T&#038;D, Rakugo is used as a medium to advance the story, usually a subplot of a main character. Near the beginning, sometimes in the middle, of each episode, you are told a classic rakugo tale. Then, as the episode progresses, parts of it start to resemble the claical plot, until at the end, Kotora, the yakza-rakugo protagonist adapts the classical story completely.]]></description>

据我所知，“华语”这个单词的使用者只限为东南亚这一带的华人。但是，和“普通话”，“国语”，“官话”
等的名称比较的话，我觉得“汉语”，“华语”等是比较地中立的。

ほとんどいない翻译成中文是“差不多没有”的意思。你不是也在学习日语吗？]]></description>
