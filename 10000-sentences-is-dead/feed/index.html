					<description><![CDATA[Same for me. I took all the parts of MCD I loved (+1 effect, highlighting instead of clozed and more context) and applied it to my old sentence deck.
MCDs just took too much time for me to review when I could have been reading all the books I was dying to read.

					<description><![CDATA[Yep! It was the slave, I was the master. It was getting annoying so I killed it, which you can do to a slave if you like, don&#039;t forget. Hopefully this MCD thing will be more cooperative. In the meantime, the 8-day vacation from the sentence plantation is panning out rather nicely :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If SRS is preventing you from reading, ditch your SRS (or atleast the method in which you are using your SRS).  It&#039;s your slave, not your master.  Only use an SRS where it helps, not hinders.  Maybe MCDs will help, but more importantly, make sure you aren&#039;t forcing yourself to do any SRS for anything that you just as easily enjoy without it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I suggest not thinking about it purely in terms of MCDs VS Sentences.  MCDs to me was just realizing that I can make better cards by

 1.  simplifying the difficulty of each card, in trade for possibly more cards.  This means on troublesome reading doesn&#039;t cause 2 other easy readings to get over repeated and boring.

2.  Lots of context is good, when you can get it and it makes sense.

3.  Cloze Deletions can really help with particles and other grammar constructs.

For me, I didn&#039;t ditch my plain jayne sentence deck.  But I have been slowly increasing my deletes of bad cards, or fixing cards that I like that I think could be better designed.  If you keep going from one extreme to the other, you may spend more time focusing on the technical format of your SRSing over fixing what things are uninteresting to you, and slowing your study down.]]></description>
