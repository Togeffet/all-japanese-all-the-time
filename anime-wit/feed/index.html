					<description><![CDATA[That sort of attitude is just a strange form or jealousy being projected. I think I understand it. It&#039;s like &quot;Hey, you didn&#039;t have to work hard to learn Japanese and I took 2 years of it in college. WTF!&quot; 

Someone once posted &quot;You have to learn Kanji just like the Japanese and that is by rote memorization.&quot; This was on a video I posted about learning Kanji using RTK1. I mean, learning through anime takes time and work too. It just doesn&#039;t feel like work because it&#039;s not boring. Meaning it&#039;s easier for the brain to absorb the information and patterns. 

I guess the best thing you can say to this person is &quot;Try it! You&#039;ll like it!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know how anybody could even believe it in the first place. 
Somebody had to create a script in the first place, and obviously you have to understand it if you write it, and somebody also has to say it, so, at least for me it was debunked from the start.]]></description>
