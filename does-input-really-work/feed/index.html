					<description><![CDATA[&quot;...but with input you can learn to read sentences of a much higher number and greater length.&quot; 

I get the number thing, but what about the length? What maximum length can you recommend for sentences? Or does it even matter how long a sentence is, as long as someone sticks to the x + 1 rule (one new/ unknown word in every sentence)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this is sooooo true. Right only at 1500 sentences and i can feel like naturally able to understand things easier. My readings are better like i can read alot of random comments on youtube,from the web,etc,etc. Input is greater/easier to learn then just random output in the beginning. animes i can understand 70-80% now and dramas as well but not all dramas just yet. I guess this will all come in due time. I managed to go monlingual which is abit diffcult but it&#039;s good b/c i can already understand a good majority of the sentences due to exposure,etc,etc.]]></description>

@Charles A.
“Getting all 3 for $15 makes it even better.”
Where did you get the Japanese verison of those movies for that price?
We can get drama series here in Singapore for about 10% of the Japanese release (legit) but I’ve never seen anyone selling Japanese dubs. Amazon doesn’t sell them that cheap either.

********

I live in Japan, so they&#039;re just normal DVD&#039;s that are at bargain bin prices. Sorry to get your hopes up. Still, if you have friends in Japan (via language exchange sites), perhaps they can get cheap DVD&#039;s to send to you. Or, if they&#039;re game, just rip the videos (with subtitles) and host it somewhere. 

By the way, the Subtitles are WWAAAYYY off the dialogue. Granted, that goes with Khatzu&#039;s article about Subtitled TV Shows. I think it&#039;s more like they dub to try to match the mouth, but the subtitles are more precise translations. Distracting but not a show stopper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Mark

You&#039;re right. As, Charles A. suggested earlier, it looks as though the process goes beyond pure input and includes a lot of &quot;mediated output&quot; or &quot;highly controlled output&quot;, or &quot;output with instant and constant error-checking and error-correction&quot;.

Theory arguments are kind of stupid, anyway. Just shut up and go play, you know? &quot;Human beings can&#039;t run a mile in under 4 minutes&quot;. Whatever, zip it and go running. You&#039;ll learn a lot more and be a lot happier quietly running an experiment than getting into arguments [been there, done that]. In learning a language at least, shoot first, ask questions later.

It is also entirely possible that a single mountain can be climbed in more than one way. And it&#039;s also possible that apparent diffs of opinion are really just misunderstandings.

無論如何...keep on climbing! One foot in front of the other in the direction of up. That&#039;s all that matters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;[1] Input actually allows you to learn MORE, and more correctly, than just output. There is simply a limit to how long of a sentence (and how many sentences) you can actively recall in a single day, but with input you can learn to read sentences of a much higher number and greater length.&quot;


Hmmm...I read an interesting article on the Supermemo website the other day ( http://www.supermemo.com/help/faq/memory.htm#Reading ), which states that:

&quot;Active recall is needed to guarantee the high retention as defined by the forgetting index (even 99%). Depending on volume, structure, delay, etc. passive review may leave as little as less than a percent of recall. However, reading books for the sake of learning English is not just passive review. Each time you encounter a problematic word, the need for comprehension will automatically trigger an active recognition test in which the stimulus is the word in question and the response is its semantic association. This is active recall&quot;


I have personally been under the impression that AJATT/Antimoon relied on &#039;passive&#039; recall, which is supposedly not as effective as the &#039;active&#039; methods of learning promoted by Supermemo. And I have seen this &#039;fact&#039; used elsewhere as a way of discrediting AJATT/Antimoon. But the above seems to suggest that AJATT/Antimoon is NOT actually passive at all! So, perhaps it was just me, but it now seems that AJATT/Antimoon and Supermemo are in fact in accord - all is well with the world.

Actually, I have just been using the AJATT method on the basis that &#039;it works&#039; irrespective of the apparent contradiction with any &#039;accepted&#039; methods of learning, but it is interesting to see that those doubters elsewhere will now have to come up with another justification when disparaging AJATT/Antimoon :)  Still, maybe I won&#039;t bother finding out how they will adapt and continue to disparage AJATT/Antimoon - maybe I&#039;ll just get on with becoming fluent...

What&#039;s in the answer field in at that point (my japanese is not good enough for me to understand the examples you gave hehe).

					<description><![CDATA[Also If your scared of putting only Japanese in the answer field, don&#039;t be. It&#039;s surprising how fast you get used to J-J translations. I remember the first time I used J-J I would understand 30% of the definition. so would take another 5 minutes looking up all the other words to be confronted by even more words to look up and so on. And It can be really easy to think OMFG this is gonna take forever. but I started to cap things off at about 3-5 links down the chain and then quickly peek at some english to make sure I understood the words. So I would end up understanding the whole sentence for my SRS then I would write the definition all in Japanese. A lot of the time it would take me longer to learn the meaning of the definition than the actual sentence. but everything fills itself in. as you know one part of the equation as it were. I just told myself I didn&#039;t want to see any English characters In any fields from the start. and the definitions give me input as I&#039;m reading them on top of the original sentences! 
But what I&#039;m trying to say is before you know it you won&#039;t need to use English to look up any more, as you just get used to the language in the dictionary. and everything just becomes a lot more efficient.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the answer, Khatz! I was in doubt only because sometimes I feel like &quot;Yahoo! I got this and that in English perfectly but not the other thing&quot;, especially common objects in everyday life. What I know in english is more technical and social like friends, games. But things like the different types of clothes, or common parts of the human body or objects that you use at home are still unknown in my internal vocabulary. So I thought I could expand on this but now I know, my dream was, is and will always be 日本語. Thanks once more!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A bit OOT, but today I just bought a senior high textbook on 漢文　(Classical Chinese with added Japanese 送り仮名 and 返り点). I was surprised at how easy it was for me to read compared to 涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱 which is a teen &quot;ライトノベル”. The only problem I have with the textbook is the occasional archaic Japanese translation of a Chinese sentence, but working from the Chinese I can still get the gist of it. 

So Khatz, is non-fiction on the whole easier to read than fiction, or is it just for textbooks? Perhaps there are more idiomatic expressions in fiction than in non-fiction? I guess the sciences would be far more self-explanatory in Japanese than in English simply due to kanji compoundsね.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[quendidil,
you probably (and understandably) took it for one of my typos instead of the manufacturer&#039;s. I wouldn&#039;t worry too much :)

khatz,
thanks for the suggestion!

&quot;being non-Japanese and fluent in Japanese is still enough to get you on TV&quot;
Does this mean you have been on TV? I&#039;d certainly want to see that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh lol, I didn&#039;t even spot the い missing. Is that a bad thing? That my brain is sort of filling in the gaps in japanese? Like in English where you don&#039;t notice typos?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@nivaldo
tough question. I vote for Japanese, just because (1) your English is already good and, (2) the socio-economic returns for being a fluent Japanese user tend to increase with fluency [being non-Japanese and fluent in Japanese is still enough to get you on TV, and also carries enough &quot;shock value&quot; (&quot;OH-MY-GOSH-IT-SPEAKS-JAPANESE?&quot;) to be useful in social and business situations], whereas English fluency, while useful, is often taken for granted. Plus kanji are super cool.]]></description>
