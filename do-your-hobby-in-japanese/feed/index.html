					<description><![CDATA[Writing is my main love. Of  course I can write in Japanese, but I&#039;m already writing a book in English, and writing loses its magic when you don&#039;t have a good grasp of the language you&#039;re writing in. The whole point is to use your words to weave magic, and I can&#039;t do that in Japanese. YET. Lol, I&#039;ve just finished memorizing kana. So...I&#039;ve got a long way to go.

Do you think timeboxing my writing, listening to Japanese audio while doing it, and taking breaks to read Japanese text is a good enough way to keep up on both my language learning and my writing at the same time? I&#039;m thinking five pages a day and the rest of my entertainment in Japanese.

I can&#039;t wait until I can write well in Japanese...kanji look so beautiful and expressive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think your making the right decision. I want to add tho that for people learning Japanese there seem to be a lot of hobbies that are &quot;Japanese Hobbies&quot; like manga, anime, comedy cause Japan has a huge entertainment/art culture in that way. So I guess if those things are already your hobbies you just have it easy. For me learning Mandarin I have yet to find a hobby or something entertaining enough from that culture that is exclusive to that culture and that I would rather be doing than something from the North American or Web2.0 culture. I like a lot of aspects of the Chinese culture but so far those aspects have been mostly mindsets and ways of living. People in this situation could possibly find some Chinese people share rent with or move to China at some point but in the mean time I think its best to make sure they have other interests.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Also I think its fair to mention that you should have other hobbies besides learning Japanese to effectively enjoy Japanese through your hobbies. There was a point in my Chinese learning where I had met a few Chinese international students at school and we had organized a language exchange. They were asking me what my hobbies were and I realized my only hobby was learning Chinese and looking for the best method(including reading all Ajatt Posts) to learn Chinese. Its extremely embarrassing awkward and eyeopening when L2 Natives ask you &quot;what are your hobbies?&quot; and you can only vaguely remember what your hobbies were before you became obsessed with learning another language. 

Also it&#039;s not fun trying to learn a language with this energy or mindset or whatever. It might start off fun but once the level of acceleration of your learning starts to drop and you realize this thing your so obsessed with will take another 14 months to grasp, it gets ASM really fast. I mean sure take the time to figure out how you learn best and what works for you, but don&#039;t do it obsessively like wanting to know your L2 Asap. IMO its not about learning it asap, granted its not about taking the least efficient path either but its about learning by doing which a lot of students almost have no concept of except maybe in math. Its a journey and it can be fun if you let it. If you obsess over it past the point where its fun to obsess, you enter ASM territory. 

Before that, or right as you hit that, you need to make the decision to remember/figure out what you want out of life besides languages. Passions, people, health too please, and then install your L2 as an interface to your life in only the ways that are fun. That is a sustainable lifestyle. IMO as someone who took things too far with the 50 Hanzi a day and burnout bad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Kawaiimouto, I sooooo agree with you! I enjoy drawing so I went on yahoo Japan to look up drawing instructions in Japanese. With a little effort using my pop-op dictionary and looking up unfamiliar grammar, I was able to navigate just enough to get myself by. In a short while I learned new words and some kanji. Though many of them pertaining to drawing, but nevertheless, learning took place and I enjoyed it. I learned words like 下書き (draft) and new kanji words like 見直す (review) .  If I wanted to, I coud create some flashcards out of this. I will plan on doing this at leasta page at a time so as not to get overwhelmed.

Good luck!,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really advise you to turn on the Japanese setting on Guild Wars. Why? Because, it&#039;s needed. And you being hooked with it is even better.

The only way you will get good with Japanese is to do it. My poor English knowledge when I was 5 and 6 didn&#039;t stop me from playing text heavy RPGs like Final Fantasy. 
You&#039;re a Japanese child, and children do stuff that adults do, no matter how much they know the language.

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, it was the same for me too, I love games, I love Pokemon, I really was eager to play the newest Pokemon games (Pokemon Black, then Soul Silver) as soon as possible rather than waiting for them to be released in English...but each time, it was far far too frustrating. For me, I&#039;ve found doing my hobbies in Japanese can be the fastest way possible to make me not enjoy my hobby, and truly HATE Japanese (for ruining the fun I&#039;d otherwise have with my hobby). It also teaches me to tune out Japanese, which is not what I want to be doing, if there&#039;s a lot I don&#039;t understand it&#039;s overwhelming and becomes just irrelevant noise. I&#039;m not learning anything if I&#039;m ignoring all the Japanese in the game.
For me, I&#039;ve found it&#039;s not efficient, I can struggle with a game for hours and only learn one new word if anything, instead I could spend the time using a guide like Tae Kim&#039;s and learn in a more structured way. It&#039;ll vary depending on the individual, I think, personally, I like (good) textbooks, so using one isn&#039;t an issue for me, I&#039;ll have more fun doing that than messing around with something that&#039;s way over my level. No, I can&#039;t read Kokoro (my other hobby is reading) yet, maybe it&#039;s not really worth torturing myself trying. It&#039;s so painful to me not to be able to read, it really does feel like that.
On the other hand, it can work Ok, if for instance it&#039;s already a game I know very well. I&#039;ve learnt a lot of Japanese from Tales of the Abyss (a game for which I basically know the English script back to front). What made the difference with that was it has an anime adaptation, so I could just watch, if I&#039;d had to play it I would have just got frustrated again. I think you really have to *love* the material as much as I love that game for it to help much, though, or it can quickly become uninteresting and frustrating due to the extra barrier Japanese can feel like it places between you and the material.
There&#039;s also a lot of extra material for that game that&#039;s only available in Japanese (manga with extra story etc.), so I think that&#039;s good motivation, if anyone has a hobby with material they can only access by learning Japanese (martial arts, bonsai, figure collecting and building, idol singers etc.), it&#039;s at least very motivating, though trying to read it before you really feel ready may not be any fun. For me it&#039;s still just frustrating, and these manga are something I want to read really really badly, not something I&#039;m just &#039;meh&#039; about. Actually I think that&#039;s part of the problem - it&#039;s much worse to not be able to understand something I really want to than it would be not to be able to understand something I was only vaguely interested in. I&#039;d get frustrated much less quickly if it was something I cared less about.
 
So, I think involving hobbies can work and be helpful, and are something you&#039;ll naturally gravitate towards anyway since it&#039;s what is most interesting to you (especially for those in the オタク crowd for whom their hobbies are part of their motivation to learn Japanese in the first place). I also feel it can be a bit of a double-edged sword, because it&#039;s easy for it to be a source of frustration, and end up generating unreasonable expectations. I mean, here&#039;s me getting fed up and upset because I can&#039;t perfectly understand material I know full well is aimed at older teens or adults, rather than appreciating I&#039;m doing Ok to understand *any* of it. You naturally expect to be able to function in your hobby at the same level you&#039;re used to doing in English, rather than recognising that you may still be an infant in Japanese terms. So, no classic novels for me yet, but maybe I can read fairy stories.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree, it was the same for me too, I love games, I love Pokemon, I really was eager to play the newest Pokemon games (Pokemon Black, then Soul Silver) as soon as possible rather than waiting for them to be released in English&#8230;but each time, it was far far too frustrating. For me, I&#8217;ve found doing my hobbies in Japanese can be the fastest way possible to make me not enjoy my hobby, and truly HATE Japanese (for ruining the fun I&#8217;d otherwise have with my hobby). It also teaches me to tune out Japanese, which is not what I want to be doing, if there&#8217;s a lot I don&#8217;t understand it&#8217;s overwhelming and becomes just irrelevant noise. I&#8217;m not learning anything if I&#8217;m ignoring all the Japanese in the game.<br />
For me, I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s not efficient, I can struggle with a game for hours and only learn one new word if anything, instead I could spend the time using a guide like Tae Kim&#8217;s and learn in a more structured way. It&#8217;ll vary depending on the individual, I think, personally, I like (good) textbooks, so using one isn&#8217;t an issue for me, I&#8217;ll have more fun doing that than messing around with something that&#8217;s way over my level. No, I can&#8217;t read Kokoro (my other hobby is reading) yet, maybe it&#8217;s not really worth torturing myself trying. It&#8217;s so painful to me not to be able to read, it really does feel like that.<br />
On the other hand, it can work Ok, if for instance it&#8217;s already a game I know very well. I&#8217;ve learnt a lot of Japanese from Tales of the Abyss (a game for which I basically know the English script back to front). What made the difference with that was it has an anime adaptation, so I could just watch, if I&#8217;d had to play it I would have just got frustrated again. I think you really have to *love* the material as much as I love that game for it to help much, though, or it can quickly become uninteresting and frustrating due to the extra barrier Japanese can feel like it places between you and the material.<br />
There&#8217;s also a lot of extra material for that game that&#8217;s only available in Japanese (manga with extra story etc.), so I think that&#8217;s good motivation, if anyone has a hobby with material they can only access by learning Japanese (martial arts, bonsai, figure collecting and building, idol singers etc.), it&#8217;s at least very motivating, though trying to read it before you really feel ready may not be any fun. For me it&#8217;s still just frustrating, and these manga are something I want to read really really badly, not something I&#8217;m just &#8216;meh&#8217; about. Actually I think that&#8217;s part of the problem &#8211; it&#8217;s much worse to not be able to understand something I really want to than it would be not to be able to understand something I was only vaguely interested in. I&#8217;d get frustrated much less quickly if it was something I cared less about.<br />

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve played through a few Japanese games, and didn&#039;t feel the need to look up every single word I didn&#039;t know. 
Well, I thought I should at first, but realised that&#039;s too hard.
Remember that it&#039;s just reading practice, anyway. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wrote up a reply to this, but I don&#039;t know what happened to it? Oh well.
 
Anyway, with the exceptions of Pokemon and Skyward Sword (where I hand-transcribed everything I wanted to learn, which means I didn&#039;t actually SRS much from either game), I&#039;ve used text dumps or other peoples&#039; transcriptions. Google a few lines of dialogue from whatever game you&#039;re playing and may find a dump or transcription. Every Zelda game (神々のトライフォース、時のオカリナ、ムジュラの仮面、風のタクト、トワイライトプリンセス) and every Final Fantasy game (6, 7, 10) I&#039;ve played has them available, along with Chrono Trigger.
 
Also, on the Guild Wars in Japanese thing, if it&#039;s not much trouble, change it now and see what happens. If it&#039;s too hard, then change it back and just turn on a Japanese podcast or music (or audio rip from an anime or drama you like).]]></description>
