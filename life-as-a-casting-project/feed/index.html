					<description><![CDATA[Thank you!  This was an extraordinarily timely post.  I was becoming a bit frustrated and, consequently, a little lazy in my language study.  Your post made me remember that I&#039;m out to master Korean, and to do it by having fun.  And if the people I&#039;m surrounding myself with aren&#039;t fun, then I need to make a change.  My screenplay.  My life.  If I&#039;m in charge, then I need to step up and make the casting adjustment.  Again, thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another good post. When I originally came to Japan to study in 05 I enjoyed being thoroughly critical of pretty much everything. It didn&#039;t help that I couldn&#039;t properly understand the language and had basically no Japanese friends. Now I can&#039;t quite believe how nice a place it is and I have to keep pinching myself. OK, there&#039;s =still= too much plastic wrapping on everything... ^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes you say things that are really universally true, and you say it with uncertainty, which makes it even more true. odd.

Anyway keep up the good work :D

(Starting to be able to talk some japanese, and have gone through all the kanji once, revising them now :D, never would have gotten there without Khatzumoto.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed, but I&#039;m a realist and I don&#039;t like the idea of only looking on the bright side or only acknowledging those things which are positive, I want all the information, good and bad, THAT&#039;S the most useful thing to do.  Every culture and country has its problems, and Japan is no exception, so what I&#039;m saying is that the correct thing to do is acknowledge and accept both the positives and the negatives. 

Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is all very true. Unfortunately not many people are willing to face reality, the internet especially. Make a fair point and you&#039;ll be greeted by a youtube video showing negativity of a few; which will be based on Japan or anywhere else as a whole.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve met enough stupid and rude people in enough places to know that it&#039;s a worldwide phenomenon, but luckily it&#039;s not everyone or even most people.  I could complain about how much I hate Americans for being ignorant, condescending, whatever, but actually, most of the Americans I know are people I like, and those labels don&#039;t really apply.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, it seems to me that people who are racist only base what they have personally seen from maybe one or two people of the race they hate. Even if they meet someone of the same race who is completely the opposite they completely ignore it :/ But one race of people isn&#039;t really all one way. Sure there are things people in other countries do that we don&#039;t, but past that, there are people who are mean in every single country. There are people who are stupid, there are people who are racist, there are people who are way too nice for their own good. No one country has a certain type of person in which every person in that country demonstrates. And it&#039;s stupid to think otherwise.

Basically, no matter where you go, there are going to be people who you don&#039;t like. But there will also be people you do like. You just have to find them :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I spent a year in Japan 24 years ago, teaching English in a little church. When I had friends, I loved Japan. When I felt lonely, it seemed an indifferent, if not hostile place. Of course, the people didn&#039;t change, my perception did. That was helpful to remember.

And there&#039;s nothing wrong with loving language for it&#039;s own sake, though I would say we miss out (I include myself) when we don&#039;t enjoy people and culture along the way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! :D

I think that most people aren&#039;t learning Japanese for the sake of learning Japanese; I think that they&#039;re working on a larger &quot;Japan Project&quot; where the language is only one aspect. I&#039;d like to see more posts like this to help with my own Japan Project. :)]]></description>
