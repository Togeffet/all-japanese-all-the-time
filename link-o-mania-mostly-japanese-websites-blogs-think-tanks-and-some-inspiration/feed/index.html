					<description><![CDATA[The whole site is good for reading practice, and has all sorts of japanese kids learning games. A LOT of katakana and hirigana, not a lot of kanji The link has a typing game for either kana or romaji, your pick. It also tests a little low level kanji just in site navigation. Overall pretty cool if you have no problems using a kids site&#062;w&#060;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Mallory
I would think so. Very often blogs are written in a spoken, informal style so they can be a very good source for natural sounding sentences. 
Another source I&#039;ve found recently is

http://komachi.yomiuri.co.jp/

It&#039;s like an agony aunt site. People write posts about problems they&#039;re having in their life and others respond with advice. It&#039;s great as a source of Japanese as it&#039;s used in normal daily life]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto-

    Love the site, and can&#039;t thank you enough for all your awesome insight. It&#039;s really changed my life and helped get my Japanese to a whole new level.

    Anyways, I&#039;ve moved my blog from wordpress to blogger, and wanted to let you know that some of the links have changed.


    &quot;Limiting beliefs&quot; link is now found at http://emergencynampa.blogspot.com/2008/09/i-not-asian-limiting-beliefs-about_13.html
    &quot;positive beliefs&quot; link is now found at http://emergencynampa.blogspot.com/2008/09/destiny-beliefs-that-will-help-you_17.html
    &quot;learning kanji&quot; link is now found at http://emergencynampa.blogspot.com/2008/09/master-japanese-writing-system-in-2_28.html

    When you get a chance, please change your links so there&#039;s no dead ones and keep up the good work!

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve visited http://www.iknow.co.jp too! In the short time I used it, I think I learned more words in comparison to studying in other ways. It&#039;s great! 

I have a question for you: Do you think it&#039;s bad to learn another foreign language at the same time as Japanese? (Or just learning multiple foreign languages simultaneously in general.)

I&#039;ve also taken up learning Korean in addition to learning Japanese. Korean grammar is similar to Japanese grammar, so I often compare the uses. Some things I remember in Korean because I can relate to them in Japanese. I think, oh that&#039;s like this! But I also remember certain things because they are DIFFERENT from Japanese. In a sense when speaking Korean, I will sometimes think of &quot;what would I say in Japanese?&quot; instead of thinking of my native English. XD I don&#039;t know if this is a good or bad thing though hahaha. 

Up until recently, I wasn&#039;t able to write a very long paragraph in Japanese. But just the other day I was able to sit down and write out a rather long blog entry in Japanese(4 paragraphs or so). When I had finished I was surprised by how much I had written, without thinking too much and without using a dictionary! 

So I wonder, could learning another foreign language be helping my Japanese!? And in a sense, I wonder, are they both helping me learn the other?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Forgot to mention-

The &quot;hate comments&quot; and all that other jazz you get are just natural indicators of your success. I delete copious amounts of negativity on my blog as well from people who don&#039;t get what I do. It used to bug me, but now I just shake my head and realize that I&#039;m doing what I love, nothing else matters.

That&#039;s when you know you have succeeded. No one has done anything great without facing plenty of opposition. As my wing often says: &quot;Let the losers talk the bullshit.&quot;

Thanks for linking my site. It&#039;s an honor to have one of my posts linked by you and heralded as great, inspirational posts. I have to say that your blog is one of the best and most inspirational sites I&#039;ve ever encountered. I hope that I can have the same influence over people, just in a slightly different arena.

Keep up the awesome work and I&#039;ll see you in Japan!
