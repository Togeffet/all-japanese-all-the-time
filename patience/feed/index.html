					<description><![CDATA[Sup Khatz.  I just came across your blog a couple weeks ago.  For years, I thought
I was crazy. Working two jobs, 7 days a week, and still found time to become
near-native fluent in Spanish in under 2 years (reading, writing, speaking.)  

To all doubters, this man&#039;s &quot;technique&quot; (if you wanna call it that) works.  As 
native English speakers, we&#039;re conditioned to think of language as something to
attack: &quot;I wanna DOMINATE (target language.)&quot;  &quot;I wanna MASTER (target language.)&quot;
Learning a language is not a war, it is an experience.  Fall in love with the
culture, and the language will be seeping from your pores.

Thank you Khatz.  You&#039;ve proven I&#039;m not crazy for wrapping myself in Spanish to the
point of being called &quot;Blaxican&quot; by everyone I knew.

Peace.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Neither Clannad nor Air have been translated, so you&#039;re getting the raw Japanese product from J-List. You used to be able to go to Himeya Shop for &#039;em, but that&#039;s dead now, so alas. Search out Paletweb, Getchu and DLsite if you want to go a deeper. Amazon won&#039;t help you ever because they can&#039;t ship software overseas =(

For console galge, it&#039;s all about PSN. Grab a PSP/PS3 and a Japanese PSN account and buy all the datas you want. Similarly, for hard copies, PlayAsia has you covered.

Hope that helps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Today I changed my iPhone Operating System language to Japanese after encountering that suggestion about a dozen times on this blog. You beat me down with patience and persistence!  Thanks!

Really it&#039;s not so bad.  I recognize the icons, which helps, and I&#039;ve been learning the ONYOMI using the &quot;movie method&quot; (associate all similar sounding onyomi to scenes from a particular film), so it&#039;s not a huge step for an intermediate learner wading through the kanji-rich environs of the iphone OS.

Oh, and Khatz, thanks for your post on &quot;getting used to Japanese&quot; vs. &quot;Learning Japanese&quot;.  That was very helpful for me in seeing immersion as attainable and non-threatening.

Finally, my wife, who has zero interest in Japanese, still loves some of the learning concepts I&#039;ve passed onto her from your blog.  Keep it up. (we don&#039;t have time to read all those books you read!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How about: Patience is not letting Japanese audio justify English text..?

It&#039;s a bit of an issue I&#039;ve been having... Whenever I notice I&#039;m reading English that I don&#039;t need to be reading, I&#039;ll stop, but in the process make a vacuum.. I need to find a good resource of simple Japanese to read... -_-&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dude, your awesome!

I remember reading your blog a few years back, and thought it was some crazy idea .

And now, I&#039;m almost there... almost fluent...

I can listen and watch Japanese drama and understand about 80% of whats being said.  Now I&#039;m just learning and remembering kanji.

It&#039;s a great feeling, because I was listening to Tohoshinki song that was in One Piece, and actually understood part of the chorus, which said &quot;If it rains, I&#039;ll be your umbrella, If its a strong wind, I&#039;ll be your wall&quot;... and I was like dam son thats so poetic.... 

Mind you I&#039;ve been listening to this song for more than a hundred times....

Now I just gotta get literate, btw, Khatz, you know where I can buy japanese galge ? Clannad or Air?  Jlist has it but I think their&#039;s is all translated....]]></description>
