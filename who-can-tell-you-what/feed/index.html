					<description><![CDATA[To tie another one of your posts to strength training, this reminds me of a little internet community centered around gym-owner/author Mark Rippetoe.  The guy wrote a book called Starting Strength that has in-depth descriptions of proper form for a few basic exercises, and outlines a beginner strength training program.

The program starts out pretty easy, but a couple of months in and it gets pretty tough.  This causes people to give up, log on to his forums and complain that the program doesn&#039;t work.  It&#039;s a fascinating phenomenon.  These people can&#039;t stick with something, so instead they make an effort to make sure that other people avoid an incredibly effective method.  I should add that the problems these people have are overwhelmingly self-created.  Lack of proper food intake, lack of rest, skipping workouts, etc.

It&#039;s actually very interesting, AJATT can be tied to strength training in many ways.  I had been thinking about your frequency concept and its relation to Pavel&#039;s &quot;greasing the groove&quot; for a while before that guest post popped up.]]></description>
