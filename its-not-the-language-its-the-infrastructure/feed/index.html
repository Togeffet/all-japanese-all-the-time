					<description><![CDATA[&#062;When we AJATTeers start off learning a language, we’re basically starting a business.  We make the necessary connections to suppliers and form relationships with clients, and then from there it’s all a matter of making sure everything is where it needs to be, when it needs to be.
 
Greatest. Explanation. Ever. :O]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Infrastructure and logistics.  Logistics is the most important part, though.  Infrastructure doesn&#039;t matter unless its where you need it, when you want it there, i.e. the fact that there are plentiful and excellent Japanese dictionaries means nothing unless you have a convenient interface and habit to access them from.  The fact that Japan produces more anime than any other country (kind of a given really, but...bear with me)  doesn&#039;t mean squat unless ones that trigger your interest are moved into your awareness and in front of your face at just the right moments.  When we AJATTeers start off learning a language, we&#039;re basically starting a business.  We make the necessary connections to suppliers and form relationships with clients, and then from there it&#039;s all a matter of making sure everything is where it needs to be, when it needs to be.  That&#039;s what requires the effort.  Everything else is a side-effect.  I&#039;m sure the logistics metaphor will break down somewhere, but I haven&#039;t found it yet.  haha]]></description>
