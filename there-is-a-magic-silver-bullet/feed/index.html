					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t exactly say that sticking with a bad tool is better than using no tool at all. If anything, it can set you back further, entrenching you in some really bad habits and making it harder for the good tools to work their way into your mind. That&#039;s exactly the problem I face now with my Japanese: I&#039;m interpreting it all in English, and it&#039;s a clumsy, highly inefficient process. In the past, I&#039;ve tried out methods that should cure me of this by revealing to my mind just how useless it is, but my mind held on, understanding be damned.

I am still searching for the magic silver bullet that will lead me away from this, and while continual questioning has led me to more refined questions that get to the heart of what&#039;s wrong with my Japanese understanding, they haven&#039;t resulted in any worthwhile answers.]]></description>
