					<description><![CDATA[@Ryder

The ない  has no special meaning as far as I know. It&#039;s just the second half of 危ない. There is no implied だ because 危ない  by itself can fuction as the end of a sentence, as with most adjectives that end with い　（some adjectives that end in い、though, do need a だ as they are a different type of adjective altogether, like きれい、きらい、or とくい）

That probably makes it as clear as mud, but basically, 危ない　functions as the end of sentence: nothing is implied at all. だ　is only required when there is a noun-phrase or a なーadjective (like those above) at the end of the sentence. 

I hope that helps a little bit. Sorry if I&#039;ve just confused you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Consider yourself flogged... :)

Actually, I don&#039;t mind the notes. I get some value out of those tidbits of information that can explain a word&#039;s role in a sentence. It might go against your original theory but for some people it might be quite helpful.

					<description><![CDATA[ddddave, thank you so much for the correction (it&#039;s corrected now). I really should be taken out and flogged, but you have chosen kinder methods :). Perhaps it would be best to write less commentary with the sentences, that way there&#039;s fewer room for error; it&#039;s very important that these things be correct. Any suggestions?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Q: 日本語を勉強して来ました
...
来る（くる） by itself means “to come”, but it’s often used as an auxiliary verb (so it’s “helping” the verb 渡る（わたる)

Isn&#039;t it helping する?]]></description>
