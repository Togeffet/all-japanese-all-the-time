					<description><![CDATA[The price has gone up considerably and it is quite costly seeming as I will be starting university very soon. However I&#039;m planning to use the left over bursary and loan to purchase this as its better than spending Â£3250 give or take on just a japanese degree alone. Also i think Â£1 or Â£2 a day is quite a fair price considering most people spend more than than on coffea/starbucks everyday and overspend on food at uni. Hopefully this will be worth it though seeming as i tend to binge and purge on ajatt stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you even think you can&#039;t afford it then SilverSpoon is not for you. Â Remember in addition to the monthly cost you are expected to be able to spend at LEAST and additional $150 on Japanese media.

Once you are at the point where you are considering spending thousands of dollars to take Japanese language classes then you are in the market for SilverSpoon.

					<description><![CDATA[Do you folks really buy $1500 products sight-unseen?  

I fully support Khatz&#039;s efforts to monetize a site that he has undoubtedly spent hours and hours in time and energy putting together.  I have derived benefits from this site, and I bought some earlier products as a type of donation almost to pay back a little for a great site.  But my guess is that this concept is merely a couple of databases accessed by an auto-email computer script.  I can&#039;t see spending $1500 for that type of thing.

But I guess enough folks are paying, since there have been several rounds so far.  Maybe Khatz has a second career in marketing! ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure even at these prices people will still be interested. Â What Khatzu-san is doing is using the price and no-refund-until-the-end policy to weed out people who aren&#039;t serious and who don&#039;t really have the money. Â (For example, if somebody just signed up to test it out for a few days then stops paying because they don&#039;t have much money to spend. Â That was me. Â He told me many times that SilverSpoon wasn&#039;t for me. Â But I just didn&#039;t listen. Â I wanted to be part of the cool new club. Â Then I had to listen. No point in continuing if I&#039;m just gonna be shortchanging myself the whole way. lol) Similarly, the constantly raising prices create a &quot;don&#039;t wait start now hurry up get in the choppa&quot; mentality. Â Thus, the SilverSpoon pricing seems to be reflecting some of the principles he talks about here on regular &#039;JATT. Â Or maybe I&#039;m reading too much into it. Â Anywho, it&#039;s still not that much money anyway. Â Tons cheaper than a new laptop.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just looked back - even round 6 pricing was reasonable. It was $60/mo on the monthly plan back then, and I would&#039;ve paid the full, one time price back then as well. I hope you&#039;re paying attention to your revenue curve, Khatz, because I just don&#039;t see how you could be making nearly the same kind of sales at these prices.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Le sigh, I&#039;m with your there. I was finally ready to pull the trigger when I saw the other day that a new round was opening soon (now), but now even the monthly price is completely off the hook. I&#039;d sooner buy a car for $150+ per month, and since that isn&#039;t happening, and the price of Silver Spoon continues to rise with each round, it looks like it&#039;ll never happen.

I&#039;ll just keep floundering in my studies for free.Â ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Aww. Â I&#039;m very interested in AJATT Silver Spoon but have been unable to grab it. Â Now, at the end of September, I&#039;ll finally be able to be in a position to fully commit to the program, but I&#039;m a bit confused about the price continuing to rise. Â I have been a bit out of the loop but I seem remember when it was little more than $600. Â Now it&#039;s over $1500 for the full package? Â Correct me if I am completely wrong and this price change isn&#039;t correct- my memory may be a bit fuzzy. Â Maybe I was looking forward to getting that steal of a price!! Â Still a pretty good overall deal- but a lot to throw down initially and definitely the preferable method than paying 2x the amount for the monthly payments..


Regardless, I can&#039;t wait to finally try SilverSpoon, I think it&#039;ll still be worth the entrance fee despite it rising! Â Thanks Khatzumoto for supplying this service.. Hopefully I&#039;ll get in before it REALLY costs me :P. Cheers!]]></description>
