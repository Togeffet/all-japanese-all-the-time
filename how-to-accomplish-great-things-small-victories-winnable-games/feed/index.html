					<description><![CDATA[Hello Khazumoto,

although it&#039;s the first lesson, yesterday I finished your free course made of 101 lessons. That&#039;s a great stuff indeed.

Unfortunately there are two errors in this course.

It happened twice that I got two the same lessons instead of a new one. 

First such a lesson was 90. It was not a new lesson but it was lesson 89.

Second time it was a lesson 97. It was not a new lesson but it was the previous one, 96.

So I want to ask you for sending me two links to the proper lessons, 90 and 97! Is it possible?

					<description><![CDATA[Great post and interesting thoughts. The use of games or game-like abilities when doing &quot;real stuff&quot; is a huge interest of mine. :)

Are you familiar with Jane McGonigal and her &quot;Reality is Broken&quot;? She&#039;s a director at Institute for the Future and is specialised in the usage of games in this way, to become better, more effective or to overcome certain problems. I really recommend the book (I do think you&#039;ll like it, considering the post above :) ).

I wrote a short post about her thoughts here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://better-reality-games.com/the-reality-is-broken-and-how-i-took-mine-to-service-it-is-not-quite-finished-yet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://better-reality-games.com/the-reality-is-broken-and-how-i-took-mine-to-service-it-is-not-quite-finished-yet/

&lt;/a&gt;And she held a TED lecture about how gaming can make the world a better place: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world.html

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great post and interesting thoughts. The use of games or game-like abilities when doing &#8220;real stuff&#8221; is a huge interest of mine. 🙂</p>
<p>Are you familiar with Jane McGonigal and her &#8220;Reality is Broken&#8221;? She&#8217;s a director at Institute for the Future and is specialised in the usage of games in this way, to become better, more effective or to overcome certain problems. I really recommend the book (I do think you&#8217;ll like it, considering the post above 🙂 ).</p>
