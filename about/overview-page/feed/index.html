					<description><![CDATA[This may come off strange, but when I discovered this site..man...I actually felt something in my chest. I guess it was excitement or maybe relief but damn, talk about mind blowing. Ive been attacking my studies in a very structured way and by studying the balls of the rules of Japanese, I&#039;ve gotten pretty damn far, but I have the dry spells when I dont speak, and its not as crazy sexy cool as it once was and I guess i get rusty because the rules are just fine, but the actual usage gathers dust on the shelf. Now I think I think I;ve found what I need to get to the next level. I&#039;m goin hard from now. Im going Jake Sulley style native...letting my body do the work and just f-ing around with it. I&#039;ve evacuated the notion of impressing people and now Im just gonna get back to having fun. I guess the short of it is that Im thankful for the site becuase it legitamely saved my life as a l2 learner. The biggest of ups to Khatz.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are shared decks on anki that follow the order of RTK and some have stories in them. If you don&#039;t like the stories of particular cards you can always change them.
The one I personally used was the Lazy Kanji Mod V2 by Kendo. 
The lazy book-free method. ^^  I&#039;ll admit, it would probably be better if you came up with your own stories and made them as memorable as possible, and that I had to change a few of the stories to work for me, but I found it to be pretty decent overall.]]></description>
