But good point - stop making excuses and let&#039;s see what some persistent, consistent and clever work can do for us. The unworked genetics of MJ alone would not have taken him to the NBA. Just as hardworking lesser genetics would not have taken him to superstardom.  ;)]]></description>

That said, I&#039;m always amazed at how both my (fairly small children) have many of the same mannerisms and habits that my wife and I did as children, so there has to be something in the old genetic coding somewhere.]]></description>
