					<description><![CDATA[素晴らしいですね！！

本当に、Ａｊａｔｔさんに、こんな思考で英語を学ぶことを考えたこともなく、子供たちに暗記と文法とテストを
おしつける日本のおえらい英語学者の先生方にこういうことを話して欲しいです。。。

I really love this post.
Especially this part, &quot;You work with the fact that the Earth is round even though it looks flat.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This one is kind of like the &quot;kill your heroes&quot; post and is kinda like the job-ability system of Final Fantasy V, and is probably one of the most insightful things I&#039;ve ever read on language learning, and seems to almost sum up what you want us to do:

&quot;The question then is (as ever): how does this apply to the learning of a second language? How does one ‘populate the words of others with one’s own intentions’?  Eva Hoffman (1998: 220), a Polish teenager learning English in the United States, describes the process of appropriation:  ‘Since I lack a voice of my own, the voices of others invade me… By assuming them, I gradually make them mine. I am being remade, fragment by fragment, like a patchwork quilt’.  In a similar, patchwork fashion, a student of academic writing will selectively imitate (or copy) features, both micro- and macro-, of a model text as a first step in discovering her own academic ‘voice’.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Other researchers have documented similar differences in the way specific cultures realise particular genres. For example, Celce-Murcia and Olshtain (2000: 149) cite research that shows that Japanese expository writing ‘has a number of rhetorical organisational patterns that are quite different from those found in English expository writing.  In some of these patterns, the main theme is not foregrounded as it is in English but rather hinted at’.  They add, ‘English teachers may view English essays written according to one of the Japanese organisational patterns as lacking in coherence and unity, and thus rate them lower than essays written with English organisational patterns’.&quot;

http://scottthornbury.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/o-is-for-othering/

No idea how they conclude this for Japanese.  I&#039;ve read a lot of things in Japanese, and I&#039;ve never gotten this impression, yet I seem to understand it OK.  Maybe I&#039;m just oblivious to it, or maybe I&#039;m just used to it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great paradox right there!
In the end it&#039;s all about where your attention wanders...let it wander on your target language long enough to start getting results, and pull it away from that whiny mental voice complaining about not being there yet.
Awesome little post as Khatz!]]></description>
