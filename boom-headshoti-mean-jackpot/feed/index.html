					<description><![CDATA[＠saleem
The thing is, it seems to me, a lot of people in Japan actually *buy* that kind of stuff (シナリオ本) is the thing. It feels like Japanese consumers are pretty 素直/&lt;em&gt;sunao&lt;/em&gt; that way, like, try googoling for pictures of Japanese celebrities -- they&#039;re few and far between, because people actually go out and buy 写真集).

With that piece of discouragement, I would like to add DO NOT despair. Try eugoogoling
脚本、シナリオ、try links on DramaNote. Also try googling actual lines of dialog: unique ones of course.

Hope that helps...

And another thing -- better get to scanning those manuals!]]></description>

Thanks! This is awesome! I&#039;ve downloaded the first 10 to start listening to. I wonder if it&#039;d be legal to download all of them, fire up Word, cut and paste all their scripts in one document and then bundle everything together in a zip file. If so I&#039;m game to do the grunt work if it would be hosted (khatzu??). Their site says:

&quot;★★All materials are provided for study purpose only!★★
If you want to use them for other purposes, please let us know!
Then you can quote them, remake them, eat them,,,,?!?&quot;

It would be for our study purposes after all.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the links! This is the first comment I&#039;ve left but I&#039;ve been reading this site for about 6 months or so and it has helped my study tremendously, both in terms of motivation to study more efficiently, as well as providing inspiration for new methods I probably wouldn&#039;t have thought of otherwise. So - thank you!

Anyway, I stumbled across this podcast that I&#039;ve found quite useful, and probably others will too - the address is http://www.voiceblog.jp/japaneselistening - unfortunately it looks like it&#039;s not being updated any more, but there&#039;s more than 30 entries there that you can still download. It&#039;s made by a couple of  guys in Tokyo who just record their daily conversations (talking about things as varied as games consoles, aeroplanes, even love hotels!), but the kicker is that they transcribe everything word-for-word, even including in the さ…何か…　etc. The site address for the scripts is http://japaneselistening.blogspot.com

Thanks again, looking forward to your next post!

Cheers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz-sensei,
Great post again. Just on this, got to thinking to ask if you know or have any good game walkthrough sites, like gamefaqs.com. The type that break it down by console, and game, and have different kinds of walkthroughs, like some with narrative, some with just the actual scripts. Could be really useful reading practice, especially if one has played the game already and has an idea of whats going on.

Btw, big fan of your blog and motivation. Khatz-sensei=Machine!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, good find. Maybe I&#039;ll bust out the scanner and post some Super Smash Brother&#039;s pages, if folks are interested...  

You&#039;re good at Googling stuff, got a question for you :)  Do you have any tips on finding drama scripts online? I know you posted links to タイガー＆ドラゴン　 from dramanote.seesaa.net, and that was great. I&#039;ve been looking around for 木更津キャッツアイ (seen it? it&#039;s also written by Kudo Kankuro, dang good). Also the more mainstream 踊る大捜査線 ...

I&#039;m probably making some extremely silly mistake in Googling, because I feel like some fan has got to have posted a script. If you could teach me how to fish on that one I&#039;d be grateful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading materials are always welcome, so thanks a lot!

As a side note, by cousin has a Wii and it got instruction manuals in Japanese, with furigana also :). Like how to use the Wiimote properly so you don&#039;t accidentally throw it to people around :).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this, Khatzu.

Looking forward to the links blog post - should be very interesting.

BTW - liked your post about the jobs forum too - it&#039;s nice to see a bit of detail around the &#039;How I did it&#039;. At the moment, we have the essentials (phases 0-4), but it is great to hear some of the nitty-gritty - the angst and so on of your journey to Japanese fluency nirvana (I can definitely relate to some angst!!).

Cheers,
