					<description><![CDATA[&gt;the same level of difficulty to me, but the way that SM scheduled for next repetition varied from 26th December 2007 to 1st March 2008! Surely there is something wrong here?

KhatzuMemo takes both the present score and overall track record (cumulative score, mean score, lapse rate) of an item into account, along with some other variables. The track record essentially provides an index of how &quot;difficult&quot; and item has been for you over time. So, yes, even with the same rating of immediate &quot;difficulty&quot; (i.e. present score), the interval can vary widely (from 0-day to a few days to weeks and months) based on the track record (overall &quot;difficulty&quot;) of the item. 

In this sense, KhatzuMemo and SuperMemo share similar behavior (I would bet all SRSes do, in this sense)  and I don&#039;t think what SuperMemo does is wrong, assuming overall track record is being taken into account.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz
 
I want to switch from SuperMemo to KhatzuMemo - I should have listened to you in the first place - SM is a pain in the proverbial! 
 
I have been putting this off for some time now because what I read from other users of SM is that it is virtually impossible to do without losing data but I guess I have to bite the bullet at some point.
 
Is there any easy way to do this and how much am I likely to lose on switching? Do you have any instructions anywhere? Sorry if this has been asked previously. 
 
Also, a question with regard to how your program works in relation to SM - I was doing some repetitions last night when i noticed something very strange - I graded four cards as &#039;PASS&#039; i.e. the same level of difficulty to me, but the way that SM scheduled for next repetition varied from 26th December 2007 to 1st March 2008! Surely there is something wrong here? 
 
I vaguely remember reading somewhere that SM analyses the content of cards and allocates its own difficulty ranking and will take that into account when scheduling dates for next review but a differential of 3 months for four cards that were each graded &#039;PASS&#039; doesn&#039;t seem right to me. Also 50% of my data in Japanese so I don&#039;t know how SM would analyse the difficult content of that?! 
 
Sorry if these are stupid questions but I just wandered if this is right or not and will I experience the same thing using KhatzuMemo?
 
Thanks

I certainly do! User interface stuff is kind of taking a backseat to adding features (at this point), but I do intend to add a Japanese version. The cool thing about kanji is they take up less space as well...more information per pixel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Prom
Thanks for pointing that out (error display).

As for the cellphone display problem...I&#039;m shelving it as a &quot;known issue&quot; temporarily (tried all KINDS of stuff and it only seemed to make it worse), but I&#039;d definitely like to come back to it. Don&#039;t worry, I won&#039;t leave you and other people hanging! :( :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, when editing an once deleted and then restored item, I always get the error message that editing failed. But in fact, the database was updated. 
So there&#039;s just the problem that an error message is displayed when it shouldn&#039;t.

And... what about the cell phone display problem? ;-) (sorry)

QUESTION: keyword + story
ANSWER: kanji

For RTK reps, I think it&#039;s crucial that you are able to actively recall the kanji, i.e. write them from memory. It&#039;s OK to give yourself both the keyword and the story, but the kanji needs to come out of your head, through your pen and onto some paper or something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[-Dramatic cry of Joy-

Thanks a lot for the updates to Khatzumemo. 

By the way, since this is your most recent post, and you are most likely to check comments here, I have a question. When you are learning Kanji, do you have to put the English keyword/Story in the question field of your SRS, and the Japanese Kanji in the answer, or do you put the Kanji in the question and English in the Answer. Does it really matter which way you go, when studying Kanji?]]></description>
