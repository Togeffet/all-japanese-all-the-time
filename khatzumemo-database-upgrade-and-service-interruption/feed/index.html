					<description><![CDATA[This is totally off topic, but I&#039;m pulling my hair out trying to figure it out. I also don&#039;t know if it&#039;s kosher to answer in this forums, so apologies if I&#039;m going against rules of the site.

Can anyone point me towards a site which would contain movies from a company the begins with a &quot;d&quot; and ends with &quot;isney&quot;, to download a.k.a. Torrent sites or the like?

Spongebob or any other american cartoons dubbed would help too.

Specifically American cartoons as I&#039;ve seen most already. I could build an enviroment around me with these films.

I&#039;m am too cheap and don&#039;t have money. Help?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz!
I&#039;ve been reading your blog for a while now and find it very inspirational. I like your method of learning languages a lot.
The last time you have posted something new on your blog was almost 10 days ago or so, so I was wondering...you know...I need my daily dose of alljapaneseallthetime :D

Regards,
Ilhan]]></description>
