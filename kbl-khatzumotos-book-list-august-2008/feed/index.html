					<description><![CDATA[For cheap books to the US, I prefer www.bk1.jp, because they have semi-sane shipping rates, and a point club. You can choose from EMS, Air, SAL, and Ground. (And there&#039;s an in-Japan shipping option as well that&#039;s pretty cheap.) No handling fees, either. And it even meets the AJATT requirement of being ruthlessly Japanese-- there be no English on this site!

Manga-wise, I like „Éè„É§„ÉÜ„ÅÆ„Åî„Å®„Åè because it&#039;s a pretty easy read, furigana and all, and I also like the manga version of „ÉÜ„É¨„Éë„Ç∑„ÉºÂ∞ëÂ•≥Ëò≠, because it also abounds with furigana, and doesn&#039;t force me to hit the dictionary 10 times per sentence. I&#039;d wager that the „ÉÜ„É¨„Éë„Ç∑„ÉºÂ∞ëÂ•≥Ëò≠ novels are also a pretty easy read, since they&#039;re also aimed at ~6Âπ¥ reading level, but I haven&#039;t had a chance to get them yet.

I&#039;d say they&#039;re both good for ~ JLPT level 3+. So if you could nail level 3, but not quite get level 2, these should be somewhat easy to read-- you&#039;ll still have to look a lot of stuff up, but it won&#039;t drag your reading speed down.

My preferences for reading involve books that I can read with some looking-up of stuff, but not constant looking-up of stuff. There&#039;s that fine line between reading for fun and making work out of fun, you know?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i&quot;d have to say „Éá„Çπ„Éª„Éé„Éº„Éà„ÄÄis a really well thought out manga series too. The anime is great for around the first 23 episodes, and follows the manga dialogue closely, with some reordering of events, but is a bit messy after that. 

The Ê∂ºÂÆÆ„Éè„É´„Éí light novel series is not bad either; light novels IMO are the easiest step to reading after you find reading manga comfortable. Áãº„Å®È¶ôËæõÊñô is good too. 

I like ÊôÇ„Çí„Åã„Åë„ÇãÂ∞ëÂ•≥ too; it isn&#039;t really a light novel, it&#039;s a kid&#039;s novel really. It&#039;s  easy to read and not too boring, though I prefer the adapted anime.]]></description>

For anyone looking for a full-length novel entirely with furigana, check out Â∞ëÂπ¥H. Even if your Kanji is good, it&#039;s good to make sure you don&#039;t permanently burn any mis-readings into your brain. Furigana is on the first instance of a word on a page, but further instances don&#039;t have it‚Äîso you still gotta remember. Fair warning though: all dialogs are in dialect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Vgambit - are you in the US? If so, I can recommend using this site:

http://www.fujisan.com/

Their book selection is impressive and the prices/shipping are reasonable. I bought three books from them recently and it only cost me around $35 including shipping. The only down side to them is they only ship within the United States and the shipping time is somewhat slow (my order took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive). But overall I was very satisfied.

To Khatzumoto&#039;s credit, posting alternative links for every book would be very time consuming, plus, as I&#039;m sure the readers of this site are spread around the world, any alternative link posted may or may not be applicable depending on shipping policies.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vgambit &#8211; are you in the US? If so, I can recommend using this site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fujisan.com/" class="autohyperlink">www.fujisan.com/</a></p>
<p>Their book selection is impressive and the prices/shipping are reasonable. I bought three books from them recently and it only cost me around $35 including shipping. The only down side to them is they only ship within the United States and the shipping time is somewhat slow (my order took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive). But overall I was very satisfied.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the links to Amazon.co.jp, but for people outside of Japan, it&#039;s generally the most expensive place to get books from. You should post alternative purchase links for people who still live elsewhere.

I mean, I&#039;m all for buying through your referral links, but not if I have to pay 5 times the normal rate for shipping.]]></description>
