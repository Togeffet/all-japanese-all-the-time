					<description><![CDATA[Giving traits &quot;x,y,z&quot; any merit is in of itself an opinion. All it really boils down to is if the viewer enjoyed the show. You can&#039;t argue &quot;show x is better than show y because it had element z in it&quot;. The argument falls flat because the traits you give value  might not mean anything at all to someone else. In summation SAO might have a more engaging story, better visuals, acting, whatever but that doesn&#039;t devalue other peoples shows or opinions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couple points.
First: SAO is in Japanese.  The OP indicated that they were watching SAO in order to improve their Japanese ability.  You seem to be expressing disgust that someone finds value in a literary work which you consider to be unsophisticated.  The purpose of this website is to provide advice and encouragement to learners of Japanese and other languages.  The purpose of this website is not literary criticism.  You&#039;re starting the wrong argument in the wrong forum.

Second: You&#039;re trying to measure subjective qualities (enjoyability; artistic merit) in terms of objective qualities (logical consistency within a story).  I just don&#039;t see that as an appropriate argument.  I&#039;ll agree that SAO is a horrific mess from an academic standpoint, but I watch it and enjoy it anyway.  The visuals are good, and the setting is interesting even if the story is &quot;objectively&quot; bad.  My interpretation is that the setting is what the author was focused on to begin with.  The characters and conflict are just mechanisms by which to explore the setting in greater detail.  A stronger story probably could have improved the overall quality of the series;  It might also have pulled the audience&#039;s attention away from the setting and onto the characters, which may not have been what the author wanted.  The point is that there&#039;s no objectively right way to entertain people.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[False. A show containing or not containing Traits X, Y, Z isn&#039;t not my opinion. This is the core aspect of the discussion; the other things were fluff.

Fact: Sword Art Online has a significant amount of cliches going by the standard general English definition.

Fact: Sword Art Online has numerous plot holes given the standard English definitions.

Fact: Your post has several instances of back-pedaling.

As for the rest I&#039;ve already addressed it; comments like &quot;D class&quot; logically follow this, however the factual part is existence or lack of existence of traits X, Y, and Z. I&#039;m objectively right, and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.
