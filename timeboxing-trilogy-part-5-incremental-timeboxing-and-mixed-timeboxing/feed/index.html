					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, have you ever needed to use any of these productivity hacks for your computer science studies? If not, what is the difference between studying Japanese and studying for a  career related field beside the fact that a career related field has money as the extrinsic motivation while language has fun which needs to remain intact? If I just answered my own question feel free to tell me that as well. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of weight-burning schedules of a treadmill.  One minute rest, two minutes running uphill, one minute rest, two minutes running uphill at a steeper slope, etc.  They are designed to aid weight loss, but they also reduce boredom of the exercise, so more gets done and satisfaction is higher compared to straight running for N minutes.  

Another interesting thing is how workouts get organized.  There&#039;s usually a balance between too little change, which is doing the same exercises for long periods of time, and too much change.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the double post, but I wanted to share some ソフト!! (software time yay!)

Like I mentioned, my iPod touch has a timer, but you have to program it each time. Besides, I&#039;m the type of OCD person that likes to see the album artwork while listening to her music ;)

So I set out to search for a timer for my Mac… and I stumbled upon 発表タイマー at the Apple Japan website.
I don&#039;t entirely understand, but you can set up to five timers at a time.
When you Save Settings and Start, all timers start at the same time.

Figured it might be useful to some of you guys, so here&#039;s the dmg file link.: http://www.tuat.ac.jp/CenterStaff/Sakura/software/tuatimer/TUATimer-Release1-1.dmg
Mac OS X only.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting about timeboxing…

I&#039;m a middle school student, just finished first year. Of course, suddenly I found myself with tons more homework and projects ;) (that, and I switched to a private school.) A lot of times I was waking up at 4AM just to finish homework that I had procrastinated on badly.

My solution? Timeboxing sheets!
I would plan ahead and, say, write &quot;代数学の宿題–5分 // 休み–2分 // 分学–10分&quot; and so on and so forth. I would set my iPod timer and work on limited periods of time, knowing that I probably wouldn&#039;t finish within them so I would add more. I became more focused all the time since I was switching activities constantly… and homework actually became a bit fun since it was a bit of a &quot;beat-the-clock&quot; game now.

Now, I&#039;m bad, but I really haven&#039;t been very good about using the SRS and reps and anything D:
My goal for today is to start RTK (for the third time) and really use the SRS more to help and all.
And I&#039;ll be sure to set my timeboxes!

Timeboxing is a great strategy, thank you very much (:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using incremental timeboxing, because for me, the hardest part of work is just getting it started, and getting it done with.  As anyone who listens to what Khatz has to say, just keep starting, and let the finishing take care of itself.  Also, the things we have to do and the things we need to do, if we get them out of the way, then we can just do the things we want to do.  So, with that in mind, I&#039;ve been attacking the things I have to or need to do, getting myself moving with incremental timeboxing, doing 1 minute at first.  It&#039;s funny though, I get going after 1 minute, and immediately start doing the 2 minute interval.  Whenever I see something else I want to do (even if it&#039;s something as simple as throwing away a paper cup, which you wouldn&#039;t normally think of as a &quot;reward&quot;) I wait until my current interval is done before I do that thing.  I&#039;ve also used rewards like taking a bite of a muffin I&#039;m having for breakfast as something to do between time intervals.

I actually rarely get past 5, and definitely not 10, before I forget to reset the timer and just work and work a whole bunch on the thing that I originally needed to use timeboxing just to get started.  If I stop working on it, and need to get going, I just start at 1 minute again.

The other thing I&#039;ve been doing, which isn&#039;t exactly related, was to start blocking out times that I would like to get things done in.  This give me a time when I &quot;should&quot; start working on something.  Of course, I rarely want to start working on it, thinking of other things to do instead.  But, I just start with a 1 minute timer, and just like that, I&#039;m moving on the project that I need to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oddly enough, I use the Mixed Timeboxing strategy when I&#039;m doing long-distance running (long-distance for me, that is.  You ultra-marathoners pipe down ;-) ).  I intersperse one-minute walking periods into running segments of gradually increasing, then decreasing, durations.  For example, maybe segments of 12, 15, 18, 15, 12, and 10 minutes.  Haven&#039;t tried it yet on SRS sessions, but I&#039;m definitely going to experiment with it.

It&#8217;s hard to break out of the assumption that work does not &#8211; and cannot &#8211; equal fun&#8230;</p>
