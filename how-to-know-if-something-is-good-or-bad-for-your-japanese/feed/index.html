					<description><![CDATA[Are people still asking this question? Wow, I mean, how can you learn languages if you don&#039;t USE the language?
Tell you what, I&#039;ve been brushing up on my French by reading the Smurfs. Some people would say it&#039;s not even real French--I disagree.

					<description><![CDATA[Are people seriously saying the whole &#039;you can&#039;t learn Japanese from anime&#039; again? I thought we&#039;ve been over this:
1. If learning from anime would make you incomprehensible to Japanese, the Japanese wouldn&#039;t be able to understand anime
2. People argue that anime isn&#039;t the way people really talk, which isn&#039;t true. The pronunciation is the same, it&#039;s the words they use. And trust me, a not stupid person isn&#039;t going to go around talking about giant robots or aliens in their normal sentences.
3. Every anime has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; &#039;everyday words/sentences&#039;. (&#039;Hello&#039;, &#039;Goodbye&#039;, etc.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know what you&#039;re saying: if anime is your only source of Japanese then you&#039;re probably not going to learn how to talk like a normal person, but this site is All Japanese All The Time. If a person is following the guidelines that Khatz has lain down, they couldn&#039;t possibly only be using anime as input. Anime is perfectly fine to watch sometimes. If you read Japanese books, listen to Japanese podcasts, and browse Japanese websites, I highly doubt watching anime will hurt you. You can think of anime as like dessert. Something to do after you&#039;ve had your fill of healthy salad Japanese. People who denounce anime seem to think you&#039;re going to be eating anime ice cream for every meal. Even if you deem anime not a genre worth sentence mining, and I won&#039;t say you&#039;re wrong, there are still definite advantages to watching it (with no English subs, of course): listening practice and comprehension, and reinforcing words and grammar you already know. 
I just don&#039;t get the anti-anime argument. I don&#039;t know of a person who seriously studies Japanese and at the same time ONLY watches anime. That person just doesn&#039;t exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Um, have you ever been around English speakers?  &#039;Cause that sounds pretty damn accurate to how we speak in relaxed, casual conversations.  Sure, I don&#039;t go around saying &quot;fuck you&quot; to my boss, but that is because I&#039;m not an *idiot* and I can recognize the appropriate context for different speech styles.  (I also don&#039;t talk to my friends with &quot;How do you do?&quot; or call them sir or ma&#039;am, because we&#039;re not on a formal footing.)
 
No one&#039;s saying &quot;you can/should/must learn *everything* from anime&quot;.  That doesn&#039;t work, any more than watching exclusively dramas or only listening to music, not speech.  (And frankly, there&#039;s so much other good media in Japanese, I dunno why anyone would *want* to limit themselves to anime.)  Fluency requires more than keigo; yes, it&#039;s nice to be polite, but you&#039;re not going to bother with clunky phrasing like 「・・・いたしませんか？」 when hitting on girls in a bar.  (Not to mention, overuse of keigo makes you sound like you&#039;ve got the world&#039;s largest stick up your 尻.)  Even if you don&#039;t use it personally, understanding slang and impolite language is pretty important -- and anime provides a nice first step.  (Because 声優 speak clearly, rather than mumbling like the average person; and once you learn a phrase, it&#039;s easier to recognize it mumbled.)
 
(And for what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve learned useful Japanese that I use on a daily basis... from playing エロゲー.  I don&#039;t think your argument holds water.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s some terrible advice.
Learning from anime is like learning English from R-rated movies.  Sure, it&#039;s &quot;real&quot; Japanese.  But conversely, you&#039;ll be saying &quot;damn&quot; or &quot;hell&quot; every other word if you learn sentence patterns from anime.

					<description><![CDATA[I hate when people speak bad about learning from anime. They are all like &quot;It is distinctively different from real spoken japanese!&quot; When in reality, it&#039;s just real japanese. Sure, you probably won&#039;t say お前をゲットしてやるぜ！ in a normal day, but you will say 
お前 
～～して
やる
