					<description><![CDATA[Yeah... this was something I needed to read. Especially with the RTK stuff. I was about to go through RTK for the third time but realized that it would be extremely inefficient. Thanks for confirming that Khatz :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[But I bet if you input like a hundred phrases each day like Katz- you would end up needing to delete some no brainer cards.
But personally I don&#039;t delete yet- I haven&#039;t got a thousand cards yet. When I do - I bet I&#039;ll start deleting some]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went through RTK 3 times, and I started from scratch each time. My reasoning being: &quot;It was so long ago, I&#039;ll never remember anything, and oh look how many reps I have to do&quot;. I expect this is one of the common reasons for &quot;kill em all, god will know his own&quot; deletion.

And the take home message of my last Japanese existential crisis was that it&#039;s complete bull.

You don&#039;t have to do all those reps at once, take a few weeks. By the end of that time, your SRS will be back to normal, and the cards you&#039;ve forgotten will have been rescheduled appropriately.

As an aside, the Anki guy should sell &quot;your SRS knows better than you&quot; T-shirts, mine certainly knows better than me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t feel that the issue is &quot;deletion&quot; or &quot;addition&quot;. It&#039;s all about discernment. At anyone time, I feel like I am either adding too much, or deleting too much. It&#039;s humanly impossible to know exactly what&#039;s right for your studies 100 percent of the time. You have to try your best to keep the oscillation between &quot;too much&quot; and &quot;too little&quot; as frequent but as least severe as possible so that if you take a step away from the graph it just looks like a straight line sitting on &quot;perfect&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Recall that even in the flood story arc in that rather famous book of Semitic legends, there was carry-over â€” a whole human family plus two of every animal, kept on board a ship until things died down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Two of every &lt;em&gt;unclean&lt;/em&gt; animal; the clean animals got fourteen saved each.

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;ve been guilty of this...I think since I&#039;ve started I&#039;ve gone through 3-4 non kanji decks. I kept feeling like I wanted to tweak my method or cards to make them easier / more fun so when a new &quot;version&quot; of my cards would be made the old one&#039;s just felt ...idk..gross. I should have probably kept the ones that I didn&#039;t have a problem with though. Still I don&#039;t feel like sifting through old decks I guess I&#039;ll just have to stop deleting decks.]]></description>
