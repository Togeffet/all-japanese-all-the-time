Tokyo Jihen, jazz/rock band fronted by Sheena Ringo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTKwzRAdY7w

School Food Punishment... I don&#039;t know how to describe it really... nice, not weird, just not very conducive to words: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_KHp6kbYXQ

					<description><![CDATA[A lot of Japanese music ( mostly J-pop ) really puts me off. However even before I started learning Japanese I found out about a couple bands, probably two of my favorite bands now. Boris ボリス is a great experimental band, they probably have something for everyone. From J-pop , noise, to sludge, they have a very diverse sound. Another great band is MONO 物(?), although sadly I don&#039;t think they have any tracks with vocals. That might hurt immersion a little bit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bump are my top recommendation.  Pop rock - upbeat stuff, sad love songs, melodic tunes.  The singer has a really beautiful, clear voice, and everything they do is well arranged.  The have a sense of humour, too, check out their bonus tracks! Funny stuff!
I recommend The Living Dead.  Imo best tune is  続.くだらない唄.  It&#039;s as the vocalist messes up halfway through and just shrugs it off and continues (on a live recording).  Good stuff!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a great fan of anything rock.

Alt Rock

The Pillows - If the Beatles and Pixies genetic codes were fused into a clone and said clone grew up on a healthy diet of sushi and awesome then this would be the Pillows(yes they are that Amazing) Check out &#039;Perfect Girl&#039;, &#039;Hybrid Rainbow&#039;, &#039;Last Dinosaur&#039;, &#039;Scarecrow, and &#039;Funny Bunny&#039; for an idea of their sound.

Radwimps - (like Linkin Park but much better) check out &#039;最大公約数&#039; &#039;Futarigoto&#039; &#039;おしゃかしゃま&#039;, &#039;有心論&#039;

Snowkel – Pretty good contemporary rock ‘Namikaze Satellite’ , ‘Solar Wind’ ‘Ōki na Mizutamari’, ‘Tenki yoohoo’

Eastern Youth –Screaming shaky vocals, somewhat technical. ‘Suro-mo-shon’ ‘Natsu no hi no gogo’ ‘雨曝しなら濡れるがいいさ’ 


Mellow Rock  

Unicorn – Specifically the song ‘Wonderful Days’ all their other stuff is more Alt Rock ‘Maybe Blue’

Kururi – Grand Theft Auto FTW!!!! ‘highway’

Remioromen – ‘3月９日’ ‘花鳥風月’ 


Pop Rock 

Flumpool –  catchy guitar riffs and melodies, shaky chipmunk lead singer, stringed instruments  ‘Hana ni Nare’

Ellegarden – Sound like Simpleplan but more sophisticated; pretty catchy stuff. Most of their songs are in English except for the following two(tell me if you know any other songs by them exclusively in Japanese please!) ‘Missing’ ,‘Monster’


Punk Rock 

Mongol 800 – like something out of a Tony Hawk soundtrack, Pachelbel’s Cannon riffs  – ‘Chiisana Koi no Uta’ ‘あなたに’

Blue Hearts –  Related to the Ramones, testosterone overload. ‘linda linda’ , ‘owaranai uta’ ‘train train‘ ‘人にやさしく’

Does –  ‘donten’ ‘shura’ 

Saboten -  ‘Scenario’ ‘aosora he’ ‘otana ni natte’


Metal(and any other subgenres)/Heavy rock

マキシマム ザ ホルモン – screaming, decent vocal harmonies, heavy guitar, no guitar solos ‘恋のメガラバ’, ‘ぶっ生き返す!!’

One Ok Rock –  ‘光芒’,  ‘恋ノアイボウ心ノクピド’


Girl Bands(cuz they’re special!)

Noodles – Bitter sweet vocal melodies, 60’s rock sound nothing too out there. Just plain good. ‘love my life’ ‘skin’ 

Go!Go!7188 – Unique vocals, punkish/ 60’s crunchy sounding lead guitar.  ‘C7’ ‘Kinkyori Renai’ ‘こいのうた’ ‘aoi’ 

Shakalabbits – a worthy skapunk band, cool guitar solos,  ‘Mushroom cat number plate’

Judy and Mary - high pitched voice a bit annoying at first but definitely worth getting used to.&#039;motto&#039;,  &#039;sobakosu&#039;, 

If you really liked any of these songs I have plenty more in the form of Youtube playlists. Check them out here.
PLEASE RECOMMEND ME ANY MUSIC after CHECKING OUT MY PLAYLISTS, thanks! fangsryoga@yahoo.com

<p>Pop Rock </p>
<p>Flumpool –  catchy guitar riffs and melodies, shaky chipmunk lead singer, stringed instruments  ‘Hana ni Nare’</p>
<p>Ellegarden – Sound like Simpleplan but more sophisticated; pretty catchy stuff. Most of their songs are in English except for the following two(tell me if you know any other songs by them exclusively in Japanese please!) ‘Missing’ ,‘Monster’</p>
<p>Punk Rock </p>
<p>Mongol 800 – like something out of a Tony Hawk soundtrack, Pachelbel’s Cannon riffs  – ‘Chiisana Koi no Uta’ ‘あなたに’</p>
<p>Blue Hearts –  Related to the Ramones, testosterone overload. ‘linda linda’ , ‘owaranai uta’ ‘train train‘ ‘人にやさしく’</p>
<p>Does –  ‘donten’ ‘shura’ </p>
<p>Saboten &#8211;  ‘Scenario’ ‘aosora he’ ‘otana ni natte’</p>
<p>Metal(and any other subgenres)/Heavy rock</p>
<p>マキシマム ザ ホルモン – screaming, decent vocal harmonies, heavy guitar, no guitar solos ‘恋のメガラバ’, ‘ぶっ生き返す!!’</p>
<p>One Ok Rock –  ‘光芒’,  ‘恋ノアイボウ心ノクピド’</p>
<p>Girl Bands(cuz they’re special!)</p>
<p>Noodles – Bitter sweet vocal melodies, 60’s rock sound nothing too out there. Just plain good. ‘love my life’ ‘skin’ </p>
<p>Go!Go!7188 – Unique vocals, punkish/ 60’s crunchy sounding lead guitar.  ‘C7’ ‘Kinkyori Renai’ ‘こいのうた’ ‘aoi’ </p>
<p>Shakalabbits – a worthy skapunk band, cool guitar solos,  ‘Mushroom cat number plate’</p>
<p>Judy and Mary &#8211; high pitched voice a bit annoying at first but definitely worth getting used to.&#8217;motto&#8217;,  &#8216;sobakosu&#8217;, </p>

					<description><![CDATA[if you&#039;re into rap music, it&#039;s definitely 「Tha blue herb」. A band from Sapporo who just RULEZ. they&#039;re among the very few japanese rap band that doesn&#039;t sounds like ジャニーズ with bling bling. I humbly apologize if you&#039;re into ジャニーズ or bling bling (orz).
for J-POP, it&#039;s 「shiina ringo」 and 「tokyo jihen」.
and for reggae... that&#039;s a tougher one... 「dry &#038; heavy」seems safe. produced in england and all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a fan of The Pillows. I got hooked to them when I saw FLCL (or Furi Kuri, sorry, I&#039;m unsure as to which one is politically correct), and if I&#039;m not mistaken they did at least 80% of the music for that great anime. After finding a Discography that I &quot;borrowed&quot; off my great friend, Mr. Enter Hiway ;D , I&#039;ve realized that unfortunatly their music only starts to get really into the swing of things in Runner&#039;s High, but after that it seems to be smooth sailing. I haven&#039;t had enough time to check out their newer stuff, but if you like alternative-rock (I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s what they&#039;re labeled), then I think you&#039;ll like The Pillows. The only downside I can name of them is that some of their lyrics are eigo (English. Sorry, I&#039;d at least try to spell it in hiragana, but it&#039;s not working for some odd reason), but once you get past that it&#039;s some pretty sweet stuff. Check them out, my friend may have a bay in the sea of Torrent (or at least that&#039;s what he says *wink wink*) that may be able to hook you up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love to listen Japanese&#039;s music, and for me the only j band that I really enjoy is RENTRER EN SOI! I listen their songs everyday, but still I don&#039;t understand how to learn japanese from the lyrics of song... I mean, I &#039;m not able to remember all the words used in the song... or I should learn at memory?

I love to read your Alljapaneseallthetime, and if still I&#039;m here to learn something by myself is only thanks your encouragement!
Thank you!]]></description>
