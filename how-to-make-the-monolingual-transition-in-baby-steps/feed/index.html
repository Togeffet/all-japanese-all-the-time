					<description><![CDATA[I agree. 

However, the biggest issue I&#039;ve ever had with children&#039;s dictionaries is that I can&#039;t really find one that I can use on my computer to copy/paste from. This means a LOT of manual entries, which are ... time consuming. On the other hand, furigana and having pictures for some things are awesome.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks!  I had picked up a grade school dictionary way back, in anticipation of the monolingual transition, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/why-i%E2%80%99m-in-love-with-my-japanese-japanese-dictionary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.  But by the time I actually got around to transitioning I had forgotten all about it! I&#039;d been managing to do OK with dic.yahoo.co.jp, more or less, but this really was a zillion times easier.  And then I tried out the app which was like another factor of a zillion times easier!  While I&#039;ll probably want to head back to adult dictionaries at some point (after 1000 cards, maybe?) for the time being this feels really game-changing.  Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My two yen worth...

For me, the transition to mono was a zillion times easier by starting out using a J-J dictionary made for grade school children.  Easy definitions, easy sample sentences.  Once I got used to that, I transitioned to a more adult-centric dictionary, but I still frequently go back to the kiddie jisho when needed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I left that comment when the article was originally posted in May. There was no link at the time and khatz deleted/removed the article the next day. Perhaps he posted it by mistake and wasn&#039;t ready.

Khatz could have been really cool and deleted my comment since he was gonna repost it later but why not make me look like a giant ass lol. It&#039;s cool though I ended up going monolingual on my own, I read some mono articles on ajatt plus and khatz&#039;s way just didn&#039;t work for me. I think he&#039;s right about going slow like &quot;add 1 card, pat yourself on the back.&quot; then you don&#039;t even review for a day or two... REAL SLOW, but I don&#039;t like it no... I disagree 100% with &quot;look up words you already know&quot; in fact, I think that is stupid.

What I did was just look up one or two words as I went along, new words, then... wait a minute I&#039;m not just going to tell you for free... but I did it kind of backwards to what khatz tells you and I think my method works better because you don&#039;t do hundreds or thousands of recursive look ups like khatz and jalup want you to do.. what a waste of time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well hi there. First off ジス・イズ・ア・ペン made me lol. Welcome to my apartment, at the moment. (English lesson time). 

So I&#039;m supposed to be done SS, but with Neutrino I am still an obese caterpillar. 
I spend most days listening to a lot of Japanese @ research sites. Complicated, grad school level Japanese. And I have recently let myself regress from mono SNS cards to bilingual, because I was hating my mono cards... hating. And I wasn&#039;t retaining anything, and I didn&#039;t know what the definitions meant, and.. yeah. 

And I am realizing that right now what I need to do is more systematically learn some of the basic terms I&#039;ve never picked up. Like... nihongo 101 terms that I breezed by before.
Going by interesting passages rather than &quot;words I NEED&quot; wasn&#039;t helping me get by in Nee-hon very well. So yeah... I started doing dictionary sentences bilingually, and find that I retain better that way. But I feel like maybe I&#039;m slowing myself down. Whadyathink?

So yeah, dunno if this is for me (broke-jotai aside) or not. And maybe this wasn&#039;t the right place to post this. Maybe I am trolling your blog. Time to leave my apartment, I think. 

p.s. you&#039;d better name drop me in your blog sometime. I am getting jealous of these other bitches. ;) Kidding, kidding!]]></description>

I&#039;ll do this though sign me up, because I want to finally get over this hurdle... Where is the link or pricing info or countdown? Unless I&#039;m missing something. I don&#039;t see anything above or in the ajatt store, in the source code, mother&#039;s legs etc.]]></description>
