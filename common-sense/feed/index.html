					<description><![CDATA[You write a lot about praising yourself for small achievements, and here you mention that no one else will (nor should they).  Do you have a post that goes into more detail on this that I just haven&#039;t read?  (I have only read a small fraction of the archives.)  Why should I do this thing that other people shouldn&#039;t do?  What is the rubric for deciding if a thing should be done by a person that gives such a different answer for me vs. not-me?  There are things like feeding yourself that you generally should only do yourself, but if you were incapable of them it would be desirable for other people to do them for you.  Does that not apply here?]]></description>
