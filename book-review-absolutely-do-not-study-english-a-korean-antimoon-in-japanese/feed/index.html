					<description><![CDATA[If it&#039;s professionally translated (like this book), I don&#039;t really see the difference. Korean and Japanese are a lot closer than to english, so it&#039;s easier to translate, so the translations will almost be 1:1, instead of lets say something like japanese to english, where for the english one you need to add more things for a sentence to make sense.

You&#039;re so right about Gokusen! It&#039;s just great... Now a challenge for the master: did you ever get what Yankumi is talking about in the &quot;practice interview&quot;, gokusen 2, episode 7, around 10 minutes?
Just checking ...   :)

Thanks for everything! Great inspiration...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Khatzumoto.

(Excuse my English, I&#039;m still learing it)

Your methods of learning Japanese really inspired me greatly. I&#039;m learning English in similar ways to your methods. I&#039;ve even created a blog to introduce your and Antimoon&#039;s way of learning foreign languages to Korean people.

But this book, &#039;Naver Study English&#039;, is not a good choice.
I&#039;m Korean and I saw how this book got it&#039;s famous. The book really thrilled many readers. But they began to find that the method promoted by this book was not even based on real experiences.

The author, Chan-yong Jung&#039;s English is not as good as your Japanese. And many readers who followed the book&#039;s instructions became frustred because it didn&#039;t work. Even after trying it for 2 or more years!

Has it occured to you that korea&#039;s lowest toeic rank is odd? The book came out in late &#039;90s (in Korea), and so many people follow the book, but we Koreans havent&#039;t improved much.

I cannot say the book is entirely wrong. Sometimes it gives great tips (and you quoted that parts), but we need more than that. 

I think your and Antimoon&#039;s methods are way more better than the book.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[^Listening practice is very important, and so is reading. Neither should be more important than the other. There&#039;s a lot of ways you can incorperate learning both at the same time, such as watching a drama in the language with it&#039;s script written in the language. It&#039;s good to practice them together, and apart. I know a lot of beginners who have trouble with listening, and that is fine, they aren&#039;t used to the language. They don&#039;t listen to it 24/7, they aren&#039;t constantly immersed into the language. The more immersed you are into a language, the more you&#039;ll start recognize patterns. My best reccomendation is to, as this blog says, start to change your enviroment into an all japanese, all the time type environment. It has helped me tremendously.

I have never practiced listening to French. I can hardly speak a sentence in French, yet I can read it fine, and I communicate with people online in French fine. I know a guy from Taiwan who writes very well in English. He has played online games in English, which requires you to write fast, so he has had a lot of expeirence with writing English with people who are fluent in English. However, he has a hard time speaking. Why is this? I&#039;m not sure really, but I think he never really focused on listening input when he was in Taiwan, he had just focused on reading/writing. People who are learning a language need to practice listening, they shouldn&#039;t wait until they can read first. I can repeat Japanese easily, whether I know the meaning or not, because I know how Japanese works. However, even though I can communicate in French well when writing, when I hear French it goes by me so quickly. I can&#039;t repeat what is being said, because I&#039;m not hearing everything. I don&#039;t know how the language works, even though I&#039;ve taken four years of French. I only started learning Japanese last September, but because I listen to Japanese constantly, I&#039;m recognizing how the language works. Practice listening now! Don&#039;t wait! There&#039;s no reason to wait. Focus on both reading, and listening. That&#039;s my opinion on it all.

Oh, and about listening without understanding the meaning of what is being said, this is a very good technique. I am surrounded with Japanese all the time, but I don&#039;t constantly have a dictionary by me. I&#039;d have such a headache! It&#039;s a lot of work to look up words I don&#039;t know, and I&#039;m fine with doing it, because I love the language, but sometimes I&#039;m just too tired. Life is tough, and it tires you out. It&#039;s okay to take a step away from the dictionary, and just listen. I watch Japanese dramas all the time without a dictionary both without subtitles and with, I listen to Japanese music without looking up everything, I&#039;ll watch to variety shows, and listen to talk shows without understanding exactly what is going on. Working on listening is important. Sometimes when you put down the dictionary for a second, and just sit back and listen, you&#039;ll realize how much you&#039;ve improved. You&#039;ll realize how you can hear every individual word, that the language isn&#039;t a blur anymore. You&#039;ll realize that you can understand some of what is being said, even if you don&#039;t understand everything as a whole, it&#039;s an accomplishment. If we spend all our time sweating by the dictionary, you&#039;ll miss out on the recognization of your accomplishments, you&#039;ll tire yourself out, and on days where you don&#039;t want to do anything, you&#039;ll go back to English and forget what you had learned.

(btw: sorry for complaining about navigating the drama scripts. I was being lazy, and didn&#039;t want to read every single thing in Japanese to find out how they work. Now I realize how lazy I was, lol)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read 英語は絶対、勉強するな, but I understand that the author encourages people to first listen without reading and without understanding the meaning of what is being said.  However, anti-moon seems to say the opposite: listening is difficult for beginners, so they should focus on reading.  What do you think of this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bought this book and two Japanese non-language-related books today. Plan on making them my first full books in Japanese and it&#039;s all very exciting! If you&#039;re interested, the non-language-related books I bought were 「極楽イタリア人になる方法」 (because I used to study Italian and thought it would be a good way to learn more about Italy without losing sight of Japanese) and 「KAT-TUNへ―赤西仁がやめた本当の理由」 (because I remember reading about this book when it came amount and thinking &#039;I want to read that when my Japanese is good enough!&#039;).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oops, fat-finger syndrome there - sorry about the partial post.

Anyway, what I was going to say before my fat fingers intervened was - (to the person requesting Gokusen scripts): is this useful:

And thanks for recommending Gokusen, Khatz - I am seriously getting into it (an a$$-kicking school teacher- fantastic!).

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I&#039;ll do that. I think this will work, that way I don&#039;t have to waste four years of French. Even though I&#039;m focusing on Japanese, I can still maintain my French by learning Japanese through French.

Also, I have another question (sorry for all the questions). I&#039;ve started watching Dragon Zakura again, this time with no subtitles, using a script, and a dictionary. The problem is that I don&#039;t know how to navigate the scripts on どらま･のーと. They seem to skip over some dialouge, because in the Dragon Zakura script I&#039;ll be reading dialouge, then suddenly the script will describe action in the movie, and then will go back to some dialouge. It&#039;s confusing this way, because I don&#039;t know when to listen to the dialouge because I don&#039;t know if the script is skipping over dialouge, or if I just lost my place in the script. How am I suppose to use these scripts?

Oh, and, did you ever use a script for Gokusen 1? I&#039;ve been looking all over for one. I love Yankumi&#039;s voice, I&#039;m trying to mimic the way she speaks (when she&#039;s not speaking like a yazuka, lol).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not too late to do Le Petit Prince in Japanese...it would be a good review, and you&#039;d actually learn more grammar and vocab than by directly &quot;doing&quot; grammar and vocab...

Maybe you can have a combination of system-working and Japanese/French &quot;synergy&quot;. For example, you can listen to Japanese music while working on French. Read articles in French about Japanese or articles in Japanese about French.

And, definitely, read stuff you&#039;ve already read in French in Japanese and cetera...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My art teacher actually recommended I studied Japanese through French. How would I go about that though? I should&#039;ve bought the Japanese version of Le Petit Prince (^-^) that would&#039;ve been fun to read a long with the French version. But we&#039;ve just finished Le Petit Prince, and now we&#039;re doing grammar, and vocab (text book stuff) for the next half of the year. Sigh. Well, I guess I&#039;ll work the system. Thank you.]]></description>
