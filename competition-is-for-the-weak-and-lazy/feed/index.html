					<description><![CDATA[Were you listening at all?  This isn&#039;t about the professor.  No matter what the professor is thinking, if *you* stop thinking of competing with your classmates, *you* will do better at the task at hand.  Even if the task at hand is something completely artificial, like taking a test in college, or throwing a rubber bouncy ball through a metal hoop.
This would be like Michael saying &quot;that isn&#039;t the mindset that most NBA referees have&quot;.  Yeah, even if it&#039;s true, who cares?  What possible difference does it make?  When you stop thinking about competing, the end result of this is &quot;you get a better score on the test&quot;.  In what world is that not a useful thing?
Or, I guess you could wait around for these &quot;most&quot; people to come around to your mindset before you do anything.  Good luck with that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey just wanted to say thanks for this post.
Its made me realise something about myself, I remember always thinking it&#039;s best not to compete with others, just because logically there&#039;s always someone better then you so why waste energy.I thought if I didn&#039;t do that then technically I&#039;d be competing with myself but I soooooo wasn&#039;t I was competing with the idea of me(or should I say the ideal me, so there&#039;s no margin for error or improvement, I can&#039;t compete with an ideal I&#039;m slaughtered as soon as I step in the ring). My logic wasn&#039;t objective enough and I hadn&#039;t consider all the factors. Hopefully I&#039;ll be able to apply this now and finally meet and compete with myself. :)  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a doctoral student, so I needed to read this post. My life seems to be about competing against others- for funding, for jobs, to write the most excellent research... etc. Or, in the case of people who study Japan, such as me, to be the most fluent.
I&#039;ve spent too long beating myself up, telling myself that I am bad at learning languages... when really, I&#039;m bad at certain ideas other people have about how I should learn a language. 
I really enjoy your writing and your attitude. Someday when my dissertation becomes a book, I&#039;ll be thanking you in the credits.]]></description>
