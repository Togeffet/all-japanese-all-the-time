					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] I didn&#8217;t control time, I controlled space instead. The content of my space was all Japanese. Time is a slippery bastard; space is much more tractable and stable. Control your space &#8212; your environment &#8212; time will take care of itself. And this is why, for the longest time, I was so vehemently opposed to giving a time-based account of &#8220;a day in the life of Khatzumoto&#8220;, because I wasn&#8217;t running on time, I was running on space and mindset.
