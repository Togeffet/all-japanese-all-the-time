					<description><![CDATA[KHATZU! I&#039;m not sure if you know or read about this, but one of the founders of Antimoon did something called the &quot;Norsk experiment&quot; for learning norwegian. You should check it out. You&#039;d be suprised. He went about it L2 first from the start. Check it out. I&#039;d like to hear your thoughts on it]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t necessarily think stubbornly hanging onto every little part of your culture, and forcing it onto your children is a good thing... but if you teach your kids to speak both the local language, and the &quot;mother tongue&quot; then that&#039;s fine.
