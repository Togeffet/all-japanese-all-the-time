					<description><![CDATA[Dan, keep motivated and you will be at a point where everyone&#039;s opinion doesn&#039;t matter anymore.  If now you understand 677 Kanji you will freak out a ton of illiterate Westerners who never learned one.  

You are on the right track.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hear you... lots of people were expecting me to translate their anime in real-time after 2 month of RTK. Just ignore and keep goind. I finished RTK a week ago, it took me about 4 months during which I kept the immersion going as much as I could. I&#039;ve been doing sentences for about 3 days now, and I&#039;m really surprised as to how natural the &quot;flow&quot; of the languages comes to me, if that makes any sense.

Oh, and find yourself a supportive japanese friend. The japanese wife of a friend was literaly showering me in praises for reading the instructions (writting in kana only) at the bottom of a ramen cup a few months ago. And mind you, I was just producing the sounds, not even understanding what I was saying. Imagine her reaction when I told her I went through 2200 kanjis. Great support -]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love when people think I&#039;m crazy for doing AJATT, it&#039;s definitely a motivator. What the problem is, is when people actually give it praise and continue to ask you how it&#039;s going and then expect you to be fluent within the first month. Very frustrating. Still in the Kanji phase, about 677 now and people who know about it ask me to say full sentences in Japanese and I just look like an idiot and it can bring demotivation which isn&#039;t good. But, I just gotta trust the system, keep having fun and smile at people who mock :)]]></description>
