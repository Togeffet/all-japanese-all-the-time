					<description><![CDATA[Just some ideas for those like myself who are sucky but getting there and want to do more complex sentences.

At the moment I&#039;m 1000 Kanji into RTK and loving it, but want to do sentences al&#039; natural (fresh and glistening with rich Kanji and the like.) Well, what I&#039;ve found with this is that it gets pretty hard when you see a big block of Kanji in a sentence - some might even say I shouldn&#039;t do sentences that hard right away, lol. Anyway, what I&#039;ve done is set up Anki with a &#039;hint&#039; field which I use hint peaking to see. What the hint gives me is the Kanji I find difficult + a clue (Helsig style). For instance I might see 会社 and have no idea, so I go for the hint and get [Kanji] = 
Man, I have to go work at my ... again!&quot; or &quot;Business people work and run them.&quot;

It works for me, give it a go. I recommend only doing ones you don&#039;t get after 3-4 tries.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm this is interesting. I was always wondering about this. This was the most concerning topic that i kept thinking about for Japanese learning. B/c I&#039;m convinced that my readings will become fluent in the not too distant future and as well as my understanding.  And my speaking will improve with the immersion(although i still think i&#039;m bad at speaking, it has gotten easier when reading kana and speaking general stuff). So my last concern is the writing. I was always thinking that kanji-kana was slow, it didn&#039;t really seem i could write all those kanji-filled sentences from memory with ease. It always took too much time or i failed it alot while doing my SRS anki reviews. If this can improve my writing sentences full of kanji, i&#039;ll do it for sure. Just need to wait till my reviews go down to around 100-200. Cuz right now, it&#039;s at like 500-700 nowadays.(I know that&#039;s a lot eh?-seriously annoying, so i&#039;ve dumb  down my sentences to 50 a day, now.). But eventually i&#039;ll start adding new sentences and do 50 kanji-kana and another 50 kana-kanji for those exact 50 sentences and i&#039;ll go on from there. Anyone got there own update on this process, b/c this intrigues me a lot nowadays.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using smart.fm for some time now. I recently took the approach outlined in this article, that is, reading-&#062;kanji sentence.

Using smart.fm I&#039;ve made an Anki deck that is audio-only, and I produce the full kanji sentence and kana reading.

At first it was slow going, but my listening has improved greatly, and other skills are not being deprived from exercise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatsumoto, great website! I&#039;m on my way to studying Chinese in University, but while I was twiddling my thumbs waiting, I spotted this website, and I said &quot;feck it shur. Why wait.&quot; (That is not a curse in Ireland btw, no need to censor me! ) So I&#039;ve started learning already! Thanks for the motivation.

Ok - so have you checked out www.Warez-BB.org for learning material?

I&#039;ve already downloaded a number of interactive language learning C.D&#039;s Check out &quot;Rocket Chinese.&quot; Its a good beginners package. The way the website works is you pay a membership fee. I&#039;d say go for the 3 day membership. Im not sure how expensive it is, but it will be worth it when you download as many things as you can in 3 days. Think of it. Not only language learning things, but computer programmes etc.

Ammm I have a question also. I downloaded RTH book 1 on Anki  on my laptop. I also downloaded it on Anki on my &quot;other halfs&quot; Laptop. Some symbols are slightly different ! Seriously! How am I supposed to know if I&#039;m learning the right ones!! I&#039;m freaking out. The only words I can think of off the Bat are &quot;straight&quot; , &quot;blade&quot; and &quot;uniform&quot;. They differ slightly...

How do I know which one is right???]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am slightly confused. I will be doing the kanji/kana over the course of the upcoming weeks and will head into the sentences right after that. I was just wondering how I&#039;m to know the readings of the kanji when I first start out. How am I to take sentences that I may or may not be able to read but have no idea how to pronounce and try to pronounce them? Can someone explain to me how you started with the sentences?

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ quendidil

I don&#039;t know if you will ever see this but...

Inflection is incredibly easy to remember. when I learned French I was worried about all the verb forms but I just read and listened. Eventually, you will just know what it meant to be. Inflections are not mystical at all. In English or Japanese you might use a particle or a preposition which is considered a word to show some sort of grammatical relationship in the sentence. Like say, &#039;with&#039; or &#039;on&#039;, which is just a SOUND that means something. But in a language with cases you use an inflection which becomes a part of the word. It can change the word itself and the inflection can change depending on other factors but the fact is, it&#039;s still just a SOUND representing meaning. With time your ear will just know what sounds right. I have NEVER memorized whether a French word it masculine or feminine. I just KNOW. It just sounds one way or the other. I think I must get it right 99% of the time. Even on words you just learned because words sound feminine or not. (if they don&#039;t sound feminine then they sound masculine and if they sound neither they are probably masculine)... in fact you don&#039;t think &quot;oh this is masculine&quot;.. no no... the word le or la just comes out, because, well, that&#039;s the only word that could come out.

Inflection and gender should be approached in the same way as any other language without them. Lots of exposure! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so I just realized you can do this SUPER easy in Anki cause its got the whole Production/Recognition duality thing, and I&#039;m excited bout that.  Just add another field for the word you want to learn, and you can have everything on the back (including the original sentence etc).  Every time you make a new card, just throw the new word in that field and your good to go.  

Oh, and thanks Khatz, for this site I mean, at least 100 cool points to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been doing something similar, but different, for the past couple weeks, and I think it&#039;s better than writing out the whole dang sentence.  Since writing the whole sentence takes for-ev-er, I just pick out the word I&#039;m trying to learn (it&#039;s usually only one anyway) and make a &quot;reverse&quot; card from the forward sentence.  

Front:
きょう・しつ
Back:
教室

Keep the sentence cards for learning context, but now there&#039;s no need to write &#039;em.  If you run into same sounding words, you can just give yourself some hints on the front.  I think it gives the kana&#062;kanji benefit in a more efficient manner.

Anyway, that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been experimenting with.  Try it, and tell me if it works for you too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Everyone and Good Work Khatz, you are an inspiration,

I am currently struggling with the 10,000 sentences aspiration, but I recently found a guy who has put 20,000 mandarin sentences on the web (http://www.mnemosyne-proj.org/node/115#attachments). The only problem is they are for mnemosyne, and I am an Anki-proselytiser! I have tried opening the 20000 sentences file in a web browser and then copy and paste them into Anki but it takes an age. Does anybody know how to convert these files into Anki??

zhen xie xie ni-men,

2nd I was wondering if someone knows a how to look for j-drama transcripts (eg. Anego, Zettai Kareshi, Kimi ha Petto, Hana Yori Dango etc.;Japanese with Kanji please)? That would be totally useful b/c I could listen to it while reading it and also I could picture the situation.]]></description>

&quot;After all, discussion proves nothing in this game: only results prove.&quot;

I&#039;m just writing to provide an update on my results, albeit rather qualitative in nature.  I&#039;ve now been using reading→kanji (r→k) cards for almost two-and-a-half months now and my ability to produce the vocabulary learned this way continues to be significantly better than vocabulary learned only with kanji→reading (k→r) cards.

The latest example that brought this to mind was a new card that I just added:
声を殺し身を潜め
When first going over it, I was thinking, &quot;Ah!  I&#039;ve seen 潜 before.  It&#039;s in, um, the word for that underwater naval vessel!&quot;  But I was unsucessful in actually thinking of 潜水艦 which is in one of my older cards; on the other hand, I have no problems immediately recognising the word when I see it.

It was at this point that I realised, again, that I can produce almost any word that I&#039;ve learned using r→k cards as soon as I think of the concept.  However, I have to concede that my progress in terms of cards/time with r→k cards is slightly lower than k→r cards.  I can only maintain an average spacing increment factor of 2.3 with the former while with the latter 2.5 isn&#039;t a problem.  (Id est, if I last saw a k→r card 10 days ago, I can safely not see it for 25 days, but to be safe with r→k cards, I have to see it after 23 days - on average)  Meh, minor qualm, but it&#039;s more than offset by the increased ability to actually make use of what I&#039;m learning.

All in all, I highly recommend using reading→kanji cards.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using this for about a week and a half now, and it&#039;s been going great. Thanks, Khatz. Something I&#039;ve found effective is putting the words that would normally be in kanji in katakana to avoid the 母は/ははは problem. 例えば...

(front)
そんなにイキトウゴウしたんだ
(back)
意気投合 - いきとうごう - 互いにすっかり気が合う事

If two kanji words come in a row, I just use &quot; ・ &quot; to keep their katakana forms distinct. 
 - ケッキョク・イッスイも出来なかった

I don&#039;t bother changing some of the easier words into katakana, like 出来る.  Does this sound reasonable, Khatz? Any comments/critiques?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jimmy

I just write out the particles as は、へ and を.  Sometimes it can be a little confusing and you have to read it both ways to see what fits, but with practice that becomes quicker and you won&#039;t even notice you&#039;re doing it.

I did have this in a question yesterday though:

はははあしたくる。

Took me a second to realise it was 母は!!]]></description>
