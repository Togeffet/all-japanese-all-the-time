					<description><![CDATA[[...] You&#8217;ll recall that I once said that AJATT has two principal aims. (1) To tell you what I did, so you can do it as well, and (2) to give you stuff I wish I had had, so you can do better. Â To that, we might do well to add a silent third aim: (0) To figure out what the heck it actually was that I did (and, as far as practicality and curiosity allow, why it worked) &#8212; in other words, to figure out some underlying principles.

					<description><![CDATA[Good advice. Let me offer my three conditions for success in language learning.
1) Your attitude: confidence, interest, affection for the language, desire to join in with speakers of the language, acceptance without asking &quot;why do they say it this way?&quot; etc.
2) Time spent : Study every day and take it with you to fill in the dead times. The more time you spend, in short spurts of long stretches, the better.
3) Ability to notice: Notice the sounds, the words, the structure, notice your gaps and look for them when you listen and read.

Cheers.]]></description>
