					<description><![CDATA[Hello Khazumoto,

yesterday I finished your free course made of 101 lessons. That&#039;s a great stuff indeed.

Unfortunately there are two errors in this course.

It happened twice that I got two the same lessons instead of a new one. 

First such a lesson was 90. It was not a new lesson but it was lesson 89.

Second time it was a lesson 97. It was not a new lesson but it was the previous one, 96.

So I want to ask you for sending me two links to the proper lessons, 90 and 97! Is it possible?

					<description><![CDATA[I definitely agree with how Japanese people are perceived to be borderline pretentious when it comes to the complexities of their language (at least by foreigners). But I think I have a lot of trust in the Japanese Education system, and they didn&#039;t necessarily screw up the kanji lists. I&#039;ve had a small taste of a Japanese local school, and the kanji learnt is categorised in topics, so for example in 3rd grade you learn kanji that is often used in literature, while in older years its focused on journals and articles. Most importantly you learn a mix of characters with simple and complex strokes; it just seems unfair to compare a small handful of kanji learnt by 5th and 6th graders.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I grew up in Tokyo, and then moved back to teach English in Skizuoka-ken in my twenties. I had certain assumptions, as all foreigners do when they first move there. I loved Japan, and since I&#039;d grown up with the culture, I expected to integrate easily. Sure, I looked different, and my Japanese would sound different, but I would be able to eventually find my place.

I think one of the main reasons why expats don&#039;t learn the language is that after awhile, foreigners realize that no matter how much they bend themselves into a pretzel, they will never fit in. Sure, some will date or even marry Nihongin, but they are quirky oddities: the funny gaijin, the genius who actually knows how to use chopsticks, any caricature or personae the Japanese can create in order to place gaijin into their comfortable definitions of what a gaijin should be.

It&#039;s human nature to want to fit in, and in a homogeneous society where &quot;the nail that sticks up gets hammered down,&quot; it can be psychologically devastating to realize that you will, in fact, never fit in. Not really. I&#039;d imagine that on a subconscious level expats refuse to learn the language as a way of saying &quot;F-- you&quot; to that cultural mentality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this wonderful article, Khatz. However, you say to not spend one or two hours practicing Japanese. I&#039;m confused though. What does practice in this case constitute. I just started, and I&#039;m learning kana before kanji. I&#039;ve got 20 kanji down, and I have my schedule down to 10 new kanji a day with ample review time. There&#039;s not much I can do with that, but I&#039;m listening to Japanese music and talk radio and podcasts practically ALL day even in my sleep, on top of watching J-drama. Right now I can&#039;t think of any other ways to practice the Japanese I CURRENTLY know short of playing my copy of Ore no Ryouri that I&#039;ve been playing. Please accentuate on what you mean here?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Having taken Japanese classes in Japan, my experience was actually that most of the teachers are very very enthusiastic and sweet, but are just terrible teachers. They have little training and little practice and you&#039;re better off doing it at home apart from one thing- the Nihongo &quot;cafes&quot; many of them offer- for a small fee one can show up and speak only Japanese with other learners in a low pressure environment, about the topic of the week. That, my friends, was worthwhile... because I met other foreign researchers, and I got to practice my nihongo without the panic that comes with talking to native speakers in Japan (for me- but I panic talking to people in general due to being very shy.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you really have hit the nail on the head in so many ways. I&#039;ve been studying Japanese for a long time now, in high school, in university, and I spent a year at a Japanese university and I decided to try out the teaching english/living in Japan thing, but so many people, in both of those situations, as you said, create this enclave for themselves. Its insane. There are, however, plenty of opportunities to get yourself out of that, though.

The other thing that I&#039;m happy you touched on was the nihonjin-ron. So many of my Japanese teachers (and textbooks!) have been condescending about foreigners learning Japanese. People and materials that are not positive or supportive are in no way creating a suitable environment for a language learner. 

thanks for a great post!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha, I love this. =D
I agree with 8 and 10. I remember seeing those commercials with that stuff; you can&#039;t get far with only 10 minutes a day. You would lose all that information during the day, and would have to spend another 10 minutes the next day on that same material.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;I’m wondering if it would be good to talk to them in Japanese
It would, if and only iff you have them CORRECT you mercilessly. Tell them, the smallest mistake, awkward pronunciation must be pointed out, even (if they&#039;re cruel people) ridiculed mercilessly. And if you find yourself making too many mistakes, then an input-heavy silent period may be in order. I had to take one of those at one point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz,
I have a Japanese roommate and two Japanese conversation partners (none of whom I speak to in Japanese intensively).  I&#039;m not that advanced in my speaking, hence the reason we don&#039;t speak in Japanese that often. I&#039;m wondering if it would be good to talk to them in Japanese or if it would damage my skills...I&#039;ve been studying for 4 years, but am just now getting &quot;good&quot; at speaking....

PS:  I like your site.  :)]]></description>
