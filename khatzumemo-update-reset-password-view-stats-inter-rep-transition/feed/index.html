					<description><![CDATA[@ Harry
Khatzumemo will only let you do the number of reps that it deems necessary based on your scores. So if you are scoring well you will not have to do as many reps or even extra reps of that kanji. Somewhere in one of his posts Khatz linked to an article that goes over the whole method behind Khatzumemo and other RSS programs, it says that doing repetitive reps over a short period of time will not increase the learning rate of those. You have to space out the repetitions over a longer time in order for you to remember them. Depending on how many kanji you are adding your reps will go up in number so that you will have around 100 a day, and that should take up your 20 min time block if you wanted. 

Anyway I hoped that helped, and others feel free to correct me if I was wrong in remembering the articles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question:
I orginally was going to go with Khatzumemo. It would have been nice, though when I started it, It would only let me review a certain number of times. It would let me do SOME extra reps. Then it would stop, I would litterly click to keep reviewing but it would say my reps were completed for today.

So I went to Anki.
T.T
A bit late to ask now obvoiusly, but how would I fix this? I like to review At least for a good 20 mins.]]></description>
