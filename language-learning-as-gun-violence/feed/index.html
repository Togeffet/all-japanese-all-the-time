					<description><![CDATA[I love this website... xD 
My mom thinks I&#039;m crazy. I was in a car accident just over a month ago, and I had to be homeschooled for half a semester and stuff. But I thought it was a great thing that happened, because now I literally can work on japanese ALL THE TIME 8D (except for the homework school sends me... Oh well...) 
So I think I&#039;m gettin&#039; a wholotta bullets, here. Constant bullets from my constantly-playing ipod with &quot;O! Naruto Nippon!&quot; (Totally amazing/amusing radio show with seiyuu from Naruto, the bestest anime/manga on the face off the planet~) and my favourite music, the kind where it&#039;s all in japanese, you know? :P And when I&#039;m not listening to my ipod, either I&#039;m listening to the same stuff on my computer so the ipod can charge or NON DUBBED/SUBBED ANIME! Plus getting Pirates of the Caribbean in Japanese, plus searching internets for things to read in japanese. And when the docs say I&#039;m better (no permanent damage yatta!) I&#039;m gonna go back to working and stuff as much as possible so I can afford to buy more (kinya guess?) JAPANESE STUFF!!!
WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!

					<description><![CDATA[@TheArtofBreath

You just have to have Python (the programming language) and mplayer (a supremely versatile media player) installed.

Here are some links:
http://www.python.org/download/ -- the 2.6.5 framework is fine
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html -- a little ways down the page where it says binaries... i&#039;d get the one for windows that says &quot;recommended&quot; out to the side... aside from that, i can&#039;t say... i don&#039;t use windows.

Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have The Matrix playing in the background while reading this.  (ネオ！　早く！)

It works impressively well as a Japanese dub.  The places are ambiguous (&quot;the city&quot;), the character names are weird anyway, and there&#039;s not much in the way of written language visible, so it doesn&#039;t have that &quot;Americans in America doing American things but speaking Japanese&quot; feeling that some dubs do.  Plus, it also has gun violence!

I can totally see why khatz watched/s so much Star Trek.  It&#039;s probably good as a dub, for the same reasons.  It seems entirely reasonable to me that the crew of the Enterprise would be Japanese.  Or, at least as reasonable as a French captain with a British accent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I constantly listen to music when I&#039;m at Uni and at work. Thankfully I just have to sit on my ass at work and can sometimes do some SRSing too.

I&#039;m finding it harder and harder to keep an interest in anime these days though, especially the new ones, but I try.

I found a nice website for Asian media though to help with my immersion (movies, tv, anime), with full DVDs, so you can switch audio and turn subtitles on or off to what you want. It&#039;s a private torrent tracker so that means you need to be able to keep a good ratio on the site (i.e. you need to upload more data than you download).
The site&#039;s called Asian DVD Club (http://www.asiandvdclub.org). It has a lot of DVDs to download in Japanese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Russian, among others.

Other than that I tend to watch Western movies dubbed into Japanese on http://www.nicovideo.jp too.

I&#039;m also currently trying to read my way through a bunch of manga, and that&#039;s probably the most satisfying aspect so far to me. It really hits home what you&#039;re doing when you can read through pages of stuff you love so much.

The environment&#039;s taken a while to set up but it&#039;s definitely keeping me motivated now.]]></description>

theres too many good TV shows to be limited by embedded English subs, I usually just open a window and cover the bottom portion of the screen. I know it&#039;s pretty simple, but it gets the job done ね]]></description>

Good point. Sort of like this guy:

&quot;THE last time Ishinosuke Uwano saw his brother, his sisters and his home town...he was a 20-year-old soldier heading for almost certain death on the battlefields of Manchuria. Yesterday, 63 years later, he returned to a country transformed — an old man barely able to remember his native language...

“I have not spoken Japanese for more than 60 years,” he said in Ukrainian through an interpreter...”&quot; http://bit.ly/905yAf &#124;  Mr Uwano comes back from the dead to say &#039;Good Day&#039; - Times Online  

Ebbinghaus and Wozniak&#039;s research would suggest that since intervals grow longer with spaced repetitions, there may come a point where the interval exceeds the natural lifetime, and therefore the a piece of knowledge could go un-reviewed for the rest of one&#039;s life with a 90%+ probability of never being forgotten. But then...few people SRS their native language yet. 

Like you said, definitely a matter of use it or lose it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%8A%E9%87%8E%E7%9F%B3%E4%B9%8B%E5%8A%A9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Uwano-san&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that perfectly.
