					<description><![CDATA[I do want to be thin and pretty like you ;)
Seriously though, one of the mistakes I&#039;ve been making is avoiding books that are popular. That&#039;s not a good strategy. It doesn&#039;t matter whether the popular book is in fact badly written... it&#039;s worth reading anyway.
It will probably become a pop culture reference too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I mean update the *language*. When the language has evolved so much that most people can&#039;t understand the original anymore, it needs to be translated into modern language. I enjoy classics very much, and have read more classics than most people my age (including Don Quixote ‚Äì although translated into modern Norwegian, so I have no clue how the language in the original is in terms of ease of understanding). I just find it too slow and time-consuming to read books whose language is so old and outdated that I can&#039;t easily understand them. I read a lot for pleasure in several languages, but I need the reading to be at a certain speed for me to take pleasure in it.

If the language was modernized a bit, more people would enjoy those books. Don&#039;t you agree that that would be a good thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How would you update a classic? Instead of Don Quixote riding on horseback, do you want him to drive a Ford truck? I&#039;m not understanding why it needs to be updated. Try reading a classic and you&#039;ll see it&#039;s not really as difficult as many seem it to be. But I understand some people just find them boring and that&#039;s a different matter as that is just a question of taste and what you like. But classics are definitely worth it. Oh goodness are they worth it. Some amazing books out there. And I wouldn&#039;t want a single word &quot;updated&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a reason why I have near-native English ability and still haven&#039;t read any Shakespeare. I&#039;m not ashamed to say that the only way I would understand it would be with so much effort that I would not consider it good use of my time. I still dare to say that my English is good enough.

I think it is the same with classics in my native language. They really need to be updated for the younger generation, because language evolves and the book isn&#039;t worth anything if no one reads it because it is too damn hard for the general population.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Firstly, I have always wanted to tell you, Khatzumoto: Thanks a lot! This piece of the web is totally awesome. Even though I lack your dedication, I have got tons of inspiration from your articles and they have helped me with my own learning path. And I trully enjoy reading you.

This piece is one of your finest, in my opinion. Too many people are worried to be seen reading what they would like to read. And too many choose books based on prejudices of others instead of using their own brains and hearts. And choosing something you are interested in, or even passionate about, is the best way to ensure you will get through no matter the harder parts.

In response to others in the comments: I love A.Dumas and V.Hugo and I&#039;m going to read them in French during the summer. The fact that they are available for free on Gutenberg is a nice bonus but I would even buy them or borrow them in the library if they weren&#039;t. But when reading the translation, I did skip parts of Les Miserables. I loved the story but I hated those ten pages long descriptions of old battles and stuff like that. So the advice about skipping is not a bad one actually. It&#039;s better to skip a page here and there than to throw the book away.

I have a trouble with number 9. I tend to find a few minutes here and there very easily but they often become the long hours I cannot afford.]]></description>
