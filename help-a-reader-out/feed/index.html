					<description><![CDATA[Ok, I&#039;m doing kanjis too. There were a couple weeks where i wasn&#039;t adding new kanjis( something along the lines of i shouldn&#039;t have downloaded a deck, making ur own cards is best), but i got really good at the ones i knew in that time, cuz i reviewed! But what i want to say, is that its really good to have lots of japanese text around. I can&#039;t read yet, but what i do, is i look through my ÊúùÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû newspaper, look at all the titles, and through w/e kanji i knew discover what the article is about. You could even do this in the bathroom! Its like having your SRS right there, but its recognition, not production. You might also learn some new words, even if you don&#039;t know how to pronounce it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, X-star! You like Death Note too, that&#039;s nice. I love the intellectual challenges between the characters, full of enormous chess(or shogi, etc) plans. In fact, I think it teaches the way one should think when facing a problem, like when L showed up to Kira. Kira held on till he was home to free his anger AND find a counter-attack plan.
By the way, this &quot;Death note&quot; topic(?) came right in time because I&#039;m really stuck. I was following Khatzumoto&#039;s advice about Native Japanese Words but I started feeling like &quot;Hey I&#039;m tired of seeing Âêõ„ÅåÂ•Ω„Åç„Åß„Åô. I want to go back to my „Éá„Çπ„Éé„Éº„Éà.&quot;, so recently I got the Death Note v13: &quot;How to read&quot;(in image form which makes it difficult(?) to sentence-mine). But then again, in contrast to the love manga/anime, these words don&#039;t seem to be used everyday. What should I do? Continue with the love manga/anime thing or switch to my loved „Éá„Çπ„Éé„Éº„Éà?
As for the readings thing, I also found „Åì„Åì for Âú∞ÁêÉ and other words. I didn&#039;t know it was common. Well, sorry for the long text, my worst habit I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey X-star
Mucho congralutatos (&lt;-- these aren&#039;t even words) on finishing RTK1!

&gt;I hope I don‚Äôt pick up a wrong reading for kanji that way.
Don&#039;t worry, man. There&#039;s no, like, &quot;pure&quot; &quot;unspoiled&quot;, &quot;proper&quot; version of Japanese that Death Note is somehow preventing you from acquiring. If it&#039;s made by and for native speakers then it&#039;s fine. We&#039;d never tell someone to not watch &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; because &quot;you&#039;ll start talking all sarcastic, like Chandler&quot;...

&gt;is this common?
It&#039;s part of the beauty and flexibility of the Japanese language. It&#039;s an amazing discovery, I think -- that you can disconnect the meaning and the reading of a word. People are sort of inventing new readings all the time, especially when it comes to their kids&#039; names..

I don&#039;t know if these are very convincing answers, though. Anyone else care to pipe in?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve finally finished RTK1, and am reading the Death Note manga &#039;cos I loved the anime and know the plot, and I&#039;m learning a lot from looking up interesting words I don&#039;t know from it. I understand now why learning the kanji was so important, it makes it so much easier. Though, I&#039;ve noticed from reading manga how strange Japanese writing is, sometimes one thing is written and a different, but related, thing is said. eg. Ê≠ªÁ•ûÁïå„ÄÄwas written as„ÄÄthat but said as „Åì„Åì from the furigana which is understandable because they were in the Shinigami world, but why couldn&#039;t they just write &quot;„Åì„Åì&quot;? Slightly confusing, I hope I don&#039;t pick up a wrong reading that way.
Compounds are quite hard to remember too, should I memorize them with mnemonics or start trying to associate kanji more with Japanese than the Heisig meaning? One that particularily tickled me was ÈÇ™È≠î which is made up of &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;witch&quot;, so now I think &quot;the wicked witch was „Åò„ÇÉ„Åæ/in the way‚Äù]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve finally finished RTK1 and I&#039;m loving reaping the rewards. I&#039;m reading the Death Note manga  because I loved the anime and know the plot, and I&#039;m learning quite a lot from it by looking up interesting words I don&#039;t know. I can see now why learning the kanji is so important, it makes it so much easier. Though, Japanese writing is very strange, writing one thing and saying something else at times, according to the furigana. Like writing Ê≠ªÁ•ûÁïå but saying „Åì„Åì, which is understandable because they are in the Shinigami World but why don&#039;t they just write „Åì„Åì? When people fluent in Japanese read something like that without the furigana, would they instantly read it as „Åì„Åì because of the obvious context? Sorta confusing, I hope I don&#039;t pick up a wrong reading for kanji that way.
It&#039;s also confusing that some words can have more than one reading, like ‰∫∫ÈñìÁïå was said as „Åí„Åã„ÅÑ„ÄÄand then later as „Å´„Çì„Åí„Çì„Åã„ÅÑ, is this common?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[quote]Ok, I can‚Äôt completely answer this one from experience. Assume 250 hours active study time for Kanji (assuming you‚Äôre doing RevTK), about 400 hours of active study for your first 1000 sentences (utilizing starter sentences meant for building vocabulary, grammar and kanji readings) with additional 400 hours for every 1000 past that. So, after 1500 hours of active study you should be damn close. Estimate 2 hours per day active with the others hours in passive mode (listening, reading, watching TV, radio, movies, manga, etc.) that could equate to two years. These are rough numbers based off my current experience of only 300 sentences. I assume you‚Äôll put in the work everyday in addition to enjoying Japanese things outside of studying.[/quote]

Personally I haven&#039;t had many hours open for active study, so I tried to be very time efficient.  I realized that since we are dealing with large numbers of kanji and large numbers of words, a small difference in time spent on each one can have a huge impact on the overall time it takes.

RTK1 took me about 150 hours.  I tried to make use of as many shared stories on RevTK as I could to save time (for over 90% of kanji I borrowed a story) , and by doing so I quickly got very good at making other people&#039;s stories work for me.  Now a little over one month after finishing the last kanji, I have 98% in the last stack and on average about 25 reviews to do per day, which take about 5 to 10 minutes to review daily, so count 2.5 to 5 hours ongoing review per month for RTK1.

I know some people spend a lot more time than that on RTK1.  I didn&#039;t do anything magic, just used Anki for reviews adding about 20 new kanji per day (spending about 2~3 minutes learning each one) and always doing every outstanding review every day.  It was all about learning how to use the visual stories, and never letting failed kanji build up at all.

For sentences initially I picked things from grammar books.  This is fairly quick because it doesn&#039;t take much searching, as grammar books usually provide example sentences with translations to use with your SRS.  As I got more happy with grammar I wanted more vocab, and I started going through the 2001.Kanji.Odyssey books.  Again this is fairly quick since you have example sentences for each compound in the book with translation, and the examples are designed to be efficient in introducing related vocab.  The amount of time spent setting up each SRS card is short while doing this.  About 90 hours per 1000 cards.

For sentences that I have to search the required time is longer, so I try to do only a limited number of these per day for now, just plucking things that I hear repeatedly on TV or read somewhere and is interesting to me.

I know Khatzu recommends just doing whatever interests you.  I do plenty of that, but I am also trying to use 2001.K.O for systemized vocab study because it seems to me to be time efficient.  It&#039;s a learning experiment on myself, if you like.  A lot of the vocab I&#039;ve learned through 2001.K.O later turns up in my Japanese input, so that&#039;s very satisfying.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[quote]Ok, I can‚Äôt completely answer this one from experience. Assume 250 hours active study time for Kanji (assuming you‚Äôre doing RevTK), about 400 hours of active study for your first 1000 sentences (utilizing starter sentences meant for building vocabulary, grammar and kanji readings) with additional 400 hours for every 1000 past that. So, after 1500 hours of active study you should be damn close. Estimate 2 hours per day active with the others hours in passive mode (listening, reading, watching TV, radio, movies, manga, etc.) that could equate to two years. These are rough numbers based off my current experience of only 300 sentences. I assume you‚Äôll put in the work everyday in addition to enjoying Japanese things outside of studying.[/quote]</p>
