					<description><![CDATA[Taleb says: &quot;You can focus your reputation or your actions but not both.&quot;
...and: &quot;It is as difficult to avoid bugging others with advice on how to exercise and other health matters as it is to stick to an exercise schedule.&quot;
...and most importantly: &quot;There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Sadly I also told people about the SRS (How stupid was I) now there is more competition for higher class rank.
Â 
There is no competition with others, there is only competition with the enemy within :)
Â 
lol but yeah, I know what you mean. Back in high school, I once showed a friend of mind named B-Dawg a cool Photoshop technique I came up with. He then showed a bunch of other people, and they were all like, &quot;Omg! You&#039;re amazing, B-Dawg! [fake name :P]&quot;, and even the teacher was like, &quot;Wow B-Dawg, great job figuring that out, you get bonus marks!&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[The Buddhist in me suggests that advice should be freely given because even if people don&#039;t appreciate it now, they just might someday.  Speaking as one who is pretty thick-headed, I know this to be true. :-)

You don&#039;t hit them over the head with it, but naturally you don&#039;t want to withhold it either. That defeats the purpose of generosity.

Look up the Four Bodhisattva Vows sometime on Google if curious.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A friend, once told me to do this with my programming and tech know-how. I was of the type that just HELPED everyone out, and funny, soon as I started telling people that I would bill them for my time, the calls and annoyance stopped, almostÂ instantaneously. And I love it that way.

Good advice is definitely worth sharing, but one should choose the recipients well... very well.Â ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally I like to think that if the advice is &quot;worth its weight in gold&quot; then it is worth letting everyone know. 
Indeed it is true that &quot;Truly good advice should be like a truly good stock tip &lt;a title=&quot;Here we go again with the stock similesâ€¦&quot; href=&quot;the-righteousness-of-selfishness#note-7231-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: it should work whether or not other people agree with you on it; it should work whether or not forum trolls and IRL trolls know about it and cosign onÂ it&quot; and that&#039;s why I believe worthy advice is worth telling - even if they don&#039;t agree with it, it can still help them. Even if their ego refuses to accept it, it can still positively affect them.
It doesn&#039;t have to be that the provider needs to tell people, but that the receiver needs to hear it.Â Â ]]></description>
