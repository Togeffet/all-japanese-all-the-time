					<description><![CDATA[I too found podcasts really helpful for getting used to the flow of Japanese. I found an entire podcast channel through iTunes (ニッポン放送) years ago that has not one, but several shows which you can subscribe to. After a while, I got a feel for the shows I liked and which ones I didn’t.

I remember one show in particular, they talked really fast and had lots of banter going back and forth. After first I’d listen and not understand anything for 10 minutes. But over time, I could follow along more easily until I realized that I could (more or less) understand what they were talking about.

What a nice feeling.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Did Yomiuri kill their podcasts?  Get a 404 error on that link.

iTunes now has a pretty extensive collection of Japanese language study postcasts.  I&#039;m grabbing an &quot;episode&quot; of each to see what they&#039;re like:
http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewRoom?fcId=272741525&#038;id=33

Some are a bit weird -- like the one that appears to be all about learning how to speak with an Osaka dialect.

(Also:  The Table of Contents page links to:
http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/wp-admin/Podcasts:%20Simulate%20Real%20Japanese%20Friends

Which is wrong -- gotta kill wp-admin to get it to load right.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At this moment I don&#039;t know any Japanese, I&#039;m a lvl zero. I started reading your blogs and a.t.m. my E is very high. I&#039;m absolutely motivated. I&#039;ve watched 2 Japanese dramaseries with subtitles so far and while doing stuff for school I listen to Japanese songs on my Ipod. I have the RTK books and started reading in the train but I haven&#039;t used any SNS yet, which I&#039;m going to do after I submitted this comment. 

It&#039;s actually learning Japanese about the same way I learned English. 

About this blog:
I probably won&#039;t understand a word they&#039;re saying for a very long time - but I&#039;m definitely going to download this. Thank you!]]></description>
