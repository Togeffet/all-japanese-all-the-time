					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Baby care doesn&#8217;t end at birth. Parenting doesn&#8217;t end when the baby can walk.

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, I always kept thinking I was so sucky(is this even a word? lol) in Japanese. So that intern made me work harder for it. But now since I&#039;m 9.4 months of learning it(not counting 3months of RTK1+3). I feel I&#039;m really far from the beginning, my skills in the language aren&#039;t where I want them to be. But nowadays I have been giving myself a pat on the back, no need to be harsh on yourself. If you just keep putting in the time,immersion, the &quot;equipment&quot; necessary to become good. You will become awesome in the language in no-time. There is absolutely no reason why you cannot get native-abilities in the language. But it does require time to allow the &quot;equipment&quot; to grow. 

I&#039;m sure I&#039;m speaking for everyone when I say, don&#039;t put yourself down. Just keep plugging into Japanese and you will be rewarded for your effort(your skills will do the talking people!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a lot of thirst. But at the same time, I almost don&#039;t want to learn too much. Because I&#039;m still in the RTK phase. 

Since I&#039;m there, I don&#039;t want to go through sentences yet. And yet, It&#039;s hard not to learn and pick up little phrases! Especially when listening to music, watching anime, and Star Trek. You pick things up. It&#039;s almost like you can&#039;t not pick it up. 

Focus... I&#039;m still in the RTK phase and I can only do so much kanji in a day. Okay, enough. Time for more reps.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto,
Awesome site man!  Love your approach to learning!  Seems like it could be applied to all sorts of things- music, martial arts, almost anything.

Babies are often encouraged so much by their parents with language- anything they say is amazing and if they say something wrong it&#039;s &#039;cute&#039;.  And people are constantly talking to them and encouraging them.  Plus all these people that talk to the baby have mastered that native language already!

					<description><![CDATA[記事はすごいです。大好きです！

This is something I myself have to watch out for all the time, that I&#039;m not punishing myself for being &quot;thirsty&quot; or &quot;hungry&quot;, but to instead quench that thirst/hunger in a controllable way. It has to be a balance. If you eat too much too fast, you&#039;ll choke. If you eat too little too slow, you&#039;ll starve. Balance your &quot;diet&quot;.

Love the post title by the way, &quot;Why have you been killing babies?&quot; ^^;]]></description>
