					<description><![CDATA[Just a point, in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.8, the progress in the progress bar is smaller than it should be, ie it looks half full at 66%. Is there something I can do to fix that or is that Khatzumemo?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Question:

With my Chinese reps I am always given 100 reps per day, but for some reason with my Korean reps I only get anywhere from 4-25 per day. I have about 200 Korean items so far, but shouldnt the number of daily reps be higher than that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love your site to the nth power!!  Been a fan of it since December 2008.  Anyways, I&#039;ve been reading the archives pertaining to SRS.  In one of your posts, you wondered whether a non-Japanese mobile phone would be capable of kanji input(or was it using KhatzuMemo?)

Well, I don&#039;t know if this info has been mentioned,but the Iphone 3G is capable of doing so.  I can attest to this fact because I live in Miami, Florida.  I currently own an Iphone...and tested KhatzuMemo to see if it would be compatible.  So yeah it works!...

I wanted this to work because, like you, I don&#039;t want to lug around my 6lb laptop that only gets 2.5 hours of battery life everywhere I go.  And the minor, maybe major in some circumstances, mission of acquiring an IME and/or Japanese text editor felt like a pain in the abstract as I don&#039;t have fast-access internet at my house.

So, My goal was to find an efficient and less messy solution...and the 3G Iphone works wonders!!!

Keep spreading the knowledge, Khatzu, because at least I&#039;m listening and acting on most of your tips...Brother, as a fellow L2 learner, you&#039;ve got my deepest respect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was going to sign up and try it out, but the 6 character minimum on username and 10 character minimum on password deterred me... I&#039;d like to use one of my usual low-security username/password combos since this isn&#039;t like... banking info or anything. Any chance you could lower the minimums a bit?]]></description>
