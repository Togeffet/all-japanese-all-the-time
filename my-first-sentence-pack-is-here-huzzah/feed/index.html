					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] My First Sentence Pack (MFSP for short) is simply amazing as an introduction in getting started with sentences. In fact, it&#8217;s so easy, that at first you&#8217;re practically just learning words that can be used as phrases (such as 「何だ？」, 「あれ、何？」, and 「どう思う？」 ). As you move along, everything is focused on the i+1 concept, so it&#8217;s always building your foundation little by little, brick by brick. I can&#8217;t speak for others, but for me I never felt as if suddenly too much was thrown at me. I obviously learned new words, grammar points, etc often but always in an easy i+1 fashion.
