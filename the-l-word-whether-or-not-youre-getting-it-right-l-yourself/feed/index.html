					<description><![CDATA[This, in general, is why I love video games. They give you a safe environment to fail in. You screw up and die or get stuck? All you do is hit &quot;restart&quot; or reload a save and you&#039;re allowed to try again, over and over until you do it right. Nobody is judging you (well, in the case of multiplayer games it&#039;s not necessarily true, but still!)

I also wonder why people in a classroom setting are so afraid of doing something wrong, and that includes me. Now that I&#039;m in university, it&#039;s ironically way more lax than high school. You can fail two tests with no consequences. If you fail more, you can retake them as many times as you want, as long as it&#039;s before the semester ends. If you say something wrong, the teacher just corrects you, he&#039;s a nice guy, nobody mocks you, nobody laughs (unless your mistake made you sound particularly funny.) But it still feels like you failed, like it&#039;s the end of the world and people are scared to speak up, scared to make a mistake. Why is it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;. Because the trick to winning/getting good at most games is just sticking around. Sticking around until you win. And the getting used to a language game is no different.&quot;

This sentence, much sense it makes.

*Boring semi-long story to follow*
I have a group friends from high school that I still hang out with.  A few years ago my friends were huge into playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  They were/are very good at the game.  Whenever I hung out with them, we would always be playing brawl.  I was ALWAYS out first.  I was ALWAYS out fast.  I was ALWAYS sucking at the game.  But I kept coming back for more.  This went on for months, literally months of me still going over weekends to hang out and get destroyed at Brawl. Play a bit, lose, and sit there for a few minutes while they finished the match. Yeah, I didn&#039;t have anyone else willing to hang out with me XD.

I&#039;m sure you can guess where this is going.  After several, several months of getting destroyed, I  started getting destroyed less.  After a few months I was able to actually take one of their stocks.  Several months afterwards, I could take 2 of their stocks.  Fast-forward a bit, and suddenly I could hold my own.  Occasionally I won by luck.  Now, I&#039;m still not as good as them, but I&#039;m a lot better now.  Hilariously, now when I play other &quot;casual&quot; players at brawl, I absolutely destroy them without trying.  All of that time sucking has lead up to me being decent now.

Why the long story?  Because it was success by simply sticking around.  It was success by being too stubborn to give up, and too lame to have other friends XD (kidding of course, I love those crazy guys).

Now, I can take that scenario, and apply it to Japanese.  I&#039;m through RTK, and fully into MCD&#039;s.  Soon, I&#039;ll be able to hold my own, I just have to stick with it ^_^.

Thanks Khatz, (I can use that because we&#039;re friends now right?)
Just coming to this website is always so inspiring, and gives me the push to keep going.]]></description>
