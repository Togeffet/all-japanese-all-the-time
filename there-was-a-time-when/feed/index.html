					<description><![CDATA[I really like this website - mostly because it confirms my own beliefs :-)

For many years, I have believed that language classes are next to being utterly useless - and just as you say, the vast majority of textbooks are just the same. However, whenever I have uttered these beliefs to language learning friends, I have always just recieved howls of derision!

It is also nice to see you also highlight the importance of mental tools - the people who succeed at the really tough things in life are always those with the right mental attitude, and obviously need not be the ones with the greatest &#039;natural ability&#039;.

Anyway, please keep up the good work, and keep us posted on how the Chinese in going.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting post and cool to see the evolution of a Japanese learner. I can use chopsticks, know what an SRS is, and know how to say hello in Japanese and Korean, but I can&#039;t read Japanese subtitles fast enough, can&#039;t read a book/newspaper without a dictionary, and can&#039;t understand Japanese news.

It&#039;s just a matter of time and learning. I&#039;m hoping to be able to leave early the programme I&#039;m on now, so I can get to Tokyo and live with Japanese people as soon as possible.

Great post!]]></description>
