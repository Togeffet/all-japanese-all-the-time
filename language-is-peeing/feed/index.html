					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m super late to the party, but can we add something about making mistakes to the metaphor? Maybe from the male perspective?

When you&#039;re first learning to pee on your own, you&#039;re going to miss a lot. Don&#039;t be hard on yourself, everyone misses. You&#039;ll get better the more you pee, but don&#039;t forget that if you want to practice peeing, you have to drink a lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Beer - you pee almost instantly, almost everything you put in, you have Fun drinking and after a while even peeing. And with practice you can drink more and pee more and if you wake up the next day with a hangover, you just reach out for another beer and it keeps on rolling. With time you get addicted, you drink all the time and you don&#039;t even bother to go to pee. You just wet your pants sitting on the couch with the pile of cans all over the place and no one&#039;s coming to see you anymore, everyone left you. Now you&#039;re just a lonely drunk who think to himself when he sobers up: &quot;Life is crap&quot; and you drink again and keep drinking. Until you die and nothings left.
What i want to say is don&#039;t overdo it. And be careful with what you drink lest you hurt yourself. And you need some nutrients too. I mean your Japanese (baby) will die without food (knowledge, humor, stuff) as well. ]]></description>

If you go to the htlal forums you can read some ppl who talk about this problem they have....tons of passive input doesn&#039;t necessarily translate into conversation ability. I&#039;ve noticed that my spoken l2 ability increases in proportion to how much time I spend doing it...it&#039;s needed for my brain to learn how to make all that passive stuff active.

					<description><![CDATA[If I might add my 2 cents to the metaphor...
 
Even when you&#039;re dehydrated, it is possible to pee more by taking diuretics. (Diuretics = L1 to L2 cards, set phrase memorisation, bluffing your way through by learning how to say &quot;thing&quot; in L2, &quot;Speaking From Day One&quot;, romaji, etc)
 
Speaking as a doctor*, although diuretics may help you produce more urine, they have side effects that can damage your kidneys as well as your general health and well being.
