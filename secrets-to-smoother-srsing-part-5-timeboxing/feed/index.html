					<description><![CDATA[I think time boxing was something that actually motivated me to do to my Reps, as through time-boxing, i am spending the least possible time on the language whilst achieving a very level of productivity. In addition, time boxing allows me to treat Japanese like a &quot;game&quot; and venture for new methods to make the process more efficient.

					<description><![CDATA[I did a time box test yesterday, but not quite like it&#039;s outlined here. -- What I did was, I used a program that tracks how long you&#039;re working on something, and to stop it, you switch the active activity to &quot;Off-clock.&quot; What I noticed was that I learn Kanji much quicker than I originally thought. This was both, motivating and relieving. What this also did for me was track how much time I spent being distracted from actually making progress. If I wasn&#039;t distraction free and thinking only on the character at hand, then I would off-clock. One other thing that I think this helps is that, like the time-boxing method outlined above, it gives you a slight pressure to keep moving. I tried to keep each Kanji under 5 minutes. I ended up getting ahead of time, but then came an overwhelming amount of distraction. (I&#039;m home this week from college, so family is being quite demanding of my attention. Note: never, ever have younger sisters. If your parents are considering having another child, tell them not to. ;) ).

Anyway, I just wanted to share that bit of experience I had with some form of Time-Boxing. It does help keep me on task. And now, off to make some progress.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Rob
On weekdays, I generally don&#039;t have much time for reps before 10 PM or so, so I have to admit that I&#039;ve cut the &quot;writing&quot; part out my reps for the most part...    

I don&#039;t like it, but I figured that review and new knowledge have a higher priority for the time being. 

That site is great, btw! Definitely looks like there&#039;s some fun to be had there, thanks a lot :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1-2 minute SRSing? Interesting idea, but when I hear that it makes me curious about something. When you (including all readers) are SRSing, what percentage of the time are you dictating and writing out the full sentence? 

I nearly always write out the sentence after listening to it, which takes more time of course, so doing only 1-2 minutes would probably only get me through 1 or 2 sentences. I prefer doing it this way, but I can help but wonder if more people are doing it differently.

On a side note, I came across this site:

http://www.freshverse.com/tv.php

This is a first. It is live Japanese TV (usually it&#039;s on Fuji „ÉÜ„É¨„Éì) that is embedded on the webpage so no external player is required. Pretty sweet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recommend anyone using Anki to download the RLC Blitzer Plug-in. It&#039;s a plug-in that can help you &quot;timebox&quot;. 

Say, you open Anki, and have 300 reviews, initially you do 10 reps. And then the Blitzer asks if you want to keep going; &quot;5 more cards&quot;, &quot;1 more card&quot;, &quot;Enough&quot;. It will prompt you a minute later if you want to keep going, if you pressed enough. Try it! It&#039;s very useful, I get through about 300 reviews in 2 hours with it, and it makes it a lot easier!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It may seem minor, but a few years back I began to take the Two-Face (from Batman) approach to indecision. If I really was indecisive about something down to two choices, I flipped a coin and stuck to it. Plus, if it turned sour, I just blamed luck and not my choice. I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s psychology behind it, but I think people on average feel better following choices made by other people or even fate. Plays on your time boxing method, as the clock is making the call and not you. That we&#039;re the one that flipped the coin (and decided which decision is assigned which), or turned on the clock (and decided what the task will be, and for how long) is irrelevant.]]></description>
