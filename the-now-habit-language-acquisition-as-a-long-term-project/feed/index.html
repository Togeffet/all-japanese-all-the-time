Waking up early two mornings in a row (jet lag), I read it from cover to cover. Talk about exciting, the words spoke straight to me. I can&#039;t wait to get home to start on it. 

And now, instead of sharing a language learning to-do list, my New Years Resolution post will be all about how The Now Habit fits.

					<description><![CDATA[hi Khatzumoto,
  thanks for your enthusiasm for The Now Habit: Overcoming Procrastination with Guilt-Free Play. Also, at www.audible.com under Self-Development Audio Books. See www.neilfiore.com for more CDs and &quot;Awaken Your Strongest Self&quot; for putting your higher/human brain in charge of your life--instead of your fearful, self-doubting ego.
  Tips: shift from &quot;I have to finish&quot; to &quot;When can I start for 30 minutes?&quot; to give your brain a clear image when to show up and for how long I will be in prison with a critic before I get to have fun.
  See blog: www.neilfiore.blogspot.com for more tools 
   Best Wishes, Neil Fiore]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read this already!!! :)

One of my faves....

I read it about 2 years ago. and then i threw it away. And then this year, i missed some of the strategies on it and i had to buy it again. 

Yuppp...mine is all crayoned (i don&#039;t use highlighter, the paper is too thin)

ANd this book was truly one of the ones that changed my life with its simple and yet so unheard of topic of CHOICE.
I can&#039;t begin to describe how just the use of that word helps me in my procrastination.

I love Neil Fiore :)

IN FACT...you should read his other book: Awaken your strongest self. OMG. ilove that one. Its basically all the things he talks about in TNH, but it goes more in depth.


I also recommend OPTIMAL THINKING (not by Fiore), which im reading right now]]></description>
