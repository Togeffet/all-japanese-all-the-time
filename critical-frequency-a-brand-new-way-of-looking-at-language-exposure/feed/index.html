					<description><![CDATA[This has actually happened to me with my japanese. I&#039;ve been studying it on and off for many years (about 8 years), like three months of focused study and a year without active study. But even when I&#039;m not actively studying it, I&#039;m often in contact with native content like japanese music and TV dramas. It has amazed me that even without active/focused study my japanese is not only maintained but it&#039;s actually improving!]]></description>

On the other hand, if it wasn&#039;t for the daily contact with Portuguese speakers, I would have already forget my mother language or have even a harder time remembering unusual words. Seriously, it is very difficult to keep in touch with everything you ever learned so you won&#039;t forget (physics, as an example, is something I&#039;m completely clueless about nowadays)...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the weekends when I am with my son and wife. I always do my kanji review at night, but through out the day I point to things and tell my son what its name is in Japanese or I&#039;ll have my iPhone handy with Kotoba.app just to browse here and there. I do this mainly out of respect that my wife and maybe my son don&#039;t want to be consumed with Japanese all day on the weekends, but I definitely make sure to do &#039;some&#039; Japanese at &#039;some&#039; point during the weekend.

I am going to try the 2mins / hr. exercise... sounds interesting.

I tried doing the &#039;some&#039; Japanese every hour on the hour while I am work but sometimes I&#039;ll get sidetracked by... pfffft, work!

So maybe, by telling my head &#039;2mins only&#039; I might play a trick on my brain and it&#039;ll actually let me go for more than 2mins, like Khatz stated also.]]></description>
