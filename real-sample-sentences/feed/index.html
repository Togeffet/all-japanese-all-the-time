					<description><![CDATA[Excellent website.
I&#039;ve just started using your technique for the sentences (SRS). (As you recommended, I&#039;m using mnemosyne (on ubuntu))

For all those using mnemosyne or similar programs with import methods, and as a follow-up to what Charles A. said, do you think it would be possible for you to &quot;export&quot; your sentences (editing the one you&#039;d feel uncomfortable about :)) . I&#039;d really like to be able to edit someone else&#039;s personal deck of cards and add my own (contributing it back, obviously). 
Anyway, if you feel uncomfortable about this, sorry for the request and in any case, Thanks again for this absolutely fantastic website.

Also, btw, you said: Do the Remembering The Kanji thing now and thank me later. Now, I  want to officially thank you. :))]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bucko, you can switch off the reverse cards in Anki (and Mnemosyne for that matter). Most likely you&#039;ll only want it one way.

Khatz, think the time will come when someone (or group) will create a site similar to Reviewing the Kanji, but with one to two thousand sentences organized and vetted for efficiency to get the foundation started for Japanese? What would be your current opinion of such a site?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey man, your methods are fantastic. I&#039;ve been doing the SRS trick for the last 5 months and I&#039;ve noticed a MASSIVE difference in retention.

Just got a question for you. You say 10,000 sentences. My SRS program (Anki) inputs each sentence twice, one as question-answer, the other as answer-question. Are you saying that 5000 sentences, either way (10000 in total) is the way to go, or is it 10,000 unique sentences, 20,000 all together in my SRS?  At the moment I&#039;m up to 508 unique sentences, 1016 all up.

Cheers,

Bucko]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatzumoto,

I have a random question from one of your old posts.  You mentioned that you were using stickers to mark unknown readings in your books, and that the ones you found didn&#039;t stick well enough to destroy the surface of the page when you took them off.  Do you mind sharing the brand and/or where you got them?  I&#039;ve tried a few that I found near me, but they all rip off the text underneath when I take them off.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Glenn
So far, I&#039;ve read quite a bit of manga (デスノート、クレイモア、らきすた、最遊記、すずか、ちょびつ、 SLAM DUNK, ちょびっ）, but as for longer texts, I am currently reading 涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱, ハリー・ポッタと賢者の石、 時を掛ける少女、　マリア様が見てる,　灼眼のシャナ and two High School guide/textbooks on 漢文 and 物理. I have read some of 村上春樹 in translation before though. Japanese books are quite expensive here in Kinokuniya though, so I can&#039;t afford to buy some of the thicker mainstream fiction books too often.

I do have some &quot;visual novels&quot; on my computer though, like カノン, CLANNAD, fate stay/night, AIR, かな妹、月姫 and others of a less plot-heavy and more graphic nature.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It just turns out that I have the same words in my SRS as you do. heheh I have 広辞苑 in my 電子辞書 and I copy-paste from 大辞林 at the goo site, so I&#039;m pretty familiar with those two.

I agree with you about trad chars, but still, I was really thrown off when I saw 丰 for 豐 and 击 for 擊, as in I had no clue what they were supposed to be until I saw the TC.

Have you looked into 吉本ばなな or 村上春樹（むらかみ　はるき）? They&#039;re both pretty popular Japanese fiction writers, and I believe they&#039;re styles are on the easier side. I&#039;ve read some of their stuff, and it is interesting.

@khatzu

What dictionaries are you using? The Japanese one doesn&#039;t seem to be either 広辞苑 or 大辞林. The 中日辞典 looks to be the 小学館中日辞典第2版. That&#039;s the one I have, and it has the exact same example sentences that you have in your SRS. I see you aren&#039;t messing with the 簡體字 that the dictionary uses exclusively. Do you know those as well, or have you decided just to not deal with them?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@quend
&gt;Khatz, do you ever find yourself reading the Japanese pronunciation of a word in Chinese? 
Absolutely. Specifically, when some document starts with a long, unbroken string of kanji. Then I&#039;ll unconsciously read it in Chinese until I hit a kana and realize my mistake. For example, I was walking (I take lots of walks) on Thursday night, and saw a sign that said: &quot;交通安全&quot; (こうつうあんぜん), and I internally read it as &quot;jiao1tong1 an1quan2&quot;. It only happens when I already know the Chinese reading, though.

&gt;Is this intentional
Yes. It&#039;s because I was having trouble recalling the reading of 愚蠢 in other QA pairs, so I wanted to see it in as many places as possible. Also, if a sentence is really long, I often enter the original, whole sentence + most/all of its component clauses; this helps me get used to long sentences but provides some breaking-down so I&#039;m not overwhelmed with one big thing to remember.

&gt;BTW, can you recommend any good native Japanese fiction? 
I actually don&#039;t read a lot of fiction in any language, all my non-comics are non-fiction...but...I&#039;ll  let you know soon if I come across something good.

&gt;you used 清浦 奎吾 as a sentence. Just to learn the kanji?
清浦 奎吾 was a PM of Japan. I wanted to learn to read the character 奎...it&#039;s meaning was easy enough to remember that I haven&#039;t bothered learn it as a separate kanji. Furthermore, this is how I learn personal and place names.]]></description>

>Khatz, do you ever find yourself reading the Japanese pronunciation of a word in Chinese?<br />
Absolutely. Specifically, when some document starts with a long, unbroken string of kanji. Then I&#8217;ll unconsciously read it in Chinese until I hit a kana and realize my mistake. For example, I was walking (I take lots of walks) on Thursday night, and saw a sign that said: &#8220;交通安全&#8221; (こうつうあんぜん), and I internally read it as &#8220;jiao1tong1 an1quan2&#8221;. It only happens when I already know the Chinese reading, though.</p>
<p>>Is this intentional<br />
Yes. It&#8217;s because I was having trouble recalling the reading of 愚蠢 in other QA pairs, so I wanted to see it in as many places as possible. Also, if a sentence is really long, I often enter the original, whole sentence + most/all of its component clauses; this helps me get used to long sentences but provides some breaking-down so I&#8217;m not overwhelmed with one big thing to remember.</p>
<p>>BTW, can you recommend any good native Japanese fiction?<br />

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, do you ever find yourself reading the Japanese pronunciation of a word in Chinese? Like in your 1st sample, I read 膾炙 as kuai4 zhi4 immediately. Do you experience the reverse of that?

btw, I don&#039;t if you know, but 膾炙人口 is a　成語 in Chinese.

I notice you put 「這不是愚蠢是什麼？」 in 2 cards. One by itself and another in a longer sentence. Is this intentional? Or were they from two different extracts? If so, is the purpose to aid in understanding one sentence by itself?

BTW, can you recommend any good native Japanese fiction? Preferably science fiction or fantasy but anything is good.]]></description>
