					<description><![CDATA[This is good food for thought.  I have had my fair share of odd little encounters in Japan, but I also spent a few months in Vietnam, which was quite a bit worse in a way.  And yet, I still liked living in Vietnam in many ways and often miss it.  It&#039;s a matter of perspective.  Expats in Japan tend to inflate and gripe a lot about the xenophobia there, and yes it&#039;s true, but it&#039;s not the end of the world.  People get upset because they somehow expect things to somehow be different, and can&#039;t handle the discrepancy between reality and their expectations.  But for me, I just sort of realized that the world doesn&#039;t really owe me anything.  I&#039;m not entitled to anything.  So, I just enjoy what I can and roll with the rest.  It makes my time in Japan a lot easier.  This same advice would work just as well at home, given all the jerks who live there too (though we tend to treat them on an individual basis, not an ethnic basis).]]></description>
