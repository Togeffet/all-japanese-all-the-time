					<description><![CDATA[Interesting read.  I do have one complaint though.  Why in the hell do people try to copy Khatz&#039;s style of writing?  I enjoy Khatz&#039;s style but for me, it is unique to him.  For Tommy to take on that kind of style it just seems kind of lame.  And while I think that Tommy&#039;s advice was interesting and innovative, it was almost ruined by his &quot;Khatzness.&quot;

Just a tip from a fellow lover of this site.  You may have something useful to say and it is absolutley your right to do this, but know that if you lame it up by copying Khatz&#039;s style, then your message will be diminished (at least in my eyes, for whatever that&#039;s worth).  Yeah I know that was a run-on sentence like a mother fucker.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was brought up to respect my books. And by &quot;respect&quot; I mean: underline, highlight, annotate, and write comments in the margins. (And then pick them up years later and be able to actually find that quote I was looking for.) It makes me sad when I see students NOT doing this to their own textbooks.

One possible compromise is to find stories/articles online and print them out. Then you have both the &quot;pretty&quot; digital original and the useful annotated printout.

( IMO, though, the main down side of actually tearing up a book is that if you need to flip to a previous chapter or the index you won&#039;t have it with you. But it&#039;s a good idea for short stories or essay collections which can be broken into independent sections.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ha, nice conversation. I myself get free Chinese study aids from .... wait for it ... wait.... Free small business flyers! When people at crowded intersections hand out advertisements it doesn&#039;t hurt to take one. It helped with my cell phone vocab!

					<description><![CDATA[I just bought a non-fiction book from Kinokuniya the other day. I try to read it in between commutes, so I bring it everywhere with me. Since it&#039;s quite a bit above my level, I had to draw all over it, highlight words I don&#039;t know, and post-it the hell of it. 

I felt really bad after looking at how ratty it&#039;s become in just 2 weeks. I don&#039;t usually treat my English books this way. But this post made me feel so much better. Thanks, Khatz.]]></description>
