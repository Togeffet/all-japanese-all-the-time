					<description><![CDATA[I started my Dutch with lots of kid’s TV and for me, it was an excellent way to start.  They were short and a new programme would come on in 5 or 10 mins time. 
 
Also, like ahndoruuu, it was like a return to childhood.  My mindset wasn’t so concerned about understand all the words but about understand the storyline (easy with kids TV).  It didn’t bother me that the words were strange, as I saw it as an adventure and when words started repeating themselves, it was like ‘hey, there’s that word again, I wonder what it could mean’.  Eventually, I started associating these strange words with meanings.  It was fun and kinda magically.  Yes, it’s a given, that in Dutch this process is much quicker than in Japanese as it’s so much closer to English but I think it would’ve been much harder if I was focusing on the ‘meaning of words’ all the time.  

Excellent advice! Khatzumoto!  On Benny’s blog they were comparing children with adults, and who’s the best learners.  Most people said something like, yes, adults are quicker learners but they have to put in effort to learn a language. Buttt!!!  You can also learn effortless too!  If you put a little effort into building your language environment.  
I&#039;m coming to the conclusion that&#039;s this is perhaps the most important thing you can if you want to succeed in a new language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I guess so, But let&#039;s take 生クリームを混ぜる。　For example

Just following the heisig keywords, it turns out to be

Life/Living Creamをcrowdedぜる　

Just following the heisig keywords, who would have though that　生クリーム　Is &quot;Fresh cream&quot;　

Also 混ぜる、　The keyword is &quot;Crowded&quot; Right？But it really means to stir,mix。

That means, Living cream crowded　Just by keyword

Not ”Stir in the fresh cream&quot;

I see your point, But i honestly can&#039;t see it working for many situations, as it seems that many heisig keywords are not the most accurate to the actual meanings in most senses.

出る

Keyword is Exit, which it can mean sometimes　「出口」

But most of the time, it means something around the meaning of &quot;Putting out&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, what kind of question is that? Just because I don&#039;t like watching shows in a language I can&#039;t understand means I shouldn&#039;t be learning it at all?

I was merely stating that I need to find a way to have more fun watching shows in Japanese. No where did I state I was learning Japanese just to watch such shows.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Exactly what I do, Except every day I make it a little different.

In the morning I set my playlist With 30+ hours　Of movies, anime, and songs.　Listen to it through out the whole day　

・Shuffle of course, Want some variety :)

Then the next morning when I wake up, I modify it slightly then repeat.

But i always make sure my favorite episodes of ボンバーマンジェッターズ　Are on there, and never change it]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What about comic books like Batman or Superman? 

They aren&#039;t translated. I read them all the time. It&#039;s the only thing that I find impossible to turn into Japanese. I just read them while listening to Japanese though (actually skim through them is more like it, since I don&#039;t want to focus too much time on English).

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Frankly, I don’t really care what the story is. I’m just trying to get used to all of this new stuff. “Hey cool explosions.” “Hey cute/hot girls.” “Hey cool-looking guys fighting.” “Hey that was funny; I don’t know why but I’m laughing anyway.” Whatever yo.&quot;
THIS.  This, this, this.

The funny thing is, you&#039;ll find that language isn&#039;t actually necessary to get the gist of what&#039;s going on, in terms of character interaction at least. This also requires some skill on the part of the production.  If it&#039;s a bunch of people siting and talking without much emotion, good luck with that.  But that&#039;s a boring movie in any language.

Also, don&#039;t automatically assume your tastes will be consistent between languages.  In English, I love science fiction and crime shows and don&#039;t really care for sitcoms.  In Japanese, I&#039;m all about sitcoms and character drama.  YMMV.

Final tip:  if your reading is better than your listening, Japanese subtitles are extremely useful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[P.S. another thing that helps is to put all your movies/tv shows into a giant playlist and just have it playing all the time.  if they&#039;re actual dvds (hah) rip them :)  when you shift your attention to what&#039;s playing, just keep hitting the skip button until you hit something that can hold your interest at that point.  if you skip into a long video file, keep skipping a few minutes at a time through the video if need be.  screw continuity.  also screw trying to figure out what&#039;s going on unless you REALLY want to.  most of the time it&#039;s just a pain in the ass and makes you want to stop watching entirely and run back to englishland where things make sense.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to feel this exact same way.  What changed the experience for me was a realization.  I&#039;m not quite sure what the realization was, in that I can&#039;t verbalize it well, but basically when you&#039;re watching stuff in a language you barely understand/don&#039;t understand well, the entire experience is different.  I had to change the way I watched movies.  Rather than just kinda passively stare at the screen and let the story and dialogue over me, when I watch L2/L3 movies it becomes an opportunity just to people watch.  See how they act, their facial expressions, intonation, stuff in the background.  I&#039;m explaining this terribly but I kinda just take it like I&#039;m observing another world.  Frankly, I don&#039;t really care what the story is.  I&#039;m just trying to get used to all of this new stuff.  &quot;Hey cool explosions.&quot;  &quot;Hey cute/hot girls.&quot;  &quot;Hey cool-looking guys fighting.&quot;  &quot;Hey that was funny; I don&#039;t know why but I&#039;m laughing anyway.&quot;  Whatever yo.

From what I recall, this was kinda how I watched stuff when I was a kid.  I think one important AJATT principle is to, as much as possible, mentally return to childhood.  That has helped me more than anything else but it&#039;s such a personal thing and so hard to verbalize...which is, I think, why I haven&#039;t seen anyone else try to write about it.  But the way I see it is kinda like...each new language you learn is a chance to sorta relive childhood.  While your Chinese/Japanese/French/whatever self grows.  Luckily your other nationalities grow a lot faster than your native one. ^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know how you feel. I dislike watching things in Japanese because it&#039;s no fun. I&#039;ve been trying to get through Sgt. Frog in Japanese and I have to forcefully fight the urge to change the language back to English (FUNimation is great for having the Japanese audio, but it&#039;s so tempting to watch it in English :()

This is why I read things that I know I can only get in Japanese. Then I don&#039;t have to worry about wanted to read in English at least. But I like watching TV, so this is a big problem for me :(]]></description>
