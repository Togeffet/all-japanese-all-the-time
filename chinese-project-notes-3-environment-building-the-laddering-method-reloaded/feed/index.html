					<description><![CDATA[&gt;How much of those videos would you understand without subtitles?
This is kind of a tough question to answer, but I&#039;ll just give estimates. By the way, I&#039;m assuming you mean Chinese subs, since I don&#039;t use any foreign subs whatsoever. Since I&#039;ve seen almost all those videos in either English or Japanese like a million times over (I have sizeable tracts of dialogue of the Japanese &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; (TS) unintentionally memorized; &lt;em&gt;Powerpuff Girls &lt;/em&gt;(PPG) is also a victim of my repeat viewings on Cartoon Network), my understanding is essentially 100%. But of course, if I actually had to depend only on my present Chinese, I would not be able to follow the plot--10%-25% at best and probably less...much less. Since I know what&#039;s happening in those videos, I can just focus on sentence-mining--I don&#039;t have to figure out anything; I don&#039;t get confused about what&#039;s happening: I know WHAT people are saying, all I need to find out is HOW.

By the way, WITH subs my understanding jumps to like 25-40%. Since I know a lot of Chinese characters, subs really raise my game if they&#039;re turned on.

Anyway, these numbers are suuuuuuper fuzzy. Sometimes I understand a whole line of dialogue, sometimes I&#039;m totally lost, sometimes I infer stuff later on (I do a lot of inferring)...it really varies. Suffice it to say that I&#039;m still a Chinese language baby, which is precisely  why I&#039;m busting my butt so hard.
&gt;Are you able to have a conversation in Chinese?
A basic &quot;conversation&quot; about my family structure and the price of fruit in Japan, yes. A job interview? Politics? Even computer science? Not yet. Also, if the person speaks a slurring northen dialect, my ear is still not well trained for that yet.

Speaking of conversations, the other day, I telephoned a Taiwanese newspaper about getting a subscription from Japan...With electronic dictionary firmly in hand, I was able to fake my way through it, but I had the operator repeat herself quite a few times. Also, I found that I had this &quot;lag&quot; as I attempted to process what she way saying, it took me what seemed like several seconds to be like &quot;oh she&#039;s saying X-Y-Z&quot;. As it is, I avoid random speaking and writing and focus on input; I do parrot funny dialogue that I hear in movies and what-not...especially PPG and TS: &quot;別作夢!!!&quot;.

Speaking of faking your way through it--a lot of times, just &lt;strong&gt;pretending&lt;/strong&gt;/thinking you understand something actually helps you understand it.]]></description>
