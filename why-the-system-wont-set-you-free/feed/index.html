					<description><![CDATA[I think I finally get why I was feeling so burned out. My studying had turned into a rigid system: go do these reviews, go listen to Japanese music while coding and not other music, go to #AJATT Movie Night every Monday and Learn Japanese Through Music every Thursday (which was disappointing because I can&#039;t use a mic so I was always left out of karaoke)... Everything had become &quot;must do this, must do that&quot;. Tofugu&#039;s ebook says in one of the very first day-lessons that &quot;should do&quot; and &quot;must do&quot; are dangerous phrases, because you only have so many &quot;willpower trees&quot; per day, and gotta-dos use them up like a tree-punching Steve?.
¬†
So, I just let it all loose. The only &quot;should do&quot; now is &quot;should do SOMETHING Japanese every day&quot;, and the &quot;what&quot; is now &quot;whatever the heck I feel like doing&quot;. I still keep Anki and WaniKani at the top priority for &quot;consider doing these first&quot;, and anything else I just do if I feel like it.
¬†
(Also, I think the other thing Movie Night and LJTM were doing was making me feel bad about how much I suck at understanding spoken Japanese, and I know I need to get better, but I was looking too far up the echeladder when climbing the more reachable rungs will actually feel like progress instead of &quot;bluh bluh ÂàÜ„Åã„Çå„Å™„ÅÑÔΩûÔºÅ‚Äù.)]]></description>
