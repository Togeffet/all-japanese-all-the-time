					<description><![CDATA[You should be ok; as it&#039;s a real college course. I am in the Navy, taking courses at a college on my base in Yokosuka. The Japanese classes are not standard length, they are only right weeks long! WAY to short for a language course, and especially short for Japanese. Just keep doing life the AJATT way and you should be cool. And it&#039;s hard to balance still doing RTK reps, but I just mix it in for three minute sessions when I can. Good luck and keep up posted on how it&#039;s going!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just signed up for an Elementary Japanese class in college (because if given the choice to study Japanese or take a communications course, Japanese is way more fun for me) and I am now feeling pretty sh**y about it after hearing all these stories about how class is basically going to set my progress back. I really hope it&#039;s not as bad as it appears to be. My main motivation to finish Heisig soon is because I don&#039;t want class to halt my kanji learning progress. I guess I&#039;ll just try to make the most of it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I do believe that AJATT is vastly more powerful than class methods, because its success relies on intrinsic motivation rather than the application of sterile classroom approaches, I have had the opposite experience from Jack. I&#039;m studying abroad now, so Japanese immersion for me is higher than ever. Doing AJATT both in America and here in Japan has made Japanese class seem like a breeze. Students ask me for help, the teacher and I have nice conversations, and I find that almost everything we&#039;re tested on is something I&#039;ve already taught myself. RTK also makes kanji tests seem bogusly easy. I go to class knowing I have a secret advantage that few in this study abroad program, if anyone, understand. Win!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was quite fortunate with my uni - University of the Sunshine Coast also in Queensland, Australia. It was a really good starting block for my Japanese. Back in 2004 when I started learning Japanese I hadn&#039;t become aware of the AJATT menthod although in regards to kanji and hiragana I had started self teaching and using kanji whenever I could throughout high school. 

My uni however has an awesome sensei who - while teaching us from a textbook, could also see flaws and explain how it would be used naturally. Some of the other teachers were actually qualified to teach computers but because they were native Japanese speakers they taught us without really having spent time studying &quot;How to teach Japanese&quot;. As a result our lessons often fell off the textbook rails and we would instead spend 60 mins discussing how sake was made. Classes really did nothing for my listening abilities because aside from some stilted practice speaking we mostly ended up falling back into English. However in our own time one of our assessments was to keep a journal - we could do whatever we wanted to show the teacher how we&#039;d been attempting to learn Japanese outside of class hours. Of course we were recommended to try and expand on what we were doing in classes although it really wasnt a requirement. The requirement was effort. Our sensei encouraged our interest outside of the textbook. For me it was always kanji - never grammar. Also part of the course was a 10 month exchange in Japan. That&#039;s were I still contribute ALL my language skills to.... and not to the university over there either. 

It was my host family who taught me Japanese. 

I can track it to them because for the first 5 months I was in Japan I was failing exams, I couldn&#039;t order a freakin cheeseburger from maccas (Has anyone ever seen in ANY textbook the phrase &quot;ここでお召し上がりますか&quot; Honestly!? Try and go into a maccas and get the person behind the counter to speak in 普通形 ... 無理だよ！ They&#039;ll try bad English - but not plain textbook Japanese.... and you can hardly whip out your genki textbook and say - &quot;No ... you&#039;re now meant to say xxxx&quot;. But when I started living with my host family I could ask them what they actually were saying (even getting the sentence repeated is nigh impossible - they see gaijin and assume you cant speak Japanese). On top of that my host dad was the only member of the family who could speak any English and he refrained as I requested. I also started picking up Manga and with my trusty denshi jisho I started to improve. I still barely passed my Japanese uni exams - but fortunately my favourite sensei could see how much I was improving compared to the other girls (who kept speaking English with each other) and kept giving me multiple chances.

True immersion is the only way to learn.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jack,
I like that you said &quot;I’m not claiming that classes + AJATT doesn’t work, I’m claiming that classes don’t work.&quot; I&#039;d have to agree with you man. Before I discovered AJATT, I took an &quot;Elementary Japanese I&quot; course at a school here in Yokosuka. All I really took away was how to read and write Hiragana and a handfull vocabulary words. It was just too fast-paced to be able to learn. Since I discovered AJATT (and SRS; had no idea what that was till AFTER the class), I think my personal study time has greatly improved. I am always listening to music and watching Japanese TV; it&#039;s a great addition. I am going to take Japanese II here this fall (Class starts the 20th) and I will keep try to you guys up to date on how it goes this time.
Thanks again for sharing your story with us!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Old time AJATTer here, started in 2009. I had several issues as well at first but i was able to own the class in a little time. I enrolled the japanese course in october 2009 and by december 2009 even without having taken the exam yet i&#039;ve been moved by my teacher to the advanced japanese course. I just graduated and I&#039;ve been taken as the personal assistant of my mother tongue japanese teacher and right now I am about to begin teaching to first and second year students attending the undergraduate courses. That&#039;s a story of success, success that I&#039;d have never achieved without discovering AJATT.
Thanks to Khatz and everyone out there that kept my motivation high during these years. I am still learning tho!
みんな無理しないで頑張れ！

					<description><![CDATA[Okay, I just read that whole article. First off, this is mostly speculative. I do understand and perhaps even agree with the idea that adults probably will have a rougher time learning a language than a child, considering it&#039;s not something they&#039;ll need to survive. But that&#039;s why we make the environment and do our best to use English and immerse in English as -little- as possible while immersing as -fully- as possible in L2.

We create a new sense of necessity and somewhere in our subconscious is probably like &quot;Oh shiat, I really need to understand this Japanese otherwise I&#039;m going to be basking in nonsense and seem like an idiot and such.&quot; Furthermore, on a conscious level, we&#039;re enjoying the language and wanting to be part of it.

The study claims that we&#039;ll never be able to achieve true native-level fluency, which is bull. One of the star points they brought up was accent, which is merely a parroting act. Sure, some are a lot worse at mimicry than others, but those individuals just need to work harder at it (I&#039;m probably one of those guys).

And then, slightly besides the main point, they say it&#039;s not natural and that it&#039;s all hard work. Well, like Khatz/Antimoon/lots of people say, you&#039;re an adult with some sort of life and you&#039;re probably putting too much English or L1 into that life as opposed to L2. I&#039;d read the Momoko kid article. It&#039;s basically the point. Yes, a four year old doesn&#039;t have the &quot;disadvantage&quot; of knowing a language already, so there&#039;s the heightened survival aspect, but at the same time, a four year old doesn&#039;t know persistence and isn&#039;t very intelligent, either. Adults may have that &quot;disadvantage&quot;, but there&#039;s certainly an advantage in already knowing a language.

The other advantage is AJATT-style (or whatever precedes AJATT in this style) learning. You do what&#039;s fun and you do a -lot- of it. Repetition is the mother of learning, as the Russians say; but not rote memorization as the study-author seems to interpret it. Read any of the articles where it mentions doing small tasks frequently (and being immersed 100%) and doing those tasks consistently instead of assuming cram sessions will allow you to learn.

We&#039;re living in the greatest instant gratification period ever. So it&#039;s natural to assume with all the tools at our disposal we can learn anything quickly. But really, we just learn about things quickly. There&#039;s a veil that covers our eyes, hiding the true hard work it takes to accomplish anything great. (Read any of the posts that have Wayne Gretzky, Michael Jordan, the 1000m Kenyan runner [sorry, forgot his name])

Anyway, the study&#039;s perhaps not complete bollocks, but it&#039;d do you a wealth of good to take it with a grain of salt. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really love this post. I went to a class for about a month and a half when I first starting learning Japanese. I even has a Japanese tutor for 2 months. I quit the class because I didn&#039;t like where they put me(Although I was new at it, I watched and listen to whole lot of Japanese that I could&#039;nt bear listening to the many ways of saying &quot;hello&quot; and also I didnt like my class mates...seriously! One guy was married to a Japanese women ans went to Japanese on the reg, and still couldn&#039;t pronouce hajimemashite or sayonara...DORK!) 

But the reason why tried getting a Japanese tutor was so that I could feel like I went to school; I wanted to prove through a diploma or certificate that I could speak and read Japanese. So I got a tutor and something strange happened. We were speak in STRAIGHT JAPANESE THE WHOLE TIME! I did&#039;nt need the tutor, sure I learned what &quot;you ni&quot; means and how to use it in a sentance but everything else I knew already because I listened Japanese music and watched SANTAKU all day(Sanma and Kimura Takuya are HE-LAIR-E-US together!) My point is naturally Japanese is the better way to go when going for natural fluency. It has worked for me and it still is working. SRSing(when I am not lazy about it) has an interesting effect. Just like Jack, when you immerse your self and srs your self and really have FUN doing it, your brain is able to decipher kanji in a way that is shocking. I can read Japanese a figure out what is being said and what the context is. I think what is even more shocking is that this process gets better the more I read and listen to and watch and enjoy Japanese. 

Thanks for the post Jack, get your Japanese ON MAN. And Khatz, thanks for the site, it really helps.]]></description>

I quit the class because I didn&#8217;t like where they put me(Although I was new at it, I watched and listen to whole lot of Japanese that I could&#8217;nt bear listening to the many ways of saying &#8220;hello&#8221; and also I didnt like my class mates&#8230;seriously! One guy was married to a Japanese women ans went to Japanese on the reg, and still couldn&#8217;t pronouce hajimemashite or sayonara&#8230;DORK!) </p>
<p>But the reason why tried getting a Japanese tutor was so that I could feel like I went to school; I wanted to prove through a diploma or certificate that I could speak and read Japanese. So I got a tutor and something strange happened. We were speak in STRAIGHT JAPANESE THE WHOLE TIME! I did&#8217;nt need the tutor, sure I learned what &#8220;you ni&#8221; means and how to use it in a sentance but everything else I knew already because I listened Japanese music and watched SANTAKU all day(Sanma and Kimura Takuya are HE-LAIR-E-US together!) My point is naturally Japanese is the better way to go when going for natural fluency. It has worked for me and it still is working. SRSing(when I am not lazy about it) has an interesting effect. Just like Jack, when you immerse your self and srs your self and really have FUN doing it, your brain is able to decipher kanji in a way that is shocking. I can read Japanese a figure out what is being said and what the context is. I think what is even more shocking is that this process gets better the more I read and listen to and watch and enjoy Japanese. </p>
<p>Thanks for the post Jack, get your Japanese ON MAN. And Khatz, thanks for the site, it really helps.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Classes do suck. Often really really bad.
I&#039;m just saying they are not you problem right now. I know that because they are nobody&#039;s problem.
You are not responsible for them of for the million of people that still trust them and place their hope in them.
Following advice is no problem at all. As long as you never stop questioning it, as long as you don&#039;t stop questioning everything around you.
That&#039;s how you immunize yourself against classes of all kind, that&#039;s how your learn despite classes.
Maybe you are already doing that. You ARE on your way to fluency after all and you did find the solution to your problem, didn&#039;t you?
If that&#039;s the case rejoice, &#039;cause you haven&#039;t wasted a second of your life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I experienced the same. BUT like speaking tests i got full score, whereas in writing tests i got like 4/20. It was just like vomit the lessons. Boring lessons, i didn&#039;t go after some, because, really you know it, really really boring and useless. 
It was the same, and it&#039;s still the same in all the majors i&#039;m doing in Uni. I don&#039;t have best score in lessons tests, well each time the worst, but i have best score in &quot;researches&quot; and &quot;dissertation&quot; (dissertation as the french style exam, when you write what you think about a subject).
Learning by heart some grammar rules, learning the pronunciation of kanji out of context, is not for me. I&#039;m not a computer. Just give me a real Japanese text and i will read it to you. But more difficult are the tests, i mean like reading tests, better score i got when others just crammed for exams, and wasn&#039;t used to speak and listen real japanese. During my undergraduate, i chose always as speaking teacher a Japanese one (yeah in French Uni, you can choose your teacher), and the same for writing, i got really better scores with them as i spoke and wrote as (or approximately) a japanese guy. When I chose a French teacher, it was like i was a monkey, who can&#039;t even learn a single sentence by heart. Speaking is not learning by heart, it&#039;s filling heart by something. 
AJATT, or self-study is bad for undergraduate schools, but it&#039;s the best to really speak, write and in fact being good in any field. And the best when you will be in graduate school, if some wanna go there, well at least in French graduate schools.
Guys keep doing AJATT, and you will get the Grail! 
Well sorry for my bad English.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Nick, I didn&#039;t mean to come off as &#039;flaming&#039; classes per se. To be honest I wrote this email to Khatz in a rather angered state because I couldn&#039;t get the grade that I wanted. The anger came from a &#039;hating the bureaucratic system&#039; standpoint, where policy got in the way of kindness and leniency. I highlighted my strong points, and the teacher focused on my weaknesses, ignoring most things considered as &#039;development in my ability&#039;. My teacher wasn&#039;t native Japanese. In fact, she was Australian and made consistent use of English in the classroom when she couldn&#039;t explain something in Japanese.
 
I&#039;m not claiming that classes + AJATT doesn&#039;t work, I&#039;m claiming that classes don&#039;t work. I myself have done classes + AJATT and my natural language abilities have increased ten fold. I just think my progress was halted by classes, and that I could have done without them. I&#039;ve been in many different classrooms, with many different teachers, and not a single one of them has given me the right direction to improve my natural abilities. I&#039;m also not claiming that AJATT is the be all end all. I&#039;m just grateful for this cluster of ideas to be packaged up neatly into one resource.
 
From an economic standpoint, un-barred immersion is a much cheaper way to become fluent in a language than are classes. Classes also don&#039;t encourage you to change your life-style. Being fluent in multiple languages and maintaining the fluency requires rather large lifestyle changes, but that never seems to happen with school. School IS the lifestyle. Classes become your life.
 
I&#039;ve never had a teacher tell me to listen to Japanese music in my spare time.
I&#039;ve never had a teacher recommend a drama/anime or other T.V. show to me.
I&#039;ve never had a teacher who knew what an srs was.
I&#039;ve never had a teacher recommend I do something I would have done myself in my spare time anyway.
 
How can you say that the success in classes is not necessarily akin to fluency and then shoot down the AJATT immersion method? It is easy to blame failures on the class itself, but that&#039;s not exactly what I&#039;m doing. I&#039;m blaming my failures on the shallowness and limitedness of that study that I did do. It just so happens that the shallow/limited material was prescribed by the classes.

					<description><![CDATA[I thought the purpose of classrooms for adults was so you could get used to things like grammar.  My understanding, from the critical period hypothesis for L2 learning, is that adults have lost the ability to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; the grammar of a different language and need to have it explained to us, and even then we won&#039;t fully get it.  I have noticed an increasing number of people on the Internet denying this, however.

					<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with you Nick that I don&#039;t understand why so many people are so adamant about flaming classroom style teaching. Like you my teachers and TAs were all native speakers who never used English in class. MWF we had 1 hour conversation class and TTh were 1 and 1/2 hour grammar days. We had quizzes every day which meant that you would study for them outside of class. And yes, homework every day, and personally I found the homework very useful. Then we would have exams every 3 or 4 chapters and we had to write an essay that used a certain amount of learned grammar.

I don&#039;t know. Maybe I just excel at classroom learning. Teachers loved me, I was always number 1 in my classes getting 100% on every assignment, with few errors, and I was nominated the best student out of all the sections at my particular level. 

How did I do this? Yeah, by listening to directions. Instead of doodling in other classes I would write kanji over and over again. Vocab I would learn on the drive to school. And yeah, after college was over, I could live in Japan with no problem so I guess you could call me fluent. 

Am I just a good student? Maybe. 
But, not everyone has a bad experience with classrooms. In fact, I would love to go back and have a teacher guide me to improvement again.  

Now, it&#039;s 6 years later and when I got my masters in another subject I had to put aside my Japanese for fours years. Two years ago I started up again, this time studying on my own. I had to teach myself a whole new method of learning Japanese outside of the classroom. And neither one to me feels &quot;superior&quot;. They both feel right.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To Jack:

Leave language classes alone.

It&#039;s not classes your problem. They haven&#039;t done anything to you. Even if they did, nobody forced you to take them.

You wanted to learn a language, so you went to a language university and got yourself into a language course and did exams and all that. That&#039;s just reasonable.

You followed the methods that you were given. Reasonable, but that&#039;s what screwed you.

That&#039;s right! Because classes suck and their method sucks!

Yeah, right. No.

It&#039;s because you *followed* their methods. That&#039;s why you didn&#039;t learn.

You don&#039;t learn by following. You learn by leading. You learn by making choices.

That&#039;s kinda the point of AJATT. SRSing sentences is nothing more than another way to say: &quot;Write your own textbooks.&quot;

I learned english AJATT-style long before AJATT even existed. Khazt, as we say in Italy, &quot;invented hot water&quot; with his method.

I&#039;m glad you had a blast learning all the japanese all the time.

And I agree, classes suck. They really do.

But they are not your problem. It&#039;s following that held you back this whole time. That&#039;s what makes you feel like you wasted your time.

It&#039;s not school, your old master, the problem.
And your new master &quot;AJATT&quot; is not the way.

The Way is no-master.
Best of luck]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It boggles my mind that people like you insist on praising AJATT as the be-all, end-all method of language learning; it is a concept meant to be applied in practice. Why is it that when someone claims that AJATT + classes actually worked for some people, you insist on shooting it down as fallacy. Truth is, all classes are different, so it would do you a lot of good to realize that. A Japanese language class at my university was 4 days a week for 50 minutes-- and despite the fact they the professor used traditional classroom tactics (hw, oh no!), she was a native Japanese speaker from Kobe, and she insisted that we all practice writing and listening comprehension as much as possible outside of the classroom (sound familiar?). Classes impose a structure, whether you choose to abide by it or not-- but that structure is only in place for 50 minutes a day, 4 days a week-- that leaves you with roughly 165 hours in the week to do whatever you want with your Japanese. Just because classes attempt to guide you in a direction (that direction is based on the teacher) which may not have worked for you, doesn&#039;t give you the right to dismiss their success with others.

I understand that the success deemed appropriate in the classroom is not necessarily akin to fluency, but seriously, you shouldn&#039;t blame your failures in the classroom on the class itself. It&#039;s not hard to adhere to the structure of the class for the very limited amount of time requested. When people take language classes, they seem to think that they just need to do the work requested and nothing on their own time, then when they aren&#039;t fluent after 4 years they are angry and confused. Time to wake up buddy, class doesn&#039;t own your life, and it certainly doesn&#039;t follow you home and babysit you for 24 hours a day. Take the initiative.]]></description>
