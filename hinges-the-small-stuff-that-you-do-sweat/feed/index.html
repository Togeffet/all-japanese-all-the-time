					<description><![CDATA[Having Japanese T.V playing 24/7 is the surest, one-click-bang-(2 years later)-fluent strategy there is. So long as subtitles are displayed and are within vision, this just works. I&#039;ve had my T.V on during all waking hours so far during my stay in Japan and I really feel the progress.

I feel like I&#039;m a toddler who is aging at 12 times the speed (one month = 1 year), and I&#039;m now around 5 years old. Having said that, I&#039;m a toddler who understands the meaning of random things like... 細胞壁, but can&#039;t yet string it into a sentence. (昨日俺の細胞壁が壊れちゃった？困るうううう？）.. yeah, no.

Soooooon.....]]></description>
