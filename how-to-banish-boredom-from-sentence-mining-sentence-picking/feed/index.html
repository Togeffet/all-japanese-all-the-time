					<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto,

My second question in a day: do translations of western books into Japanese make good &#039;orchards&#039; for sentence-picking? My assumption is that, because translators from Japanese is the native language are doing the translating, the sentences will be &#039;good&#039; idiomatic Japanese. Is this assumption incorrect?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I experienced the same boredom with writing the Kanji (I know it&#039;s different, but that email reminded me of it). The tool on my computer for writing Kanji (IME standard) has a looong long list of Kanji based on how many strokes it takes to write it. I wanted to input a certain Kanji (that was an image file). So I would get to a moderately complicated one and think &quot;how many strokes&quot; and I would search through the list over and over, Kanji swarming all around me, and I would get really bored with it. And fast! Only 5 kanji and I was wiped out. Then I noticed you can draw the Kanji on another tab. It took a while for me to get the hang of the strokes, but it&#039;s so much fun and I&#039;m learning how to correctly write it along the way! If you don&#039;t stroke it right, the Kanji you have to choose from is completely different. Anyway, I&#039;m sure alot of people know this, but for any beginners out there, I highly recommend drawing the Kanji! You don&#039;t need great drawing skills or a tablet or whatever. And it totally beats picking Kanji out of Japanese websites and pasting them where you want to write xD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So to throw this out (not really related to Japanese but more related to linguistics that I learned in general)  

&quot;Anyway, I simply cannot fathom settling for foreignerness in any language; that’s just weaksauce.&quot;

There&#039;s a theory that&#039;s pretty simple called &quot;linguistic convergence/divergence.&quot;  Converging means to try and talk like the person you&#039;re talking to/divergence means you try and act really differently.  So a simple example in English would be like, an American and a British meeting and one of them would try and speak like/come closer to the accent of the other (converge), or they could make their accents a lot thicker (divergence).  My teacher talked about a French/Spanish (I could totally be making that up) actress who spoke Spanish as a child but always speaks with a French accent to stand out.  I doubt most people are consciously doing this though, and are unaware that they&#039;re doing it (when it comes to foreign languages at least) as they&#039;ve probably never considered the fact that they can obtain the same accent as a native.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[P.S.
Don&#039;t let anyone tell you it can&#039;t be done. They&#039;re generally trying to excuse their own failure. To put it more kindly, it just means that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; don&#039;t know a way. I&#039;m not trying to just give people hope here--actors do it all the freaking time. Anyone who makes the effort can. Pretend your life depends on it (but you also get all the practice time and materials you need), because if it did, by Billy you would find a way. Anyway, I simply cannot fathom settling for foreignerness in any language; that&#039;s just weaksauce.
P.P.S.
This is kind of a weird suggestion and I&#039;ve only done it some of the time, but, consider speaking your native language in the accent of the language you&#039;re learning. You should avoid speaking your native language at all, but if you must...twist it to your own ends.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ACT. It pretend you ARE from that country. Pretend you&#039;re that Jared kid from &quot;The Pretender&quot;, and that your life depends on you convincing people that you were born and raised in whatever country has native speakers of your language. Pick specific people (often, actors) to imitate and copy their mannerisms, look at the way their mouths are shaped, their hand gestures, the facial muscles they use. Be like a comedian doing impressions.

&lt;strong&gt;You stop being foreign when you stop believing you are foreign&lt;/strong&gt;, at least in terms of the language. Hold yourself to the same standard as a native speaker--if someone had to talk to you on the phone, they shouldn&#039;t be able to tell. Never fall for the excuse of &quot;oh, it&#039;s not my native language&quot;. You needn&#039;t be harsh on yourself, just always be looking for ways to improve.

I had a Japanese friend who self-taught English, and when I first met her I thought she was Japanese-American: it was that flawless. She told me she&#039;d watched a lot of TV and movies, and had changed the way she acted and used her facial muscles and shaped her mouth when making sounds.

So, &lt;strong&gt;input and imitation&lt;/strong&gt;. Input, because you have to hear a lot of examples not just of certain words, but certain COMBINATIONS or strings of words. Words change a bit when people shout, intonation changes based on emotion.

Also, pauses. Use the same pauses and bridges as native speakers. So, no &quot;um&quot; because  &quot;um&quot; is English, find the equivalents of &quot;um&quot; and &quot;uhhhuhhh&quot; in the languages you are learning.

What else...YES! I call it &quot;doping&quot;. In semiconductor production, doping refers is the process of deliberately introducing impurities into an extremely pure material in order to obtain better/desired performance properties. In learning a language, doping is the process of almost &quot;dumbing-down&quot; or de-streamlining your spoken language by introducing inefficient elements that have function but no meaning, and serve to make it more natural and native-like. You see, foreigners, tend to learn from texts and textbooks. And text is much, much more efficient (&quot;pure&quot;) than speaking. In text you get straight to the point:
A) &quot;This is an example&quot;. [4 words, 0 long pauses]
But in speech, you amble zig zigzag-zag toward your point:
B) &quot;Well, um, this is, like, an example or whatever...kind of, I dunno&quot;. [13 words, 1 long pause]
Native speakers are wasteful and inefficient. This is why the Borg in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; despise human communication. In my experience, native speakers use perhaps 2 or 3 times the number of words they &quot;need&quot;, and all that extra baggage has no lexical meaning. &quot;Um&quot; does not mean anything. &quot;Like&quot; does not really mean anything. It&#039;s all just filler.

Make your speech more native-like by making it more wasteful--I know, it sounds crazy, but it&#039;s the truth. If you speak too plainly, without any flavor, you come out sounding robotic or just foreign (often both). Also, the wasteful pauses can help buy you time when you need to remember a specific word--you do this in your native language, too--you don&#039;t remember a specific word or phrase, so you keep stringing words or phrases that are close to it in meaning and until you hit the jackpot. Examples:
A) &quot;Is it like a wiki or a blog, or, like a CMS or something?&quot;.
B) &quot;I&#039;ve never, like really had Japanese food, Or, I guess, been to a Japanese restaurant or whatever, at least on my own. I mean, I can, like, read the menu, but, um, you know, what&#039;s actually inside it--the stuff, you know, the food, the tendon or whatever...Is what I want to know?&quot;.
Not very good examples, but I think you get the point.

Finally, you want to swallow the words that native speakers swallow. For example, in Japanese, there is word:　雰囲気. Technically, it should be pronounced &quot;fun-i-ki&quot;, but native speakers swallow it and say &quot;fuinki&quot;; I say it the garbled, native way.

Oh, one more thing--pick an accent. The easiest to pick is the standard accent since it tends to have the most materials produced in it. Either way, pick a focus: pretend the people who speak that dialect are your parents and classmates--functionally, they are.

Finally (for real), try recording yourself now and then. It can reveal where you need work.

					<description><![CDATA[Wonderful advice, as usual! But I have a question that&#039;s not quite related to this post but I didn&#039;t see covered in your archives and that is the question of accents.

See, everyone is so discouraging when you learn a new language and say you&#039;ll always &#039;sound like a foreigner&#039; and this is a bit depressing. I realize that certain speech patterns are set and all that but what would be your advice and aquiring an authentic accent (Japanese or any other language)?

Thanks again!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the inspiration.  I like your action oriented method and your writing spurs me on.  I bought a book called kanji power many moons ago.  After I discovered Heisig, I stopped working with it and copying kanji over and over again.   Now I realize it&#039;s packed with 100&#039;s of rich sample sentences, most of which I like, and find useful.   When I need a break from reviewing I input new sentences and vice versa.   More results slowly day by day.   Now I feel I can use all the books that I purchased and really make them count.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[Right. Less deliberation, more action. Every moment we spend arguing is a moment we could have spent learning. This is why I quit visiting Japanese forums early on; the community is so busy with petty internal feuding (IN ENGLISH) that it’s forgotten why it was there in the first place.]

Oh, yes. I see this every day on writing forums. The best way to keep from achieving anything is to spend that time arguing with people who haven&#039;t achieved anything.

This is why I quit visiting Japanese forums early on; the community is so busy with petty internal feuding (IN ENGLISH) that it’s forgotten why it was there in the first place.]</p>
<p>Oh, yes. I see this every day on writing forums. The best way to keep from achieving anything is to spend that time arguing with people who haven&#8217;t achieved anything.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey khaztzumoto, do you know of any way to check for upcoming concerts in Japan? I&#039;m going to Japan in December and I&#039;m sort of planning to go for a concert or something. Regretably, I have no social network there at all, there are a few おばさん wives of Japanese expats where I&#039;m living but I have no friends living in Japan, should I stalk the おばさん達？]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;m in the beginning of the SRS thing.  What I&#039;m doing at the moment is to look up the English definition and the Japanese definition.  I&#039;m using Anki though and I really don&#039;t have any idea how to format it even though you&#039;re supposed to be able to.  But basically I make the Japanese I want to learn on one side of a flashcard, the Japanese definition and example sentence on the back side, and I have the reading show up at the bottom.  Then I have two cards which don&#039;t show up but I can look at if I need to, and those are where/when/who i heard it from and the English equivalent of a word so I can get an idea in the beginning.  But usually I&#039;m sticking to just the Japanese-Japanese which is getting in pretty quickly right now, so that&#039;s another idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[advisorbraid:

&gt;How do you know the proper reading for the kanji in the sentences if they have two or more with the exact same definition?
Well, in theory, you don&#039;t. You have to confirm with a third party. By the way, in that case, you would want to read it as &quot;ゆき&quot;. I could give you a rule of thumb for telling when to say いき or ゆき, but it&#039;s just based on my personal observation and I&#039;m not sure that it always works...I learned it case-by-case myself.]]></description>
