					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Take the guidance; good guidance is good. Copy good ideas. But don’t take commands.&quot;

True words. A lot of people don&#039;t realize the difference. I remember once being called a sheep because I read personal development books, the same person also said I was a sheep for watching movies by specific directors, proudly stating &#039;I don&#039;t care who directed it&#039;
Yet, those words were not their own, and that sentence has been said many times by many people.
If you&#039;re speaking a language spoken by other people, you&#039;re a copycat, you&#039;re not &#039;thinking for yourself&#039;  If you&#039;re watching something seen by others or reading something read by others, you&#039;re not doing anything unique. After all:

&quot;It’s not like I cook food that’s never been cooked before, made from ingredients that didn’t previously exist&quot;

So yes. I&#039;m a copycat. Our existence is the result of copycatting, so our creation was nothing creative. 
To say someone is not individual for using something they did not create is like saying to a cat &#039;you&#039;re not the only one to use a litter tray, you know?&#039;]]></description>
