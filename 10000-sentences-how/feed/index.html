					<description><![CDATA[A lot of people have difficulty finding sources of sentences for 10000 sentences. I&#039;ve been using 10000 sentences to learn German, and it&#039;s very time consuming to manually enter all the data, so I have developed a tool which can help you to quickly find useful and interesting sentences for your chosen language using data from Tatoeba.

It&#039;s called TaToTen (Tatoeba to Ten Thousand sentences) and it helps you generate a sentence file rapidly (I add around 500 new sentences to my list in under an hour). When you have chosen your sentences, you can download the file to use with your favourite SRS tool.

You can try it out here : http://tatoten.com/
