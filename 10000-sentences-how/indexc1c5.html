		    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>@Update: 10,000 Sentences is Dead. Let the MCD Revolution Begin! | AJATT | All Japanese All The Time <a href="http://is.gd/AWLzAv" class="autohyperlink">is.gd/AWLzAv</a></strong></span></p>
<p>10,000 sentences is a lot. But the way we’re doing it, you can easily learn about 50 every day no sweat, and even more if you want to. Don’t freak out if you only do 15-25 every day. The important thing is to learn every day.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing device(s) (PC, electronic dictionary, PDA, etc.)</li>
<li>An SRS (<a href="../category/khatzumemo/index.html">KhatzuMemo</a>, <a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/">Mnemosyne</a>, etc.)</li>
<li>One or more sentence sources (dictionary, movies, music)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to have <em>learned</em> a sentence you need to be able to do 4 things:</p>
<p>1. Read it in full, aloud, with kanji, no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana">furigana</a>.</p>
<p>Furigana are great for when you’re reading comics and such, and I heartily recommend you use books that have them, but you need to learn to function without them.</p>
<p>2. Know the meaning of every word in the sentence.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t suggest you over-analyze the sentence, but you should know the function of each part of the sentence, otherwise you can&#8217;t truly be said to be understanding it. You <em>don’t</em> need to provide an exact translation when you give your answer, in fact, don’t bother translating at all. Of course, early on, you will be using Japanese and English together (later, Japanese only), and you will need probably get translations of the sentences, so put those translations in the &#8220;answer&#8221; field of your SRS; use them as a check of your understanding. But again, you just need to remember the <em>gist</em> of the translation (not the exact wording) for it to count as <em>knowing</em> the sentence.</p>
<p>3. Understand the meaning of the entire sentence<br />
4. Write (copy) out the sentence by hand</p>
<p>This is so you get practice writing Japanese &#8212; you don&#8217;t have to do this for every sentence, but do at for as many as you can. You should do this on graph paper (one square per character). If you have no graph paper around, do without until you get some. By our definition, <strong>if you cannot do any one of these 4 things, then you have not learned the sentence. </strong>Notice how:</p>
<ul>
<li>This does <strong>not</strong> involve looking at an English sentence and translating it into Japanese. Do not translate from English to Japanese. Why? Well, because there are so many possible translations for a given sentence, how are you going to say which is right and which is wrong? Are you only going to count the one you’ve got written down? That’s too restrictive and too failure-prone. What’s more, if you get the Japanese sentence wrong, you haven’t just made a mistake, you’ve sown the seeds of bad Japanese. <strong>Good Japanese starts with mindlessly imitating good Japanese</strong>. Don’t go inventing your own Japanese; no one will understand you. You’ll be doing the Japanese equivalent of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">all your base are belong to us</a>” (<a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us">Japanese discussion of the same</a>) “全ての貴方のベースは私に属する”. It sounds weird…off.</li>
<li>Nor does it involve saying or writing the sentence from memory. <strong>Do not memorize the sentences</strong>. That’s too complex and too failure-prone. If you’re like me, you can barely memorize words, let alone sentences.</li>
</ul>
<p>“But wait, if I don’t memorize it, how do I know I know it?”. Oh-ho. That’s where the SRS comes in. When you first learn a sentence, of course you’ll “remember it”. What counts isn’t so much that first time, as 2, 3, 10, 52 weeks later. Thanks to an SRS, you will be given the chance to truly test your knowledge, by reading that sentence several times over several weeks and months. By doing that successfully, that sentence will be in your brain, pretty much like white on rice. In other words <strong>you will memorize the sentence just by seeing and reading it repeatedly over time</strong>. The SRS will take care of things to make sure that you see new sentences or sentences you keep forgetting, more often than old sentences that you know well.</p>
<p>Seeing and reading things repeatedly over time is just how advertising works; you can remember sentences like “You can’t beat the feeling”, some 15 years after Coca-Cola stopped even using that slogan. It’s also how it is that you can memorize the words of an entire movie (<em>Independence Day,</em> anyone?) But, yes, it takes time, and for a while you don’t believe you’re learning because you (apparently) have nothing to “show” for it. This is part of why classes are so bad. Classes are generally too focused on output—on display—but not on what is really going on inside.</p>
<p>So, even though just being able to read short sentences aloud is so <em>easy</em>, you <strong>are</strong> learning. Recently (October 8, 2006), I had to stand before a Japanese audience and read aloud some documents that I had never seen before （祝電＝しゅくでん）, and it was no problem at all; I can read the same as your “average” adult in Japan, and I’m not smarter than you.</p>
<p>While you will eventually memorize a lot of the sentences, you will almost certainly not memorize all of them. But if you were to hear or read them (or sentences similar to them), you would understand them. This is important. Why? Well:</p>
<ul>
<li>In every language you speak, your passive vocabulary (what you understand) always outstrips your active vocabulary (what you say/write)</li>
<li>It is generally far for more important to <em>understand</em> other people, than to make yourself understood. It’s fine if you can ask for directions, but if you can’t understand the response…might as well take the next train to Whatsthepointville. More broadly—the simple fact that you are outnumbered 1 to several billion, means that you’re going to spend much of your life <em>receiving input</em>;; there are more people, books and videos than there are of you. If you are to function as an independent, mature adult in any society, then it is imperative, I mean, really, really, important, that you fully understand the written and spoken input of the world around you.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, remember <strong>input precedes output</strong>. ALWAYS.</p>
<p><strong>Readings</strong><strong> of Kanji</strong></p>
<p>As you know, in Japanese, a single kanji generally has two pronunciations (readings), sometimes less, sometimes more. Something that this method implies is that readings of kanji will take care of themselves just in the sentences you read. You don’t need to go learning the readings separately—learning things completely out of context like that has always been too boring, meaningless and ineffective, at least for me. Learning to read aloud thousands of sentences you will eventually get the feel for when to use which reading in any given situation. And you will also learn the exceptions; and there are plenty of exceptions. Not only that, but learning kanji readings in the context of a sentence is just <em>easier</em>—perhaps because a sentence connects everything in it with some rhythm or meaning. I don’t know the real reason just like I don’t know why electromagnetism works, but I know that it’s effective.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>Look at these examples of sentences in the typical question-answer (Q-A) form flashcard. Note that the answer is not always necessarily the full “answer” that you give, it’s more a clue—definitions of words, etc.</p>
<p>QUESTION (FRONT):</p>
<blockquote><p>これは例文です。</p></blockquote>
<p>ANSWER (BACK):</p>
<blockquote><p>これ　は（わ）　れい・ぶん　です。<br />
This [as for] example-sentence is. (PL3)<br />
*This is an example sentence.</p></blockquote>
<p>QUESTION (FRONT):</p>
<blockquote><p>お前は何者だ？</p></blockquote>
<p>ANSWER (BACK):</p>
<blockquote><p>お・まえ　は（わ）　なに・もの　だ<br />
おまえ【御前】同等または､目下の相手をゾンザイに､また親愛の情を込めて呼ぶ語｡<br />
現代では､多く､男が使う｡対等の親しい関係では｢おれ｣に対し｢お前｣と言う｡<br />
なにもの【何者】姓名･身分などの分からない者を指していう語｡どういう人｡だれ｡何人(ﾅﾆﾋﾞﾄ)｡｢昨日の君の相手は何者かね｣。<br />
めした【目下】地位または年齢が自分より下であること｡また､その人｡</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Update: I&#8217;ve made some major improvements to this, discussed </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="../chinese-project-notes-8-ch-ch-changes-stuff-that-applies-to-japanese-too/index.html">here</a><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span></p>
<p>Observe the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The direction is <strong>from</strong> Japanese only.
<ul>
<li>Initially you can go Japanese-to-English, but eventually, you should start going <strong>Japanese-to-Japanese only</strong>. For me, this was at about 500-1000 sentences. The effect of using only Japanese to discuss Japanese is pretty phenomenal; it’s like your Japanese becomes a self-sustaining reaction. You will probably have to do a lot of looking up, such that your answer area may contain definitions of definitions. That’s super! Because everything you are doing is exercising your Japanese skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s important to either access to an Internet dictionary or a software dictionary installed on your computer. That way, you can look up at the push of a button. A paper dictionary is fine for browsing, but for looking up an actual, specific word, it is BMT: brutal, medieval and time-consuming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>
<p>It would be nice if the sentence idea were my own, but the truth is that it belongs to a small group of Poles who learnt English to native-level fluency before ever leaving Poland. They even built a website about their work in learning English. The great thing about their site is that what’s true for learning English is largely true for learning any other language, including Japanese. Warning: I heartily encourage you to read their site. But unfortunately, while a former <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/">SuperMemo</a> user/evangelist myself, I cannot recommend the SuperMemo software as they do. Fortunately, there are similar programs out there that do what SuperMemo does, for free. One of those is <a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/">Mnemosyne</a>.</p>

                        <p>OK, Katsumotosama, I get the idea.  Input, yes.  Books, movies, yes!  Here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m stymied (from a sentence on the AntiMoon site).  How do you decide which sentences from your input to copy over to your SRS?  Not every one, surely!  Of course.  You don&#8217;t need a bunch of sentences of the form &#8220;Hon da.&#8221; &#8220;Pen da.&#8221; &#8220;Jitensha da.&#8221;  Is there no other suggestion than &#8220;pick the ones you like&#8221;?  Maybe &#8220;pick the sentences that you might like to repeat someday&#8221;?  Or that say something like something that I might like to say.  Or understand if said?  Can you talk about that aspect of 10,000 sentences?</p>

a new beginning!!  There&#8217;s so much I want to say but I&#8217;ll limit it to a comment about the post.<br />
I want to write sentences to learn but I have a few questions before I start.<br />
1)  Where do you get the sentences?  (internet, etc?)<br />
2)  Do you make example sentences for grammar points or just vocab?<br />
3)  I have a decent level of skill, do you think I should jump into the J-to-J cards?</p>

                        <p>>how do you manage to memorize the kanji readings and stuff?<br />
1. Learn the reading of each kanji as it used in the sentence. So, rather than learn all the readings of a given kanji, learn the one reading that is being used *in this case*&#8211;in the sentence at had.<br />
2. Add that kanji reading to the &#8220;answer&#8221; section of the SRS.<br />
Note:<br />
(i) A sentence has a kind of rhythm to it that will actually make the reading quite easy to remember, generally speaking. Certainly, it will be easier to remember than an isolated kanji reading.<br />
(ii) Also, be sure to use SHORT sentences to begin with, don&#8217;t overwhelm yourself. Something like 「テレビを見る。」 or 「夕食の支度をする。」 or 「慌てて登校する。」　is a good length.<br />
(iii) Use sentences that have multiple parts of speech. What I mean is, you want nouns, verbs and adverbs/adjectives all in there.</p>
<p>Remember, in order to say you &#8220;know&#8221; a sentence, you need to:<br />
1. Understand the meaning of every word in the sentence<br />
2. Be able to read the sentence correctly ALOUD (i.e. know the reading of every kanji in the sentence)<br />
3. Know/understand the meaning of the sentence as a whole. Not just &#8220;sort of understand&#8221;, but REALLY understand what is meant, and the context in which it was/is being used.<br />
4. Write it out [no need to write it out from memory, you can just copy it down, but DO write it; this is to get writing practice; this is important because no matter how well you&#8217;ve memorized kanji via Heisig, if you stop writing them, you willl start to forget; using a computer, it&#8217;s too easy to stop writing. Never let a day go by where you don&#8217;t fill two A4/letter-size pages with normal-size kanji. In all likelihood, you will be more proficient at writing kanji than most adults in Japan currently are, and that&#8217;s fine.].</p>

                        <p>I have a question. i do hope you can provide me with an answer.</p>
<p>what if the word has multiple meansings?  for example in your example above 夕食の支度をする, the word 支度 has a couple of meanings according to Yahoo 辞書: <a href="http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?p=%E6%94%AF%E5%BA%A6&amp;enc=UTF-8&amp;stype=0&amp;dtype=3" class="autohyperlink">dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?p=%E6%94%AF%E5%BA%A6&#038;enc=UTF-8&#038;stype=0&#038;dtype=3</a></p>
<p>in this case it is clearly the first meaning, but should the other meanings be added as other cards so you are more, fully aware of the words uses?</p>

<p>keep up the good work!</p>
<p>i appreciate the &#8220;starter packs&#8221; of sentences, but would it be rude of me to ask for a sample mnemosyne file with some more examples? i would like to get a better idea of what to include in an ideal card. I personally study J &#8211; J but the cards I make are a little different. I include a definition and example sentences with the word I am wanting to review blanked out on the question side. e.g:</p>
<p>二つの物の間に差がある。ちがっている。<br />
「兄弟でも性格は―・る」</p>
<p>then on the answer side the word i am wanting to study and it&#8217;s synonyms:</p>
<p>異なる<br />
→違う［用法］</p>
<p>this method is a little different to the one that you use, so i am wondering if i should switch over to including the definition on the answer side and actually include the word I want to study in the example sentence on the question side. doing so would mean that I would be studying much more passively (as in i will not have to actively &#8220;fill the gap&#8221; with the word that I want to study). This seems to be the main focus of your method and the one described on Antimoon &#8211; input, input, input and it seems to work for you guys. having extensively reading the Antimoon website, I realized that learning a word in context means that the whole sentence where it was first seen is remembered as a sort of block showing how the word connects to other words and so can clearly see that using the sentences-method works, I am just working over the fine details of SRS at this point in time.</p>
<p>keep up the good work, </p>

<p>Regarding your sentences, where did you find the politeness levels that you use. I would love to add that to my card deck consistently.</p>

I made them up (set them myself). The origin of the PL system is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0834804522?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=alljapanallth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0834804522" rel="nofollow"><em>Mangajin&#8217;s Basic Japanese Through Comics</em></a>. Even if you don&#8217;t stick a PL on all your items, you&#8217;ll naturally pick up what the register of a sentence is.</p>

                        <p>What would you suggest for a person at my level?  I have lived in Japan for 14 years and for most of it focused almost solely on conversation.  In many ways I was successful, but knowing what I know now, I wish that I had started differently  The handicap of not being able to read and write very well was a thorn in my side, but now I am on the way to remedying that.  I have learned all 3007 kanji that Heisig has in Book 1 and Book 3.  Skipping Book 2,  I decided to learn the key onyomi of each of the first 2000 in the frequency list because onyomi are generally used for compounds.  Have just finished learning those onyomi as well.  Using an SRS has truly been a wonderful help.  Was planning on  attacking vocabulary next to bring myself up to around JLPT Level 1 vocabulary proficiency.  Actually not planning  to take the test (no need at the moment), but just thought it might be a good goal to set.  Just came upon your site this last week and have been captivated by your approach of 10,000 sentences.  Much better than learning vocab by rote which I never felt peaceful about.  Wish I would have found it before all the onyomi learning (though I can&#8217;t say that it has been a waste because my reading ability has increased immeasurably) or 14 years ago for that matter.  Where am I now?  I have high listening comprehension and most people who speak with me think I am essentially fluent (I know better but am able to communicate  effectively on basicly any topic).  When I read, I am confronted with my shortcomings in vocabulary as well as when I watch more complex news items on TV.  Because of Heisig and the onyomi I learned, I can read basically all the vocabulary I already know but if you asked me to write a large majority of the words I know with their correct kanji I would be at a loss since speakng has been my life so far, not writing.  Of course I can get by with my computer, but I don&#8217;t want crutches anymore!   So, I want to learn new vocab as well as know how to write the words I already know.  If you were in my position, how would you approach the next step?  Sorry for this long rambling message!  Thanks for the inspiration!</p>

                        <p>Hey kurojohn,</p>
<p>I would suggest&#8230;you keep going with sentences; I think it applies as much to your case as it does to a complete beginner. Choosing sentences is/can be a very personal thing. </p>
<p>Focus on your weak points. Work on what needs working on, and ignore what doesn&#8217;t. Always be looking out for what you DON&#8217;T know, what you CAN&#8217;T (yet) read or understand or say; find holes to plug. Maybe you can read 羨 in 羨望, but can you read it as 羨ましい? Things like that&#8230;</p>
<p>Always have a Japanese book with you. For travel, get books with furigana (I recommend books for kids around 小6, since these have tons of kanji but all with furigana because they&#8217;re cutting the kids slack for being 小学生) so you don&#8217;t have to bother look up readings; for home, get books without furigana so you can find your weaknesses. Do things you like, watch movies you like, but do it all in Japanese. Keep away from English; if you have bilingual acquaintances steer them to Japanese (even if they speak English, pretend that you don&#8217;t). Et cetera! Hope that helps&#8230;</p>

                        <p>so, i decided to start the sentences thing yesterday. i think its a great idea! i already memorize vocabulary from j to e only, and i notice that i definetly know the word the other way around when i need it. i started with the <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/" class="autohyperlink">www.guidetojapanese.org/</a> example sentences and am working my way through the ones that i like. i am not quite sure where i will go after that, but thats not the point. my question is that it seems like sometimes i remember the meaning of the word, because i have read the sentence before (when entering it for example) is this ok? do i count this as full recall and trust that the srs will make everything stick?</p>
<p>anyways, thanks a bunch for your website! i dont think i could learn japanese as hard core as you did, but i think that you have alot of great suggestions that i will apply to future studies. 🙂</p>

                        <p>&gt;Sorry, I’m not understanding the question 🙁 . But, if you remember something. then, yes, it’s a recall.</p>
<p>eh, what i mean is: for example suppose i have 「これは魚です。」but i dont remember what 魚 means. but then, i remember adding/seeing the sentence, &#8220;this is a fish&#8221; and then i remember that the kanji is さかな &#8230; should i try not to do this? or is this how its supposed to work.</p>

                        <p>As long as you recall it from your own memory, that counts. Since it sounds like a slow recall that required some figuring out, I&#8217;d give it a &#8220;3&#8221; in KhatzuMemo/Mnemosyne/SuperMemo.</p>

                        <p>I think I know what O is talking about. When my collection of sentences was low, I tended to remember the meaning of the sentence by the people / things involved, rather than reading the sentence and inferring the meaning from it.</p>
<p>At one time, the only sentence I had which mentioned Mr Yamamoto had him kicking balls to Mr Ito. When I saw Mr Yamamoto come up during review, I simply remembered his inclination to kick balls before having a chance to read the whole sentence. But after that name was used in different sentences and in different situations, the reliance on that kind of memory quickly became&#8230; not so useful. 🙂 &#8220;Ahhh yes, Yamamoto likes to drive cars across bridges now!&#8221;</p>
<p>It still happens occasionally though, 川口さん is still the only 政治家 I know at the moment, but I guess pumping in more sentences will sort them out too.</p>

                        <p>Hi</p>
<p>Love the site. Not learning Japanese though (sorry!) &#8211; I&#8217;m learning Chinese and am pretty much a beginner. My question is about sentences. I&#8217;m keen to go Chinese &#8211;&gt; Chinese on sentences pretty much as soon as possible, but I worry about the &#8220;question&#8221; element of my flashcards. I am worried that I&#8217;ll invent a question which is pretty much communicates what I want to gt across but for one reason or another is grammatically incorrect. This worries me because if I see it regularly I know I will remember it &#8211; and I will remember it wrong. Have you got any tips for this?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really sorry if the answer to this is obvious from your samples above but I can&#8217;t read Japanese!</p>
<p>Thanks, Nicky</p>

Yeah, don&#8217;t bother memorizing it&#8230;It&#8217;s too stressful, and it will slow you down. You will &#8220;memorize&#8221; it naturally through multiple exposures.</p>
<p>>then I’ve learnt it?<br />
In a sense, you have. The moment you can read it out loud and understand it, then you have learned it. Thereafter, the key is to RETAIN that knowledge. That&#8217;s where an SRS comes in.</p>

                        <p>Yes :D.<br />
Of course one can also use sources that already have readings given (and this might save time, especially early in the process), but the lack of furigana shouldn&#8217;t preclude the use of any source.</p>

                        <p>good day, i just found this site and i feeling the approach you use a good one and want to implement it, now of course i have a question 😉</p>
<p>i have long wanted to get some simple books to read, like child books with furigana, could you tell me how you bought them?<br />
ideally I&#8217;m looking for a Japanese (second hand)online book store where you can order a decent amount in once and save on shipping and handling.(and be able to use paypal)</p>
<p>i know I&#8217;m asking for something hard, but any help would be appreciated, for now i ordered remembering the kanji(i got the pdf but like books beter)<br />
kind regards ivo</p>

                        <p>Khatzu,</p>
<p>This article, bar none, is what has been keeping me going the last two months. For that time, I&#8217;ve been trying to finish RevTK (upto 1700 now) while looking for all sorts of ways to build up my sentences.</p>
<p>My sources for now are: Pimsleur (the introductory conversation of each lesson), Genki, Japanese for Everyone, JLPT Study site, NHK Brush up on Japanese. </p>
<p>For sentences I&#8217;ve gotten from conversation samples, I try to include one sentence from both speakers. Usually it&#8217;s QUESTION [speaker a: question, speaker b: answer] ANSWER [pronunciation and explanation if necessary]. Prior to that, I was doing one sentence each, but began feeling I was not getting the context for the shorter sentences. Other than that it&#8217;s been simple sentences.</p>

                        <p>Hi Charles A.<br />
    Sounds like you have a bit of the same issue I have.  Before I started Khatz&#8217;s method, I had acquired TONS of Japanese books; always thinking that each one was the perfect book.  So I have many of the same books you have.  Anyway, are you using just sentences from the conversations samples or other parts of the text.  Also, have you been trying not to repeat target phrases from book to book?  And how, oh how does one keep track (the books present info in different order).<br />
   I think Khatz mentioned mining for sentences but not this specifically, I think.  I&#8217;d love to mine all my old text books and get rid of them.  Care to weigh in, Khatz?</p>
<p>And Khatzumoto, thank you so much for the site (and the answer to my last comment)!!</p>

                        <p>Charles A,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just doing it one step at a time and changing strides and paths as I see fit. Since I&#8217;m still in the Learn Kanji phase (though nearing the end), I&#8217;m taking it slow on the sentences. Right now I&#8217;m doing Pimsleur (which has NO written material provided), so I&#8217;m using the introductory sentences which is only 3 to 5 samples per chapter. </p>
<p>For the sentences from the books, I think that I can use the conversation samples and the other examples given in the chapter. For the conversation examples, it does seem important to get both speakers sampled in the same card. I&#8217;m not even going to stress if stuff is getting repeated. It feels like you&#8217;re going to look at a sentence and tell yourself &#8220;why do I care about that, I know that already&#8221; and ignore it as time goes on. Probably why it&#8217;s important not to bulk add 2000 sentences via an Excel spreadsheet. Just look at what you&#8217;re adding for the day and make the call. I&#8217;m not the best guy to ask for advise cause I haven&#8217;t even started yet. You could say I&#8217;m just getting my game plan together.</p>
<p>Khatumoto,</p>
<p>No problem there. Rosetta is starting to bore me and I haven&#8217;t even started yet. Still, I&#8217;ll keep it around for now just to see if Anki + Rosetta = Rapid vocabulary in long term memory. I&#8217;m just going on the assumption that creating a large pool of passive vocabulary will not be a bad thing. Besides that, yeah, if it gets boring.</p>

                        <p>Thanks guys,<br />
  I think you hit it, Charles.  Mine for as many sentences as possible and try not to repeat.  I seem eternally stuck in the learn Kanji phase (yes, I&#8217;m a multiple time three day monk in that respect).  So to switch it up, I&#8217;m looking to finally finish RTK and while cherry picking sentences.  I think the key the Katzumoto keeps stressing and I agree, is to stay entertained and focused.<br />
  As for Rosetta.  I used it for a while and it got really boring.  I think if you use it with Anki, like you mentioned.  That would be a good strategy.  Not sure if you can, but cutting and pasting the stuff, would be a good way to minimize the SRS input time.  </p>
<p>@Katzumoto.  I agree.  Keep moving until I get bored.  I did rip the Japanese audio from Old School (the Will Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson movie) and I can&#8217;t get enough of it.<br />
I enjoy listening and can follow it pretty well.  </p>
<p>Thanks all and ganbatte!!</p>

                        <p>Rmss,</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m getting more into the sentence phase of AJATT, the less attractive Rosetta Stone looks. Yes, I&#8217;m still in the process of developing a spreadsheet so that anyone can use it in conjunction with the photos and audio. Basicly, it&#8217;s take the Romaji located in a .txt file with all the photos, convert that to Kana via a website I use, then use JWPce to convert the Kana into the correct Kanji going picture by picture in Rosetta. Takes about 3 hours per unit so I&#8217;m only upto unit 3 (19 in all). Thing is, going picture by picture, I&#8217;m seeing that there&#8217;s not much meat to the sentences. Yeah, you&#8217;ll get ALOT of vocabulary in context with Kanji which is nothing to sneeze at. The other thing is, no one has told me if what Rosetta presents is good information. Am I picking up way too many bad habits with their choice of sentence structure?</p>
<p>As for using the program: Remember that SRS helps you retain what you already learned. If you use Rosetta&#8217;s guided exercise, you&#8217;ll definately have learned something by the end of the lesson. Then just add that lesson to the SRS and keep it up. By the way, if you do a lesson a day (40 photos) I think you&#8217;ll find your SRS will smooth out to about 60 reviews a day. I&#8217;m thinking for that part, just go Kanji sentence to photo (with kana pronunciation and audio if you can pull that off). The reverse is not necessary. In addition, think about mining real sentences to compliment.</p>

                        <p>Hey Khatz</p>
<p>A quick question when you get back from your break.</p>
<p>When I started using my SRS, I entered the English sentence in the question field and the Japanese translation in the answer field. But after reading your method on this site, I no longer try to translate &#8211; as you say, this is too failure prone, so now I just put the Japanese in the answer field and leave out the translation.</p>
<p>The only concern I have in doing this is that I am not actively using my brain to come up with the sentence I want to say &#8211; I am just reading a sentence that has already been created. It seems like the easy way out. It&#8217;s like for example asking somebody to write a Japanese email for you and you may understand it perfectly BUT you would have learned and retained a lot more if you had gone through the thought process by writing the email yourself. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense?! </p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Mark</p>

                        <p>&#8220;Something that this method implies is that readings of kanji will take care of themselves just in the sentences you read.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I haven&#8217;t searched carefully enough, but in yahoo dictionary (and most of the other dictionary sources) the example sentences have nothing like furigana, no way to tell which way the kanji is read.</p>

                        <p>Zodiac: a great solution to that problem is Rikaichan. Download that for free, and then you&#8217;ll be able to hover over the reading of any kanji and get it immediately.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m not so sure about Rikaichan. Maybe I downloaded an older version but the fact is that I&#8217;m not getting the right readings for some compounds. For example: 慰霊碑 should be read いれいひ but rikaichan gives いれい to the first two kanji and for the last gives いしぶみ.<br />
The same with 疾風伝(しっぷうでん). Normally It does a good job with compounds but somehow 疾風伝 is an exception.<br />
Again, maybe the version I&#8217;m using is an old one.<br />
But yeah, for the majority of things it does a pretty good job.</p>

                        <p>Hi.　Quick Question. So&#8230;I teach English at a junior high school and usually when I don&#8217;t have class I try to study Japanese.  I would really like to use that time to study using the SRS system that I uploaded to my computer but I can&#8217;t bring my computer to school everyday. Any suggestions on what to study or how to study during &#8220;free time&#8221; while on the job at school? Thanks!</p>

<p>Try Anki &#8211; it works on a mobile phone so you can study using that. I use this to study on my commute to and from work and it works very well for me.<br />
You can download it from <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/" class="autohyperlink">ichi2.net/anki/</a></p>

                        <p>My one concern about this is: Where do speaking and listening come in? I mean, I know you&#8217;re supposed to read sentences aloud, but I find that the idea of &#8220;good Japanese comes from mindlessly mimicking good Japanese&#8221; is very important with pronunciation as well, so without an actual model to listen to and repeat after, it seems that pronunciation would most likely also be a &#8220;little off.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose there&#8217;s only so much someone could do, and I still think your method makes a lot of sense (Actually, my classes in school were very much about mindlessly mimicking conversations and drills to very good effect), but I&#8217;m just curious as to how you addressed this issue. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance 😀</p>

Listening is part of the entire process. Speaking is allowed to come naturally (and avoided otherwise).</p>

                        <p>No but once you build a decent level of grammar by STUDYING sentences (rather than memorizing) you&#8217;ll be able to read books (im talking easy books with fairly few kanji and all have their furigana attached)  Would that not </p>
<p>a) be a much more enjoyable learning experience</p>
<p>b) more beneficial since they are, actually, *real* sentences in every basic sense of the word.</p>
<p>and c) you&#8217;ll able to attach whatever readings for that specific kanji assuming you know all 2k.</p>
<p>The most common form of acceleration in *any* language is reading. You start reading when you&#8217;re at a very young age, you read small children&#8217;s books that provide a very basic vocabulary database which is implanted in your head. Then you slowly adapt new books here and there where you need to look up a word every 15 or so pages (or you understand it by context)</p>

                        <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>after reading your whole blog in the last few days, I finally decided to write a comment.<br />
First of all a big thank you for your motivating blog entries 😀</p>
<p>As for me I have been watching animes/jdramas and listening to Japanese music for over 10 years now. My listening comprehension is REALLY good thanks to this.<br />
I have been studying Japanese at university for 2 years, but only like 4hours per week and then had a huge break again. After that I wanted to continue studying by myself, but somehow I always had too many huge breaks in between.</p>
<p>That is why I&#8217;m still on a beginner&#8217;s level, I&#8217;d say. I could pass level 3 of the JLPT with my current skills, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Since March I&#8217;m living in Japan and my motivation is bigger than ever. Since then I&#8217;ve started again to study Japanese. This time on a daily basis, for as many hours as possible.<br />
Of course I don&#8217;t really have problems with my immersion project here. I also read &#8220;real&#8221; Japanese every day, mostly doujinshi lately. I feel that my Japanese is getting better, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too slow for my taste.<br />
Actually I&#8217;m very frustrated lately. Mainly because I basically could already be fluent by now, but still am on a basic level. It&#8217;s my own fault though.<br />
But as you said in one of your entries, it&#8217;s no use looking back, what is important is what lies ahead.<br />
And I don&#8217;t only want to become fluent, I have DECIDED to become fluent this time.</p>
<p>So here I am, with basic vocab, grammar and kanji knowledge (about 400).<br />
Where should I start?<br />
Should I do RTK1 right now? Can I skip the kanji I already know??<br />
Can I start mining sentences while still studying the kanji or should I only focus on the kanji for the time being?</p>
<p>Somehow I still have this textbook and I know what you think about them, but I REALLY wanna finish it! I think it&#8217;ll take about 4 more weeks to do so, after that I can fully concentrate on other things, but I really wanna finish this damn textbook before that.</p>
<p>So would it be a good idea to start doing RTK1 and entering everything in SRS (I&#8217;m using Anki btw.) while still doing the textbook? Like &#8230; at first I won&#8217;t be able to do many kanji (because of the textbook), but as soon as I&#8217;ve finished I can increase the # of kanji I daily do, right?<br />
Would that be a good idea?</p>
<p>So my plan right now looks more or less like this:<br />
Starting with RTK (btw. do you recommend to learn how to write all the kanji right from the start, too?), while still finishing my current textbook.<br />
Then finish RTK1, after that start with sentence mining.<br />
I intend to use &#8220;Kanji in Context&#8221; (do you know that book? can you recommend it?), A Dictionary of Basic + Intermediate Japanese Grammar for sentence fishing as well as all of my manga, doujinshi, jdrama, anime, variety shows, daily life conversation etc.</p>
<p>Would it hurt to still continue studying Eng-Jap (isolated) vocab via SRS in addition to the sentence input? Yes, I&#8217;m still a little bit doubtful &#8211; that&#8217;s why I feel saver to do a little bit more active studying alongside.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking about getting a Japanese teacher here. It&#8217;s not like a class, more like a volunteer person who will have a conversation with me or whatever.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure if this will help me at all at my current level.</p>
<p>I think my main problem is that I have bought too much material and that I&#8217;m too impatient. I&#8217;m really sacrificing almost every single second I have to study Japanese and in my free time I listen to Japanese music or watch Japanese tv.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s all for now.</p>
<p>Of course I&#8217;m also happy to hear about other peoples&#8217; opinions and am very thankful for hints of any kind.</p>
<p>(Please ignore any mistakes I&#8217;ve made. I&#8217;m not an English native-speaker.)</p>
<p>Bye (^-^)/</p>

                        <p>So how exactly are you supposed to find the meaning of the sentences you find?  For example, I&#8217;m using Doraemon to get my sentences, but on only the 3rd sentence I&#8217;m already stuck.  Doraemon says: いやあ、ろくなことがないね。 I have no idea what ろく means.  I looked it up in <a href="http://jisho.org/" class="autohyperlink">Jisho.org</a>, and it says ろくな means satisfactory&#8230;but that doesn&#8217;t really make sense in the sentence for me.  How will I know that the meanings I&#8217;m giving to sentences are actually correct?</p>

                        <p>I have a few quick questions if you have the time to answer, I&#8217;d love it!</p>
<p>After receiving the link to your site, I&#8217;ve really decided to tweak what I&#8217;ve been doing to follow a good handful of your advice. So now I&#8217;ve got quite a few sources now of sentences and I can already mine sentences from shows and such.</p>
<p>My question is more so, to switch to JP-JP, do I merely do kanji-kana form for q to a? or do I try to explain in JP the gist of the sentence?</p>
<p>My other question is would you consider mining sentences from <a href="http://www.alc.co.jp/index.html" class="autohyperlink">www.alc.co.jp/index.html</a> to be correct? I guess I&#8217;m feeling a little insecure about trusting random dictionary sites/textbooks for correct sentences. XD</p>
<p>Thanks for you time!</p>

                        <p>I have a question about actually learning upwards of 50 sentences per day. For me it takes an extremely long time to find sentences and add them to my SRS. For example a mere10 sentences can take over an hour maybe two. Perhaps I over analyze the sentences and put too much into the answer. Anyway afterwards, at least that day, I am mentally fried or don&#8217;t have the time to learn them all top to bottom. Okay my question: Do any of you just spend a few days adding the sentences and come back another day and spend all your time learning those sentences not focusing on adding more? Whew, that would make a challenging sentence 🙂 BTW my main sources are Mangajin, Teach Yourself Japanese (romaji but sentences seem good), Kodansha Furigana Dictionary, Japanese for Everyone, J-pop/anime lyrics, and Barron&#8217;s Japanese Grammer.</p>
<p>PS On a very side note: If any of you own the US Batman Begins Blu-ray, it contains the Japanese audio!  I hope to see this in more US releases.</p>

                        <p>This is to Katz or anyone reading who can answer this:</p>
<p>How many of you have over 20,000 cards? How would (or do) you deal with using an SRS to learn, say Chinese, Japanese AND Korean if you wanted to do the &#8220;10,000 sentence&#8221; method for each? Wouldn&#8217;t the load eventually just become unbearable and take too long? Is there a limit or shortcoming to spaced repetition in this respect?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d appreciate any answers on this. I&#8217;m considering using Anki for Korean, but I intend to learn Chinese as well. The thought of spending several hours a day in the future doing SRS reps is rather frightening&#8230;</p>

                        <p>@Chris</p>
<p>This is a couple months late, so hopefully you&#8217;ve already had your q answered. I have a min before bed so ill cover this one incase anyone else reading through has a similar query.</p>
<p>two points will pretty much answer your question:<br />
1. your SRS reps will become further and further apart as you get them correct, so you can keep adding cards at a good pace and maintain a similar &#8220;per day&#8221; workload while you keep learning. eventually cards become once a year or two years or more after so many reps.</p>
<p>2. 10k sentences is ALOT of info. Think about it for a min, by the time you have 10k sentances in your deck you can probably pick up any comic-book, magazine, even newspaper or text and have a pretty dambed good idea whats going on. If not perfect comprehension. At this point the SRS becomes obsolete. Rather than spend that 2 hours a day on your SRS, you can spend an hour or two reading a comic book or browsing japanese stuff on amazon or whatever. if you run into something you don&#8217;t know, then you might throw it into your SRS so you can fill gaps in your knowledge further. You&#8217;ll be doing that with a monolingual dictionary &#8211; so there&#8217;s more reading practice. And the process goes on. (I picture this as a smooth gradual process, its not like the plan is: do 10k sentances then -&gt; read comic book)</p>
<p>My strategy is this (and I make no point of saying its the &#8220;right&#8221; way to do it), If im at home with some free time i&#8217;ll put on some music or tv or a movie or something and play around on my SRS. If I finish all my reps and still have free time I&#8217;ll add some items that I want to know. I avoid trying to &#8220;grind out&#8221; 2 hours of straight SRSing. Im doing it all the time when life isnt getting in the way. If I cant cope with the reps ill tweak the level of SRS imput.</p>

                        <p>Just a quick question regarding texts with furigana.<br />
Aside from some manga, what other kinds of texts are available with furigana? There aren&#8217;t any bookstores selling japanese material near where I live, so when looking for books online, how would I know the text contains furigana?</p>
<p>Also, I remember reading one of khatzumoto&#8217;s posts, but I&#8217;m having a hard time finding it now.  Something to do with learning how to read kanji.  I forget, am I supposed (if i were to follow this particular method) to complete RTK before attempting to (learn how to) read japanese characters?  How and when am I supposed to assign a reading to the characters?</p>
<p>Glad if anyone can answer some of my questions, and also, in the question regarding the readings, pointing me to the relevant posts would be helpfull.</p>

                        <p>Ayo, Sam (in answer to part of your comment) and Gabe,</p>
<p>Mrs. Khatzumoto here. Khatz covers how you learn to pronounce the kanji in his <a href="../faqs-frequently-asked-questions/index.html" rel="nofollow">FAQs section</a>. The fourth question down reads:</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Remembering the Kanji Volume 1 (RTK/RTK1) does not cover kanji readings. How will I learn pronunciations of kanji in Japanese?</strong><br />
You learn kanji readings on a sentence-by-sentence basis. When you input a sentence into your SRS, part of the input process will be for you to find out the readings for its kanji. Those readings will be part of the &#8220;answer&#8221; section on an item in your SRS. <a title="RTK First Few Chapters" href="http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/miscPublications/pdf/RK4/RK 1_sample.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Go here to read Heisig himself explain the system</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the comments section of this article 😉 he answers a similar question with a more detailed answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;>how do you manage to memorize the kanji readings and stuff?<br />
1. Learn the reading of each kanji as it used in the sentence. So, rather than learn all the readings of a given kanji, learn the one reading that is being used *in this case*–in the sentence at hand.<br />
2. Add that kanji reading to the “answer” section of the SRS.<br />
Note:<br />
(i) A sentence has a kind of rhythm to it that will actually make the reading quite easy to remember, generally speaking. Certainly, it will be easier to remember than an isolated kanji reading.<br />
(ii) Also, be sure to use SHORT sentences to begin with, don’t overwhelm yourself. Something like 「テレビを見る。」 or 「夕食の支度をする。」 or 「慌てて登校する。」　is a good length.<br />
(iii) Use sentences that have multiple parts of speech. What I mean is, you want nouns, verbs and adverbs/adjectives all in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, to sum up:</p>
<p>1. Don&#8217;t worry about the readings when you are still learning the kanji.<br />
2. After you&#8217;ve learned the kanji, then you learn the kana (hiragana+katakana). These are your pronunciation guide.<br />
3. When you are ready to start picking out sentences from your immersion environment (listening, books, etc.), you will naturally and gradually learn the readings of kanji one by one in the context of individual sentences you enter into your SRS (start really simple!). At this point, dictionaries with sentences, beginner books and books with furigana (tiny hiragana printed over or beside kanji) are your best friend. (Some manga&#8211;especially those written for Japanese children&#8211;put furigana on all the kanji. Like Sam says, it&#8217;s frustrating when you don&#8217;t know if a book from an online store has furigana&#8230;Sorry we don&#8217;t have reviews of furigana books on this site yet&#8211;will put that on the to-do list. Until then, here&#8217;s a link to an article Khatz wrote on how you can automatically put furigana on any Japanese website: <a href:"http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/kanji-reading-aids" rel="nofollow">&#8220;Kanji Reading Aids&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>Here is an example of how to learn pronunciation of kanji in the context of a sentence when you enter it into an SRS:</p>
<p>1) Put the sentence with kanji in the question of your SRS: 行こうよ！<br />
2) Using hiragana, indicate the pronunciation of the kanji in the answer: いこうよ！ (or 行こう＝いこう, etc.）</p>
<p>The fact that each kanji has multiple readings can sound intimidating when you think of it all at once, but it&#8217;s easy when you take it sentence by sentence. Like Khatz says, you just get used to it. Kind of like how English speakers get used to how &#8220;ough&#8221; in words like &#8220;dough&#8221; is pronounced like &#8220;ow&#8221; in &#8220;snow&#8221;, but the &#8220;ough&#8221; in &#8220;cough&#8221; sound like &#8220;off&#8221;, and the &#8220;ough&#8221; in &#8220;rough&#8221; sounds like the &#8220;uff&#8221; in &#8220;cuff&#8221;. When you&#8217;re still learning the alphabet, if you worry about all the diffent ways you can pronounce the vowels, you might get a heart attack. You start out with something easy and fun like &#8220;The Cat in the Hat&#8221; and before you know it you&#8217;re sounding out the highly-processed ingredients on your cereal box and asking your mom what &#8220;dextrose&#8221; and &#8220;trisodium phosphate&#8221; are. Likewise, when learning Japanese pronunciation sentence by sentence, your knowledge gradually builds and connects until you develop a &#8216;sense&#8217; or &#8216;feel&#8217; for how a kanji is probably read (even if you&#8217;re not sure). It&#8217;s a process that you go through a step at a time.</p>

                        <p>So basically to put it into steps, do you:</p>
<p>Read Heisig&#8217;s &#8220;Remember the Kanji&#8221;</p>
<p>Add the individual symbols to your SRS until you remember them all</p>
<p>Read &#8220;Remember the Kana&#8221;</p>
<p>Add the individual symbols to your SRS until you remember them all</p>
<p>And then string sentences together in SRS, that you have obtained from the internet, for example, using the furigana to find out the pronouncination/phoenetics and add that to the answer, along with the meaning of the sentence?</p>
<p>(Sorry im extremely new to this, and the idea of beginning to learn Kanji bewilders me at the moment)</p>

<p>Yes, it&#8217;s generally considered by most people that it was a bad idea. You don&#8217;t want to complicate the process by adding a whole new element to it. If you learn all the on-yomi, soon you&#8217;ll be relying on reading the sounds only, and not being able to simply recognise words. In short, you could spend months learning RTK2, which is far harder than RTK1, and in the long run, it may not help you at all.</p>

                        <p>I&#8217;m not sure If I understand the bit about using Japanese to define a Japanese sentence, if the point is to translate it so it is easily understood by yourself(a learner) so it can be used in an SRS, how is this done in the language you are trying to understand?</p>

I&#8217;ve used Heisig to learn all my Hiragana and Katakana and am about 200 kanji deep in my quest to finish &#8220;Remembering the Kanji 1&#8221;.  When exactly do you suggest starting to sentence mine and SRS with sentences?  After all 2000+ kanji are memorized or somewhere along the way?</p>

                        <p>hey volks,</p>
<p>now I&#8217;ve decided to enter my post here. Of course this site is really briliant. However, I think I got stucked in my learning prozess. I have about 500 entries in my SRS just to realize that I only can answer just a few ones of them and to forget almost all the pronouncation and things&#8230; This is really frustrating-,.-<br />
I bought RTK2 and its&#8230; like&#8230; its okay, but not the really good thing you know?<br />
Somehow I&#8217;ve got the feeling to forget all the kanji meanings and only can say a hand of these sentences. I have been in Japan for two weeks and all the others taking classes were able to speak japanese much better than me.<br />
I miss a bit my payoff &#8230; Or am I too impatient?<br />
During this times i miss someone to chat with, who has gone through the same problems. This would be so nice maybe&#8230;. However<br />
Thank your for answers</p>
<p>Alex</p>

                        <p>To anyone who might be able to help:</p>
<p>When I add my sentences into my SRS, what do I do with the words that are new to me?  Do I make separate flash cards with just a single word, or do I try to learn entire phrases?  I feel like I have to keep failing a card over and over because I can&#8217;t remember the pronunciation of just one word&#8230;.What should I do?  </p>
<p>One last thing: Khatz (or anybody): when you say &#8220;Don&#8217;t memorize the sentences&#8221; what precisely do you mean?  Are you saying just don&#8217;t use rote memory?  Should I just read it (at first with the help of furigana), then if I can&#8217;t pass the four checks, fail the card, and repeat until I get it?  Thanks everybody!</p>

                        <p>Kevin,</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably figured out an answer to your question, but here&#8217;s what I do with new words: add more sentences with that word. A good place to go is <a href="http://www.jisho.org/" class="autohyperlink">www.jisho.org/</a> and put in your word, and then search for sentences with that word in it (I wouldn&#8217;t rely on the site too much because some of the sentences/translations are off). </p>
<p>As for not memorizing, just don&#8217;t try to memorize the sentence so that you can recall it without the SRS. Of course, you&#8217;ll be memorizing the kanji, the readings, &#8220;the sentence&#8221; if you will, but only with the SRS. You don&#8217;t need to pull sentences out of your head while walking around town, just to make sure you&#8217;ve memorized them. Like Khatz said, it&#8217;s too failure prone and you might get the sentence wrong.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

                        <p>Lost in Japanese,</p>
<p>Remember that the point of putting sentences in your SRS is to be able to do the four things that Khatz said in the post: 1) be able to say it aloud 2) know the meaning of all the words in that sentence 3) know the overall meaning of the sentence and 4) be able to write it down yourself.</p>
<p>The answer or &#8220;back&#8221; part will have the aids that you will need to &#8220;decode&#8221; your sentence. It would of course be better if it&#8217;s in kana or kanji. It really will depend on you what you will put on the answer part, whichever will really help you understand what the sentence is trying to say.</p>
<p>I have my own question for Khatz and the other readers:</p>
<p>What is your opinion on the &#8220;proper way of writing kanji&#8221;? I.e. stroke order and stuff. A lot of books and guides insist that all kanji should be written in a specific order. I&#8217;ve searched and this site does not address this.</p>
<p>Thank you and keep up the good work!</p>

                        <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>I think I finally get the point of the sentences.  Before I was spending too much time focusing on the English definition which can be frustrating.  Anyways, reading your four criteria of learning a sentence, I know I must start reading aloud more.  However I do most of my SRSing on the train, so as not to appear as a weirdo, which is hard enough in itself, would it be ok to whisper the reading aloud?  Is the point here just to physically have sounds coming out of your mouth regardless of how loud they might be?</p>
<p>Thx 4 the time</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if this helps or not, but somebody posted a link to a sentence list in excel format containing ~1,100 facts which can be imported relatively easily into an SRS.  Check it out if interested&#8230;</p>

                        <p>Howdy,</p>
<p>This is to anyone who&#8217;s doing/has done 5,000+ sentences. I looked around the site/internets, but couldn&#8217;t find a concrete answer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 6 or 7 weeks into the 10,000 sentence &#8216;method&#8217; for Korean, and using Mnemosyne. Right now, I&#8217;ve got 1,526 items in the program (70 Not Memorised). Today, there are about 140 sentences scheduled. That&#8217;s a lot of freakin&#8217; sentences.</p>
<p>What happens when I get to 5,000 items? Should I expect to review 400 or more a day?</p>
<p>A quick reply would be awesome!</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
Gabriel</p>

<p>I&#8217;m living in Seoul, also studying Korean, but I&#8217;ve just started the journey.  So I was wondering if there was a plan for a little further down the road!</p>

                        <p>Yep. Got my answer a couple of months ago when I hit 5,000 cards. It turns out, I&#8217;m hovering between 140 and 170 scheduled reps a day now. Not too far off from where I was.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re just starting out, I would soak up as much advice from this site as possible, as soon as possible. I went through two years of hagwon classes before finding AJATT. Two years of low-retention rates and constantly wondering, &#8220;When am I going to understand &#8216;real&#8217; Korean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let me get you started. This is mostly taken from AJATT.</p>
<p>TV = On. (Korean shows of course). Dramas, talk shows, cartoons, music videos. Whatever. Personally, I don&#8217;t care what I watch, as long as it&#8217;s in Korean. I have no Korean critic. Brainy? Fine. Teeny-bopper? Fine. News? Religious? Informercials? Fine. Oh, those little colored subtitles that get blasted across the screen on the &#8216;celebrities-doing-random-stuff&#8217; shows are your friend. Sometimes they explain the situation. Sometimes they give a word-for-word of what someone just said. I figure, if those words are common enough to be on a mainstream celebrity show, they&#8217;re probably worth knowing. So in the SRS they go. Watching Korean TV seems so obvious. I wish I had started
