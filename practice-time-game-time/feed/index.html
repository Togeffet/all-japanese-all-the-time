					<description><![CDATA[What really helped me gain confidence was filming myself speaking Japanese and posting them on youtube.(click my name, I actually would like to hear feedback about my Japanese proficiency so feel free to leave a comment) 
 
Just keep doing it even if it feels forced or unnatural. It helps your brain to start actually thinking in Japanese the more you use it. I just say whatever is on my mind at the time of filming, I don&#039;t write down what I want to say. I think this is the best approach because it helps your become more natural rather than a performance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good rant. I agree entirely... though I&#039;ve been allowing myself to get extremely sidetracked lately due to school and work demanding more and more from me. :/

I think it would really help to have some contacts on Skype or something who I could talk to in Japanese. I wouldn&#039;t be able to communicate very well at first, but I&#039;m sure I could learn quickly. I really need to, at any rate.]]></description>
