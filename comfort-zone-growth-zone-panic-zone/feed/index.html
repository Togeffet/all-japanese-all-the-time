					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Inputs and outputs. Environments and behaviors. This also means that everything you do counts. Everything you do matters. If you do nothing (zero inputs), you get nothing. If you do something, you get something. If you do something big, deep and/or long enough, you get some big, deep and long outputs. It&#8217;s not quite that linear, at least in terms of perception (hence intermediate angst), but it really is that simple. Too simple, in my humble opinion, to require a blog to explain it.
