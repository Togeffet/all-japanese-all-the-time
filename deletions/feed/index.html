					<description><![CDATA[I had the same problem in school. I did both French and German (for five and four years), and hated every minute. Classes were boring, the teacher unpleasant, and I ended up determined that languages &quot;weren&#039;t my thing&quot; and resolved to never study them again. A few years later I got a German girlfriend, and decided to learn german for her. Things went so much better the second time... I learnt what I wanted to learn, I had fun, I did it all &lt;em&gt;on my own terms&lt;/em&gt;. And I&#039;ve been rather successful without lessons.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome!Â  You know what, I had kinda dismissed SRS for me personally for language learning for that exact reason: I&#039;d used it for a few months and had 400-some-odd cards and it just got to be too much of a hassle.Â  You&#039;ve made me think I should maybe give it another shot, this time deleting cards after they&#039;ve been done to death (I never deleted a card before, ever).
Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another way I&#039;ve seen to do this, is set the leech threshold for your SRS very low, and it&#039;ll take care of problem cards itself-- and you know which ones you really like, because you want it back when it suspends the card.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very true about the ew feeling, I usually don&#039;t go a day without at least some deletions. The SRS needs to stay fun, or else you will avoid it until it&#039;s days, weeks, months before you dare to touch it again. You will dread it.
Also, when something is fun, you are so much more motivated to do it, and when something is not, well, you won&#039;t! I have an example.
I started AJATTing last year in 8th grade around the start of the year. Next year(right now), according to district reqs. I have to take atleast 3 years of foreign language. First off, none of the choices appealed to me. German, French, Spanish, Chinese (Sorry If you get offended :P ) 
I chose german because my dad wanted me to, and I really didn&#039;t care which one I did. 
&lt;strong&gt;Basically&lt;/strong&gt;
It&#039;s terrible. My class is full of airheads, and it&#039;s not fun at all. Today we took a listening test which counts towards our semester exam grade, and we&#039;d have to speak back into a voice recorder. Everybody, including me, understood about 20%, and with that comprehension, how are you supposed to know what to say back?
They speak too fast for people in a beginner German 1 class, and guaranteed, no lies, we didn&#039;t know 75% of the words, because we never learned them.
&lt;strong&gt;How fun.&lt;/strong&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome post! Yeah, I am deleting more often, and I think deleting has really allowed me to keep the flow of my SRS journey, instead of me periodically sighing at a sentence I hate, which really disrupts my motivation in the SRS process. Thanks!]]></description>
