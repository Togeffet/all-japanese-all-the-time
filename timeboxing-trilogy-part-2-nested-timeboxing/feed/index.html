					<description><![CDATA[When you were coming out with these articles I never really cared since I&#039;ve never used timeboxing, but in the situation I&#039;m currently in, I&#039;m finding I really need to try it in my life. So far so good, bit hard to grasp at first, but I&#039;m looking forward to reading the future articles (which I&#039;m about to) to in essence make Japanese, and my life easier. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using 2 minute SRS reps for ages now, but I got bored of them at one point, completely forgot about it, and just ignored it whenever the time limit finished. I think the main problem I have with timeboxing is that when I&#039;m doing SRS reps, I&#039;ll find a word in a definition, or in the Japanese recording I&#039;ve got going on in the background, and then I&#039;ll look up the word, add it, find another word in the definition, find a new kanji etc, etc, and end up very off track.

This article has inspired me to try timeboxing again, for Japanese and schoolwork. I certainly know how hard it is to stay focused on a planned hour of homework.]]></description>
