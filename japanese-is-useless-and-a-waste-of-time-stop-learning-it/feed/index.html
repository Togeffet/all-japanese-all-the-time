					<description><![CDATA[It really is that simple. Japanese isn&#039;t important. I don&#039;t have to learn it. I don&#039;t have to deal with it. I don&#039;t have to spend my days suffering in agony for a reward that is not worth it. So, why am I still here? That&#039;s a good question. So is &quot;Why is the sky blue? Why is the grass green?&quot; The answer is the same for those questions as it is for this question; because it is. Or, in this case, because I am. I think, therefore I am. I learn Japanese, therefore I am. Japanese is a part of me now. Whether I want it to be or not, It&#039;s a fact. Trashing Japanese is equal to trashing a part of myself. And I&#039;ve come way too far to do that now. It doesn&#039;t matter if I started learning Japanese simply because I can, or for a more justified and &quot;meaningful&quot; reason, the point is, I&#039;ve started learning Japanese. &quot;It doesn&#039;t matter how I get there, results are all that matter.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You sound like me! For me, positive reinforcement is way more helpful than this negative vibe. However, something I&#039;ve sort of noticed about AJATT is that a lot of things are repeated, just from different angles and perspectives. For a long while, I didn&#039;t &quot;get&quot; AJATT, but then, a post came along and things just clicked. I knew what I needed to do.
 
This type of negative motivational material doesn&#039;t really work for me either, but it works for some. Just look at the wide range of interesting comments here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Um, what&#039;s the purpose of this post? It&#039;s reeking with negativity. While I respect the opinion, to each his own right? It&#039;s not like a part of you will be taken away just by studying something. I say learn by thinking of it as a hobby (like a video game perhaps?) and it&#039;ll turn into a passion. Don&#039;t think of it as something that you should do, just enjoy the moment of the learning process. That&#039;s it. 

P.S: If you&#039;re really passionate about something, you&#039;ll pursue it no matter how hard someone tries to convince you otherwise. Don&#039;t think about the time that may pass, or how it&#039;s too late for you to learn something because you&#039;re old--time DOES pass, there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. By the time you realized that time has indeed passed you by, voila, you&#039;ve already learned the language. ]]></description>
