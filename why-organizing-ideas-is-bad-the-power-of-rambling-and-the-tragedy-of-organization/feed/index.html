					<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s in Japanese - the guitar solo is still the best part... :p

This idea works better for the sound on video clips etc. If I hear something I like or find amusing while browsing YouTube etc, I just grab it and stick it on my mp3 player.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[At risk of sounding obnoxious, WHY WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?!

It sounds like some horrible Reebok sweatshop way to create immersion, where your child neurons are forced into arduous labour without ever having the chance to just enjoy their life ... or something. At some point, I think they&#039;ll try to start a communist revolution in your head.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a disorganized idea that I use:

Delete the intro and outro to songs. Stay immersed in lyrics, not melody. 

Your immersion in music is now 10-20% more efficient. The seconds will add up to hours and eventually days.

Or, you know, don&#039;t. I&#039;m rambling here...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey &#039;moto... just a few thoughts.

Your writing is like Shakespeare&#039;s... so many genius bonuses for the careful readers, and yet irriguous with a current of profane jokes and references. You should &quot;back up&quot; your writing in physical book form and propagate it so that it transcends the atlantis that the internet and its accessories may one day become. &quot;The Thao of Back Up&quot; extending beyond digital copies...that kinda thing.

I&#039;m thinking about this because...while the internet and technology has for the time evar allowed us to record and store disorganized ideas and rants extensively...paranoid people will point out that the internetc may not last forever, and it&#039;s blogs like yours that rouse me from my torpor and fear such an outcome. Does this mean I&#039;m backing up AJATT on my hard drive? No...I&#039;m may be an embarrassingly annoying fan, but I haven&#039;t completely lost my mind.

It does, however, mean that I have continued as is my personal custom with converting my favorite bits of this post into SRS flashcard knowledge bites that I will hopefully review and retain until the worms come. Laters]]></description>
