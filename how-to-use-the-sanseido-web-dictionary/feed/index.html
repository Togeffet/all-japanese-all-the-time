					<description><![CDATA[Sanseido is good if you want to stop searching just for word translation and want to try understand the meaning by reading the explanation in japanese as well like native speakres do. If you are looking for examples on how to use this or that word in a sentence, I really love the website Tangorin.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, Sanseido isn&#039;t rich in examples, just in nice, short definitions. Try Yahoo for more examples.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll try more tomorrow - I ran out of time today, but so far it was: 成功；失敗；態度：and I think I tried 後悔.  But basically I just get like &quot;the antonym of 成功　＝　失敗；another usage of 成功 is ....this is the English...but no examples.  (At least I&#039;m reading it and I don&#039;t see anything that comes off as an example to me.)  After those four I ran out of time/wrote the comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I went and looked it up in 4 dictionaries and didn&#039;t find it. I think the combination of it being a new/computer word, and being such a simple logical compound, makes it so that no one has bothered to define it yet. Anyway, you were right abouts its meaning. The reading is みどく, by the way,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, in an effort to move closer to immersion, today I switched over my gmail and google homepage to Japanese. it was pretty overwhelming, so I figured I might as well go ahead and start sentence mining... so, the first sentence i came across was &#039;スレッドを未読にしました&#039; .. pretty sweet, right? so i know it means basically something about marking the email unread (because thats what i had just managed to do).. so, i figured i would look up 未読 with Sanseido to go ahead and try to start being monolingual in my srs usage too. but it didnt have it! did i do something wrong? or did i just get really unlucky.. basically i just went and pasted in 未読 into the search box.. am i searching wrong?

but other than that, i think my first foray into a more japanese-y live is going well. or it will be, once i get the hang of  sanseido.. :) thanks for the walkthrough..]]></description>
