					<description><![CDATA[Nice story !

I think that language classrooms suck, but it is due to the way they teachers teach, I mean, it could be better, I think it is possible to adapt the ajatt/antimoon method. 

We start learning foreign languages at the age of 12, and I don&#039;t think that at this age all kids are mature enough to go through the ajatt method by themselves. A teacher could be useful to teach them the ajatt method and give them some motivation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, my perspective has changed a little bit since I wrote this email. I still thank Khatzumoto for everything, his methods are a good guide to get yourself going. However, the more you learn, the less you really need to look at this blog, and the less you need an SRS. The more you&#039;re immersed into a Japanese environment, the more it just becomes part of your life. I don&#039;t look back at this blog anymore, nor do I use an SRS anymore. I&#039;ve found my own way into learning languages, and I think everyone should try to find their own way too... using sites like these to help grow that method. Everyone has their own path that&#039;s right for them.

Also, classes aren&#039;t bad. After Japanese camp, I realized that. As long as they are taught fully in Japanese, with no English ever being said unless someone is in danger, or is misbehaving terribly. That&#039;s my theory. I teach English as a Second Language now, and I really love it (^-^). Japanese camp really gave me that push into good Japanese conversations. I learned so much there. However, it was this site that taught me how to study on my own, and this site that gave me the confidence that it can be done. I encourage everyone to not follow this site 100% down to every word. Learning a language is something personal, and no method is perfect for everyone. Everyone needs to find their own way. I used to think this site was amazing, and held the perfect method, but I realized even I have gone off into my own method that works for me.

Also, methods aren&#039;t set in stone! They are like seeds. The more you nuture them with personal experience, and outside influence, the larger they grow as unique trees.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Language classrooms can stink, and so can teachers and their dogmatic approach. And this is one such case. 

The teacher dissed a rather uh, radical approach (sorry, Khatzumoto). Classrooms can be effective etc. So what? What&#039;s upsetting here is that he almost crushed this girl&#039;s confidence and will to learn a foreign language because it did not fit into his controlled learning environment agenda. He also provided some bad advice. &quot;Random&quot; things will fall into place, some language study and exposure is better than doing nothing and waiting for college.

TPRS, Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling, formerly known as Total Physical Response Storytelling is copyrighted (and also a mouthful). I fail to see the point. The real power of any classroom setting is not the method, it&#039;s the teacher. And this one stinks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@jadpan
Have you ever seen the Assimil language books.  I&#039;m using the French and Japanese one and they are pretty books made up of of really short stories you try to understand and learn.  Granted they are language materials so you may end up saying things like &quot;Hello good sir, a pleasure to make your acquaintance&quot;, but they are a good start.  I plan on moving to real books and stories when I finish working through them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jadpan: I hope to become an English teacher in Japan one day, and I&#039;m looking for methods that can be used in the classroom that are similar to AJATT. I will research TPRS, it sounds interesting. When I become a teacher, I want to encourage my future students to use methods similar to AJATT if they are seriously committed to learning English, or any other language. I don&#039;t know how cirriculums work in Japan, but if I some how can, I&#039;d like to give my students the most I can in the classroom, and advice for out of the classroom when it comes to learning a language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Seeing quite a few comments about language classrooms, I&#039;ve got to say, not all language classrooms are created equally. This is coming from 2 perspectives, one as a student and one as a language teacher. 

I also took four years of French in high school. I was pretty good by the end. I tested out of the first two years of college French and completely outperformed my 3rd year university classmates as a freshman. By the end of my junior year (and a year in France) I was asked by a French person if I was French. Not so much an ego trip as demonstrating that &quot;traditional&quot; methods can and do work. Sure, it took 7 years, but it worked. Obviously I wasn&#039;t living a 24/7 French life, so it took a bit longer than Khatzumoto&#039;s method.

Now for my perspective as a language teacher (I taught French for 3 years in America, now I&#039;m teaching English in Japan), I just have to say that Khatzumoto doesn&#039;t have a copyright on the research upon which his method is based (not that he&#039;s ever claimed such a thing). My preferred methodology is TPRS, Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling. It&#039;s based largely upon Krashen&#039;s hypotheses, as is Khatzumoto&#039;s method, while being informed by general trends in second language acquisition research as well as actual classroom, anecdotal evidence and action research. I would wager that it actually outperforms AJATT in that all input is comprehensible whereas with AJATT, input isn&#039;t designed to be comprehensible for the learner. The learner must seek out comprehensible input or make input comprehensible on their own. TPRS underperforms in that classroom hours are severely limited compared to out of classroom hours. This obviously is a big deal, but doesn&#039;t negate the power of a classroom based on comprehensible input. No doubt a TPRS class, plus AJATT would have incredible results.

For a TPRS experience, you can google it and read about it (don&#039;t confuse with TPR) or check out fluencyfast.com. No, I don&#039;t work for them, I just believe in the method strongly. And I don&#039;t like blanket remarks about &quot;formal&quot; language classrooms. (Unfortunately, they don&#039;t have Japanese classes regularly if at all.)

I&#039;d also like to add that more than a methodology, it&#039;s a student&#039;s commitment and drive to learn a language that is of utmost importance. If a student is ambivalent or, worse, actively despises learning a foreign language, no method in the world will bring them to fluency. By the way, there are MANY people who say they want to learn a foreign language, but who don&#039;t really mean it or who are actually ambivalent. I&#039;d bet that for every 1 student who successfully reaches fluency following Khatzumoto&#039;s steps, there are a 100 or more who have started and not made it. It&#039;s because it takes commitment to acquire/learn a language. People don&#039;t realize there is no finish line; you never stop learning a language, even your first language. It&#039;s incredibly hard to take on a task which doesn&#039;t have a set ending. 

Anyway, I could go on, but I think I got my point across. Not all language classes are the same, and if you want to know another language, it&#039;s going to take time and effort and you&#039;ll never be done.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[皆さんのコメントがわたしを励ましてくれます。ありがとうございます！(^-^)

Cush: For me, what has really helped me tremendously is every day keeping to a Japanese environment, studying everything that I hear, and read. The SRS is only a tool I use to help keep the things that I am learning in my memory. It&#039;s not something of which I base my learning. I don&#039;t really keep track of how many sentences I have in my SRS, I&#039;m adding more each day. To me, keeping track of how many sentences I have in it is not that important, I&#039;m not limited to the sentences I have mined for my SRS. The base of my learning is the Japanese environment I&#039;ve created for myself, that&#039;s the most important part of my progress. The stronger it is, the more input I&#039;m getting. An SRS will help you take in, and really know the input you&#039;ve been getting, but it&#039;ll never create new input for you.]]></description>

If you are using your sentence SRS as a gauge for completion that is a very dangerous thing to do.  You have to do the kanji and listening, too.  Don&#039;t think of it as a percent till completion, it will click when your mind is ready.  Just keep at it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Socrates is gonna be pissed when he reads this post. If you ask a language pedagogue whether or not formal instruction is necessary to learn Japanese, he&#039;s going to be thinking about his job security. If you ask a barber whether you need a haircut, he&#039;ll tell you &quot;not only do you need a haircut, you need a STYLE!&quot; which more or less happened here. His statement about the inferiority of learning &quot;random things&quot; is ludicrous. The best speakers of Japanese on the planet are native speakers, and they didn&#039;t learn with textbooks. I guess that if formal instruction is all you&#039;ve known for decades it&#039;s hard to rationally entertain alternatives, which is why Heisig is so vehemently opposed by the mainstream.

Also, how can you stand simpleton characters? They&#039;re hideous. Even the Japanese simplified characters are often questionable (広????).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The title to this post sums up what both amazes and depresses me the most. I, too, took four years of French in school (high school). I placed into a low level in college, still unable to read much or hold a real conversation, and only over the summer after that quarter of French, which I spent listening to French news radio and reading articles and later books in French, did I get to anything remotely close to the level I&#039;ve now gotten to in Japanese, after less than a year of study. My French (after a year spent in a francophone household) is still, on the whole, stronger than my Japanese, but it shocks me sometimes how much more natural Japanese already feels to me.

I will have to stop taking Japanese classes in the fall (yes I have been taking classes at the same time, but my success is largely as a result of all the listening, I feel) and what people don&#039;t get is that my regret is not about not being able to study the language - I can do that just fine, perhaps better without the class. What I will miss is the people (lots of fun, even if their pronunciation can be excruciating) and the easy A.

I&#039;m actually beginning to wonder if all those years struggling with French in a classroom setting mostly just trained me to struggle and to not have confidence in my French.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I spent 6 years trying to learn foreign languages before college.  If I had AJATT then, I&#039;m almost 100% confident I&#039;d be fluent in another foreign language and now working on my 3rd (Japanese). 

Classroom language is useless, I&#039;ve been living in Japan for almost a year now and the methods on this website will shoot your Japanese into super-ultra space while your peers will be struggling out of Earth&#039;s atmosphere.  At first it might feel slow [with RtK], but you will hit a point where everything makes sense.

Just remember to never skip a day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[too emo.

No, seriously, good job!
I am also getting good results with the AJATT method.
I started studying japanese because I wanted to see if it&#039;s possible to learn a language without doing any output at all. I don&#039;t care about being able to speak at all (for the moment, at least) but reading literature is important to me. I&#039;d say so far it&#039;s working well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unique story :) Outright evidence that Khatzumoto&#039;s method is far superior to classes~ And with the time frames for each language set right next to each other, boy does it make those university classes look bad! （*笑*）

Anyway, your story really says a lot.  One of those things that make me wanna run off and go do &#038; add sentences like there&#039;s no tomorrow x3]]></description>
