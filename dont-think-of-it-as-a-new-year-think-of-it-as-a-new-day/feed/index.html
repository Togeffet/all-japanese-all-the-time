					<description><![CDATA[Hahaha, I know how you feel.  I don&#039;t really have a New Years Resolution, but my brother wants to make me to go to a gym.

He&#039;s the same NEET who wants to make sure I never learn another language, ever.  Think of a annoying video game character who thinks English is the best thing since sliced bread.  And just so people knows, he is another person who thinks Japanese is the hardest language ever.

					<description><![CDATA[It really doesn&#039;t take 10000 hours to learn a language. Neither does it take a second. It takes 20 hours.
Watch a talk by a TED fella Josh Kaufman:

					<description><![CDATA[Right on. Every year on new years eve my mom talks to me about her new years resolutions and how she&#039;s going to start exercising more and all that crap. If you&#039;re going to do something, why wait until after new years? Why don&#039;t you stop talking to me about how you&#039;re going to do it and start doing it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I quite agree with you. I&#039;ve never understood why people are so focused on these occassions like Christmas and New Year. And I&#039;ve really begun loathing this concerning about presents, writing Christmas cards each other... I suggest we all should live every day as if it&#039;s a special ceremony, celebration, holiday and so on.  
At the moment I&#039;m acquiring English and I think I don&#039;t do it that bad. Now I want to watch another season of Little Britain to sharp my listening comprehension and my British accent :)]]></description>
