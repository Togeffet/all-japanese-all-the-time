					<description><![CDATA[I had a conversation with my girlfriend (Japanese school teacher) recently about this, because I&#039;m at the phase where I&#039;m trying to figure out when to use kanji or not for some words and she said if someone uses to much kanji in the wrong situation (informal stuff) that they come across as thinking they are superior or something. 

Also, to little kanji is hard to read even for Japanese people. 
So, I guess you have to strike a balance, and reading a lot will give you an idea of what&#039;s the norm for each word.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I notice how you frequently use kanji for words that are usually written in kana like 此処　Instead of  ここ、　何故’　Over　なぜ　etc. Personally I think its a lot cooler to use kanjified versions, but how do Japanese people view this? Would it come across as pretentious, cool, or どうでもいい？]]></description>
