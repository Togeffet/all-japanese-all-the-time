					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, it&#039;s great to have audio with transcripts.

on another note,I recently found something called key hole TV.  (http://www.v2p.jp/video/english/)   It seems to have been started by the government.  It has japanese tv channels and radio in live streams.  Perhaps you can add it to your site.  Sorry it&#039;s a bit out of place but I don&#039;t know where to post it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is great for night-time listening since it hasn&#039;t got any beats in it (Like music).
First time I tried to listen to something in Japanese, as I slept, I dreamt a weird dream in Japanese, even though it was limited to an eating situation since I&#039;m still only doing kanji (555). Was fun as heck though, dreamt I had a Japanese family and that my normal family had come to visit, and that their manners sucked and I had to be a diplomat and explain everything to them. Lol....

Anyways, thanks for posting, you cheeky rascals ^_^]]></description>

I am hoping you can comment on some of these audio books and which use modern language, as opposed to old language used to reflect the time/context of the story.

Thanks!]]></description>

わぁ〜、どうもありがとうございます！

そして、おめでとうございます、toadhoさん。よくがんばったんですね。

アメリカ人だけど、フランス語で外国語を勉強する事のブログを書くつもりです。いつからまだわかりませんけど、きっとできると思います。

In English: Alice in Wonderland? In Japanese!
Wow, thank you so much!

Congratulations, toadho! You kick ass. =P (=P for the silly English translation)

I&#039;m an American, but I plan to start a language-learning blog in French. I don&#039;t yet know when I&#039;ll start, but I&#039;m sure I can do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This probably isn&#039;t the proper place for this, but I can&#039;t contain myself...

やった！I just  finished Heisig Vol. 1!　Took me a little under two months (my goal was actually to finish by the end of this month, but I started speeding up when I could tell the end was near...) I definitely don&#039;t have them all &quot;in my head&quot; yet, and I probably (mmm...make that definitely) need to touch up a few of my stories, but Anki should take care of most of that within the next few months as long as I continue to do my reps.

Anyway, I have a few questions/comments, I might shoot you an e-mail sometime in the near future. And thank you for the inspiration!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;俺だ。I hate that story…&quot;

If it makes you feel better, they really help beginners. Your Japanese is really awesome (obviously). You are a huge inspiration.

Any who, on a less melodramatic note, I posted the link to your blog on another site (one of the learn Japanese in 5 minutes sites) and they said that you were just &quot;posting amazon links to pimp readers money&quot;. Yes, they actually said &quot;pimp&quot;. Even if you were a complete fake, I wouldn&#039;t care, because your advice is so useful.

I realize why you recommended staying away from internet forums now....
Anyways, keep up the good work.]]></description>

I use K-lite Codec Pack (google it) with Media Player Classic and that plays pretty much everything. There&#039;s also CCCP or something and VLC Player but VLC is too bulky imo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found that my local library (Vancouver, Canada) has chinese audio books in both mandarin and cantonese.  I haven&#039;t yet had time to go down there and check them out (due to work taking up all my time), but they&#039;re in the online catalogue.  I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll be transcripts of a book, probably abridged for the audio version.

there are some audio podcasts with transcripts over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lingq.com/learn/zh/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lingq&lt;/a&gt; .  check out the chinese section.  i just listened to a podcast about the sichuan earthquake, and there&#039;s an exact transcript for it on the site.]]></description>
