					<description><![CDATA[I have always wondered why anyone would want to speak with a specific accent, can somebody explain that to me?
If you don&#039;t, and have never, lived in Paris why try to sound like you do? Same with any other accent and by extension, dialect.
I can understand wanting to sound natural, I also suppress my German accent as much as I can and lean towards a &quot;British&quot; pronounciation rather than &quot;American&quot; (whatever that may mean), but I have no interest in speaking a regional accent. 
If anyone could elaborate on this mindset I&#039;d be much obliged.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is old (sort of), but I want to comment anyway... can anyone recommend a female actor &#039;surrogate&#039; who doesn&#039;t use overly feminine speech (in their works)? 

I prefer masculine speech but I would only be able to use it in say vlogs or with really close Japanese friends or those learning Japanese (since I&#039;m a girl)... I think most girls speak in a quite neutral way anyway - I just want to find a female actor I really like. 

Any recommendations?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s all about dat 標準語 though.

Just kidding. When I first watched 海が聞こえる by Studio Ghibli, I was so intrigued by this dialect that was so different than anything I heard, and at the time it was pretty unintelligible for me.

I watched it so many times (probably around 100+ times), along with some other stuff, and now I can speak 土佐弁, haha.

I sort of realized most Japanese learners settle for Kansai dialect, which sort of makes most of the other dialects sort of like a black sheep. Kansai is cool and all, but there are just some dialects that are way cooler (in my opinion of course), like Tosa.

It&#039;s all about the input, input, and more input. Output just follows, and sometimes the dialect just comes out without thinking, lol.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I completely agree on the influences of one&#039;s native language. Native English speakers aren&#039;t usually aware that English has a specific stress-timed rhythm that isn&#039;t found in a lot of other languages. Stress or lack-there-of doesn&#039;t seem to get mentioned very often in foreign language classes, so a lot of learners don&#039;t even realize the problem exists.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of shadowing one person in particular. This is true when doing an accent in your own language, as well. I think a big mistake a lot of American actors who try to do British roles have is that they try to do a generic accent as opposed to singling out one accent from within the UK and sticking to that. It&#039;s a lot less likely to sound fake if you&#039;re copying one person instead of a patchwork of different people who don&#039;t speak the same way.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To Skyler: to be frank, I&#039;ve never met an English / American able to speak french without an english accent. I don&#039;t know why, but it probably has to do with the heavy inflexions of English language. So if you are an English speaker, I would suggest focusing first on getting rid of it instead of targetting a so-called &quot;parisian accent&quot; (which as already mentioned is either elusive -if you think &quot;accent of the parisian on the street&quot;- or completely dated -if you think of a typical accent such as in old movies like Hôtel du Nord). This advice would apply as well to other student of French or in general to any foreign language speaker of any origin, but there are languages which, in terms of pronounciation, are specially badly matched and French and English is one such pair (French also have this dreadful accent -that for some reason native English speakers find &quot;cute&quot; but that ashames us to no end). 
Actually, I&#039;m realizing that there&#039;s a neglected gold mine in language education here: creating education material targeted not only on language learned but also on the native language of learners to get rid of the native language&#039;s bad influences (accent, but also grammar mistakes, litteral translation of language-specific expressions and idioms often translated literally)...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[   Skyler spaking xD... I like that name Khatz nice choice, and I&#039;m flattered you posted my question on your blog!  
 
I guess my idea of a native accent is different than other people&#039;s.  I definitely understand that there will be more than one accent in Paris, but notice I only said A Parisian accent not THE Parisian accent.  I don&#039;t really know how I will choose, but I will be traveling to Paris the upcoming Summer.  I guess will just try to learn the Parisian accent that I like the most (which will most likely be this &quot;neutral&quot; accent especially since it is the accent I probably have been listening to the most).  I think I have heard of another French person talk about this single native Parisian accent.  He/She said it was the accent of the working class in Paris and the people of St. Dennis.
Now just to share some of my opinions.  I don&#039;t believe there is such thing as a neutral accent nor a generic TV accent.  Either you have an accent or you don&#039;t (and if you don&#039;t then you don&#039;t speak).  If this &quot;neutral&quot; accent is spoken by people born and raised in Paris in their everyday lives then I consider it a native Parisian accent.  And this &quot;generic TV&quot; accent spoken by NY newscasters is probably the General American accent which isn&#039;t a &quot;generic TV&quot; accent; it is a living and native accent of the US.  We use it here in Omaha.
