					<description><![CDATA[think it in this way:
you choose a method so you are starting to learn &quot;one, two, treee, how are you?&quot;. S#####y it doesn&#039;t work. Change method.
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO SAY ONE TWO THREEEE HOW ARE YOU
so with the other method you start to learn &quot;the subjects were provided with a questionnaire&quot; (read a random book). Shitty is too hard. Change method.
....repeat step 1
....repeat step 2
....for a lot of time

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, I can relate to your dilemma. The web seems to provide &quot;too many&quot; choices. One thing I can suggest is to follow up and see what other people say about an approach or method. My personal preference i have talked about on http://www.strategiesinlanguagelearning.com/best_language_classes/
and I explain why I think it needs further investigation by anyone who wants to find a really effective approach.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oops, only now I realized I should have posted as a reply. Sorry. Anyway...below is the answer.
Well, you can‚Äôt change the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù method. But the tests are always about output. So, it‚Äôs actually about finding an ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù method which really helps you and then making its OUTPUT fit into the official system.
Kinda like learning Japanese through AJATT and then taking JLPT tests. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The question was meant for whoever wishes to answer, heh. But this begs the question - what can you do when you can&#039;t change the method because it&#039;s forced upon you? Admittedly I only have 25 weeks of school left, but it feels pretty long if I beat myself up daily for being such a friggin&#039; idiot unable to deal with what every person I know dealt with no problems.

I&#039;m just a bit sad, that&#039;s all. Especially if I end up failing the grade and having to repeat it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I don&#039;t know if the question is meant for Khatz but couldn&#039;t resist answering it. btw, my english is not so good so excuse me for any errors.
Answer: ABSOLUTELY! I only felt alive when I started &quot;deschooling&quot; myself! I HATED mathematics for decades only to find out that it&#039;s one of the most beautiful things I&#039;ve ever seen. So, definitely it&#039;s not me or anyone else, it&#039;s the school system that is completely flawed on all levels INCLUDING socialization (grading system is a s**t). But why say more when many fine articles in this blog can speak for me? :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: clothes...you only say that because you&#039;re a man.  Women routinely berate themselves for not fitting into those skinny jeans from last year rather than throwing them out and getting new ones that do fit.

I know that that&#039;s stupid (even though I&#039;ve done it many times), but I hadn&#039;t quite made the leap that fitting into any system is sort of the same thing.  I will try to remember this post the next time I&#039;m in a dark place for feeling like I don&#039;t fit in!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like most advice on this site, following this one creates a sort of endless logical loop.  Essentially AJATT is a method telling me not to trust or follow methods.  Thus if I listen to the advice, and stop following methods, I am following a method in order to it.  But if I continue listening to methods then I am by definition listening to methods. 

You&#039;re pretty slick, Khatz.  Writing advice that it is impossible not to follow.]]></description>
