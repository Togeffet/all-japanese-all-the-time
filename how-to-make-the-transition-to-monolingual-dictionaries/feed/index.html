					<description><![CDATA[If you go to the Table of Contents of this website (easy to find on the left sidebar or on the top of the page), you&#039;ll see that this post we&#039;re reading is crossed out.

It&#039;s not that there&#039;s no valuable content in here, it&#039;s just a very large post that kinda passes by the point Khatz really wanted to make. If you look in the post that&#039;s about monolingual dictionaries that isn&#039;t crossed out, he says to basically ignore this post.

To answer your question, in case you don&#039;t go read that post, you just need to look up really easy words you already know like  man（おとこ・男）, woman（おんな・女）, color（いろ・色）, blue（あお・青）, red (あか・赤）, fish (魚), sushi(You&#039;re on you&#039;re own here, man), etc.

					<description><![CDATA[I know sooner is always better, but when is it realistic to start using a monolingual dictionary?  At the very beginning? Partway through RTK?  Right when I start on sentences? After X number of sentences?

I realize there is no exact answer, but I&#039;m just starting AJATT and I&#039;m already beating myself up for not using a monodic even though I hardly know any kanji and only occasionally want to look-up words I hear in songs or on tv.  On the upside, Khatzumoto is completely successful at making me feel guilty every time I expose myself to English, but I&#039;d like to have a feasible idea of what&#039;s possible and how hard I should push myself.  

Thanks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m finding your method extremely useful for Japanese, and now I want to use it to brush up my French, a language I&#039;m way more familiar with. 

Because of that, I want to jump right into monolingual SRSing, but I&#039;m not really sure what an example monolingual card would look like for a European language like this (as in: no readings, etc.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OK, I&#039;m in. I have my monolingual dictionary and I&#039;m going through my SRS defining the key words instead of just having an English translation in the answer side. It&#039;s just Spanish I&#039;m learning so the process is a lot faster than I assume Japanese would be, but the same idea. I&#039;m going to try cold turkey, since most of the words in the definitions I&#039;ve at least seen/heard before but I just don&#039;t remember.

¡Gracias por la idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I have a couple of (sort of) dictionary related questions, if anyone can help?

First of all, can anyone recommend an &quot;offline&quot; dictionary; similar to Yahoo!辞書? Due to the nature of my work (moving around alot), I don&#039;t often have a reliable net connection, and I want to go monodic as soon as possible. So if anyone can recommend a good one (with example sentences), I&#039;d be eternally greatful!

Secondly, I&#039;m currently going through RTK, as I&#039;m basically starting my studies in Japanese studies from scratch (thanks AJATT!), can anyone tell me, once they get comfortable using a monodic, but perhaps they want to continue to revise old kanji, or learn new ones beyond the 2000 or so that are recommended, do they translate the RTK definitions into Japanese as well? I imagine it would be quite counter productive thinking of unknown kanji definitions in English - after all the whole point is to think and talk as a native speaker. Can anyone give some insight?

Other than that, thanks heaps Khatzumoto, I&#039;ll buy you a beer (I&#039;m serious) when I&#039;m fluent and back in Japan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know you say to go cold turkey and just make the move to a monolingual dictionary, but to be honest, I don&#039;t think thats going to help people that much, and heres why:

I look up a word. Any word. And then I look at the definition. Its in Japanese, a language which I don&#039;t know, but am trying to learn.

So one, I don&#039;t know what the word I&#039;m looking up means, and since I don&#039;t understand the language (hence why I looked up the word in the first place), I don&#039;t understand the definition of the word that comes out of the dictionary.

So I run around for 20 minutes looking up the words that come out of the dictionary, until I finally see something I understand, which is completely unrelated to the first word I looked up because I&#039;ve been clicking on links for so long.

Lemme explain it this way:

You look up Startrek on wiki because you don&#039;t know what Startrek is, you don&#039;t understand a word wiki is saying, so you keep clicking on likes. 10 minutes late, you open a page called Halflife. Startrek isn&#039;t Halflife. They&#039;re both science fiction, but thats pretty much where all the similarities stop ;)

Ok, sorry to sound like a huge ass, maybe I&#039;m just not at the right stage to start using a monolingual, but to be honest, how are we supposed to know when to make the jump?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thats great, thanks man... for anyone reading this (and if its only you khatzumoto and you never seen these before) I think this practice sentence package is pretty much what khatzumoto is talking about (excluding the fact that its all handed to you on a silver platter).

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;instead of using English right?
Yeah...and also...you should do your recursive lookups in Japanese, too (i.e. any lookups you may need to do of the definition). If these lookups are too complex/numerous for you right now, then pick easier sentences/words. So part of the deal becomes: if you&#039;re not ready to understand a word&#039;s definition in Japanese, then you&#039;re not ready to learn it...but you will be at some point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatzumoto, I really enjoy your site and now that I have a whole 4 months off from school, I&#039;m planning on finishing RTK1 before second year Japanese class ( time to eliminate the gap between kanji students and myself :) hehe)  I was recently studying a whole bunch of sentences and decided to take your advice and go monolingual, however, to no avail :&#124; This is what I came up with.

(My example sentence): くすりを一思いにのみこんだ。

Now in my case, I understand that くすり is medicine, and the rest I can vaguely make out has something to do with drinking it *duh* (のみ...). I had no idea what 一思いに meant, so I use yahoo辞書 

(The example sentence
that Yahoo辞書　gives
for 一思いに                 )  :  ［副］あれこれ迷わず、一気にそうするさま。思い切って。「いっそ―別れてくれ」
without Rikaichan *gotta love it* I would have no idea what any of this means, but regardless, your advice is to input this sentence with the rest into my anki&#039;s additional definitions instead of using English right?]]></description>
