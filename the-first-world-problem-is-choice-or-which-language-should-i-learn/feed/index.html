					<description><![CDATA[Another excellent piece of advice.  I remember good old times when discovering how much you actually _can_ do with the right ideas and resouces felt amazing, and it really is.  However, doing more and more of these discoveries eventually leads to frustration because resources are constrained but ideas are not.  So instead of celebrating every little thing that I can do I often begin to feel anxious about dozens of interesting things that I could be doing instead that I&#039;ve been trying to squeeze into my life for a long time already, but the tradeoffs involved always made it look unacceptable.  Fortunately the experience has taught me that sequencing actually works, so instead of worrying about whether I&#039;m doing the right thing I usually can instead just do it and see later how it goes.  I&#039;m not _trying_ to do anything, I&#039;m just choosing to do it by allocating the necessary resources and letting the nature and habit to do the rest.  And there usually aren&#039;t any wrong choices, really: either what I chose to do works and I can iterate it until it stops working or is no longer needed, or it doesn&#039;t work and then I&#039;ve learned something new and can use this knowledge in making further choices.  Now, paradoxically, it doesn&#039;t feel like I&#039;m doing anything at all and time just flies by, but in actuality lots of desired things happen and I definitely end up getting what I need much more often that I end up just wasting my time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like Cantonese a lot. I like the Chinese characters used Cantonese because they are pretty much as pure as it gets in the character using world. I still wish Japanese used pre-world war II Kanji still. Reading pre world war II books are really enjoying because I finally get to see some real traditional kanji. Still better than Mandarin, but Cantonese totally wins when it comes to characters.

I&#039;m currently with Japanese, but one day I will do ACATT too.

Jeez, I feel like I&#039;m a wannabe khatz sometimes :P]]></description>
