					<description><![CDATA[In response to Thomas (who probably is no longer checking the board)... what I have been doing is using the following:
1/4 -- failed, couldn&#039;t remember primitives or kanji at all.
2/4 -- remembered the primitives, story, etc., but got part wrong, or couldn&#039;t remember the order of the primitives
3/4 -- after some thinking and effort to remember the story, primitives, primitive arrangement, I got it, but it took some effort.
4/4 -- kanji pretty much jumped right into my head from the keyword without much effort.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Any similar recommendation on scoring Kanji? I&#039;m using Anki and I find that I usually mark stuff as 1/4 (failed) if I don&#039;t remember or 3/4 (Good) if I do, and I don&#039;t use the 2/4 or 4/4 options too often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;As you advance, you might want to narrow your grading down to the part of the sentence that you were aiming to learn (since you advance gradually, almost every new sentence will only be partially new to you). So there you have it, a rough guideline.&quot;

WOW!! sentences being partially new to me? HOW COOL. I cant wait to finish RTK1 so I can start on the amazing 10,000 sentence project!! I CANT WAIT to have really really long sentences!

AAA

I&#039;m SO STOKED!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To my knowledge, AntiMoon showed various types of QA pairs, but they settled on the last--the sentence/definition type. That&#039;s the kind I have used. It is basically the only kind I have used. It is the type I recommend on this site.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;ve read in other places on the site that you read antimoon.  I&#039;m trying to read antimoon and this site at the same time, so when I got to their part on using an SRS and how they do Q/A pairs I got really curious because I might have read this post in particular wrong.  I&#039;m not sure how good this explanation is going to be but here goes...

On antimoon they talk about doing different kinds of Q/A pairs, for example have some fill in the blank for grammar, some definitions...I don&#039;t know the other ones yet.  But you get the idea, there are a lot of different kinds of pairs.  So far when I&#039;m reading the site the way it seems that you use Japanese cards is you have one card with the Japanese sentence laid out for you (ie. not blank spaces for grammar) because you want to get the correct Japanese sentence in your head and not be storing the wrong input.  (Now that I&#039;m thinking about it, on the first repetition or two you might get that blank wrong but in the long term the input would be stored as the correct sentence, so that part shouldn&#039;t matter, right?)  Then in the definition card you have like the reading for the kanji, and definitions or whatever else you need to understand the sentence.  I&#039;m looking for some clarification on if the way I read it is actually how you do it or if you have more than one type of Q/A pair.  I haven&#039;t seen anything else about the pairs on the site except for the really brief snippet about having good Q/A pairs with context in this post.  Can you do a piece specifically about Q/A pairs since that&#039;s a rather significant part of making the cards, like different kinds to use, or could you correct how I&#039;m reading the site so far so I can get a better grasp on what to do before I get knee deep in [trouble]? :p Thanks!]]></description>
