					<description><![CDATA[But sometimes it&#039;s just so difficult to not post something you&#039;ve written to yourself ;-). It&#039;s funny though; people spend so much time arguing about what method is better, they forget to actually use the method they&#039;re a fan of. Even if they were using a sucky method and not discussing stupid stuff, they would learn more than propagating &quot;the perfect method&quot;.

That&#039;s actually the reason I quit blogging for about 5 months. Not that I&#039;m back I mostly ignore the haters and just write my advice down. For people that don&#039;t like my advice I only have one message: &quot;don&#039;t screw yourself, but just be aware I&#039;m ignoring you right now&quot;, and then I laugh. Not in public, no, just to myself.

Heck, I&#039;m not even arguing on forums or other blogs anymore. I just post my stuff, answer e-mails, answer comments whenever I can and just enjoy the next language I&#039;m learning. There are more important things in life, you know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks.  I needed to be told to stop trying to be a Ëè©Ëê® and save people from themselves.  If they enjoy boring classes and slow learning who I am to stop them?  Everyone needs a pointless hobby and it&#039;s less destructive than drugs.

That being said, I&#039;ve successfully pulled 2 people into Heisig who thought they were too old/dumb to learn characters...]]></description>

&quot;Start finding some grateful, paying, human customers[*winky face*].&quot;

There&#039;s a difference between forcing your opinions on others in an unwanted setting/place that is not yours and having a place of your own to express yourself where everyone knows &#039;YOU&#039; are what they&#039;re getting. If it&#039;s yours, you can do whatever you want. :]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this blog&#039;s purpose is to explain Khatzumoto&#039;s method and not to endlessly bash other methods. 

Instead of replying to these folks posts we should type the response onto a text document. They&#039;ll eventually accumulate over time and we could revise and correct it. I&#039;ve never thought of this. Great advise.]]></description>
