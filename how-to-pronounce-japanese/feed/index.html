					<description><![CDATA[&#062;If you‚Äôre a guy, you should pick a guy to copy; and girls should pick a girl.

As a male to female transsexual who is still living as male, i was wondering which would be appropriate for me. Should I imitate a man since that&#039;s what people still see me as, or should I imitate a woman, since that&#039;s what I want to be. Should i do both so I can have all my bases covered?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you say to talk like a robot, do you mean to separate the syllables out and speak slowly? So, for example, Â•Ω„Åç is pronounced almost like &quot;ski,&quot; but the syllables are „Åô and „Åç. Should you pronounced each of them slowly, and equally? I get tongue tied sometimes (only about 40 sentences in, now). I&#039;m trying to pronounce them like the Text-to-Speech does it, and it works sometimes, but other times I struggle with it and sit there repeating it over and over until I get it right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hahahahaha.

Thanks God my mother tongue is Spanish so the 5 vowels that Japanese has Spanish has them too.
So in pronunciation is quite easier for a Spanish speaker pronounce  the Japanese vowels.
Anyway is quite difficult in sometimes.

But dont worry I tried the &quot;eddie&quot; exercise and is pretty good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Luke,

My accent is pretty much just British, without any regional bias.  I moved around a lot as a child in the UK and then went to boarding schools so never picked up a local accent as such.  Most people guess London as it&#039;s definately southern over northern, but that&#039;s about it.

Strangely I&#039;ve never been able to put on accents.  I can&#039;t even do Scottish and my mum speaks with a scottish accent!!

Like I said I guess it&#039;s that I knew what I was listening for when saying &#039;eddie&#039;.  Don&#039;t forget to say it quickly.  I&#039;m not claiming that it&#039;s a perfect for for „Åà„Çä but it gets you in the right place to just tune it with practice.  Just really listen to yourself and think about what your mouth/tongue is doing...

Honestly, within two weeks of reading about it in a book I was using it in my Japanese without even thinking about it.]]></description>

&#062;The sound ‚Äúr‚Äù (Obviously ;-P I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äúeddie‚Äù trick works with British English!)

Well I&#039;m British and it obviously worked for me.  Although, I had been living in Japan for a year before I came across it so I guess I was pretty tuned in to the sound that I was trying to make and &#039;Eddie&#039; helped me achieve that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Luke

&gt;The glottal stop (shown by a small tsu at the end of a word)
As far as I know, that isn&#039;t pronounced as such. It&#039;s just used sort of as an exclamation mark, to indicate that the sound was abrupt (this is usually the case in shouting). Examples:
ÂÆâ„Å£ÔºÅis just pronounced &quot;„É§„ÇπÔºÅÔºÅ&quot; , you might say it when something is cheap (low price). You just kind of shorten the end of the last vowel.

&gt;The vowel ‚Äúu‚Äù (unlike ‚Äúu‚Äù in English/Spanish etc., it‚Äôs a close back compressed vowel)Ôºû
The key to this is that it&#039;s more of a &quot;ew&quot; than an &quot;oo&quot;.

Anyway, I don&#039;t know of any websites that do this (if you find one let me know). But even if you never find one, you can still do perfectly well without it. You needn&#039;t analyze it really, just listen carefully to people and focus on imitating them as closely as you can. You&#039;ll figure it out; your brain and your body are designed for it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heya Khatzumoto! (I apologise about the above post - that was me. Something was playing up, and my posts weren&#039;t getting through.)

I was wondering if you knew of any software/websites that show how to pronounce Japanese. I used the following site; http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/ to learn Spanish pronunciation really well and wondered if such a thing existed for the Japanese language. I&#039;ve searched, but to no avail.

There are quite a few sounds which are bugging me:
The vowel &quot;u&quot; (unlike &quot;u&quot; in English/Spanish etc., it&#039;s a close back compressed vowel)
The sound &quot;r&quot; (Obviously ;-P I don&#039;t think the &quot;eddie&quot; trick works with British English!)
The sound &quot;fu&quot;
The sound &quot;hi&quot; (its &quot;h&quot; is slightly different to the &quot;h&quot; of &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;ho&quot; and &quot;he&quot;)
The glottal stop (shown by a small tsu at the end of a word)

It&#039;s driving me crazy! Any help would be really appreciated! Accent is of course the biggest giveaway! 

Still, I&#039;d like to congratulate you on the great site! Keep up the good work and good luck with the Chinese! :-)

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;Is it possible to use your Khatzumemo for other languages?
Yes, it is. You can use it with any language you can enter into a computer.

&gt;Would I have to create a new log-on and password for each language?
No, you don&#039;t. However, as of the current version, everything would be mixed together in the same collection (I don&#039;t think this is a bad thing, but I might add separation functionality if a lot of people want it).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well I&#039;d love to take all the credit, but like you I borrowed it from somewhere else.  Thing is, I don&#039;t remember where.  I&#039;m sure it&#039;s a book though...
Of course, the repetition to musical beat is all my own.  I always had to make sure to stop when I was at lights in case anyone heard me.  Oh, it&#039;s hard driving an open top car sometimes :D]]></description>
