					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I own www.canton168.com I think the Eldon you&#039;re mentioning as Eldon Reeves? No? K nvm... but another friend of mine Wai Ming mentioned your website to mine. I was wondering if you would be interested in joining a network of Cantonese related sites to further the cantonese language and culture (Eldon helped me developed this idea) well if you&#039;re interested, drop me a mail or visit the forums :) Thanks

P.S. how he said there&#039;s a lack of learning materials? yeah my goal&#039;s also to change that]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[^ It&#039;s really common to drop the ng sound in a lot of words now.  Kinda like how the n- initial&#039;s disappearing in favour of l-.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s anything to get annoyed about though.  Languages won&#039;t ever stop evolving.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In regards to your number 2 note up there, I&#039;ve learnt that it should be Èáç, but have seen my Cantonese friends write the other one. I&#039;ve also heard native speakers (especially the young ones) pronounce Êàë as &quot;oh&quot; instead of &quot;ngo&quot; which really bothers me too, but hey what can you do!]]></description>
