					<description><![CDATA[Haha, you think that drawing&#039;s bad? Some mangakas like, really really really suck at drawing. Their proportions make me twitch physically. In Tokyo Crazy Paradise, there are many many scenes where like... the head is like.... 1/10 the size of the body. No joke. But I am capable of reading terrible manga, unless the art is absolutely horrifying.

I would comment on the actual point of this post but I don&#039;t really have much to add. :P I will be sure to check out that manga..... later. (good manga makes me want to read the translation so I know what&#039;s going on, so I&#039;m sticking with repetitive shoujo that I still somehow find entertaining)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a weird looking manga. But thanks for the recommendation, I took a look at it and it looks good. It&#039;s on my queue for reading.

I also wrote up a bunch of recommendations for anime, manga, and movies here, if anybody&#039;s interested:

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, as soon as you had mentioned this series on your Twitter Tweets updates, I got the series and have been watching it.  Of course, I don&#039;t understand much of it, but there&#039;s still much to gain from context, and overall, it&#039;s VERY interesting.  I find myself watching a whole disc when I only wanted to watch one episode.  Really good stuff!  I&#039;m on disc 4 right now, and hopefully I&#039;ll start mining from it when I watch the series the second time around.

I was thinking of ordering the manga, but you pointed out that it doesn&#039;t have furigana.  That wouldn&#039;t really be problem, but likely would take more time to look them up.  To tell you the truth, I think I might get them anyways because when I&#039;ve mined and read manga in the past, those little furigana seem to get caught up in my view unintentionally.  Thanks for the recommendation!

And daaaaaaaaaaang mommy long-legs with man hands! LOL]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the first manga I read was GTO, so I was kind of spoiled from the beginning in terms of illustration quality.  The story I am reading now was clearly a case of &quot;I have a story, but I can&#039;t draw very well,&quot; but you can tell that the artist was getting better as he drew it (it&#039;s called „Éâ„É©„Ç¥„É≥Ê°ú - has a drama).  For the ultimate in non-sequentiality, try „ÇØ„É¨„É®„É≥„Åó„Çì„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì, each story is about 3 pages long!  Or watch episodes of the cartoon on youtube, where each one is 7-8 minutes long (they are HILARIOUS).]]></description>
