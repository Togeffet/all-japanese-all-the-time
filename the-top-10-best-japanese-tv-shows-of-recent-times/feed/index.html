					<description><![CDATA[
Thanks for this list 

and at the guy above me.. that is part of the glory of Japanese TV...  Japanese tv shows work differently, They are created differently, and despite the budgets they are given to shoot with they make it work! and rarely they are given another season to extend their story...

I highly recommend &quot;My boss my hero&quot; if noone has seen it, but im sure if you have iwgp on the list you have... It was great.

Is any of that show on DVD or is it just a weekly TV event or something?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[花ざかりの君たちへ:イケメンパラダイス   (Hanazakari no Kimitachi he : Ikemen Paradaisu)
Usually found under the shortened  Hana Kimi.

Is the name of the Show Khatz mentioned that was made in Taiwan from a Japanese Manga and then remade in Japan.

Highly recomend the Japanese version also.  Staring the ever lovely Maki Horikita.   Can be found on Veoh and the like if you don&#039;t want to fork out for the DVD.. altho it probably will come with the subs hardwired.  But Just watch it a few times to get the story and then use it as background sound and pick from there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi there-
I came across your blog the other day and I have to say I&#039;m really impressed with it! I am also a student of Japanese who believes that when learning a language, it&#039;s extremely important to get lots of input, and that it&#039;s also important to make your language-learning fun by watching and listening to things that interest you ^^
Anyways when I opened this list, I was very pleasantly surprised to see エンタの神様 at the top. I think that watching (and trying to understand!) Japanese comedy is one of the best things you can do to sharpen your listening skills, and I watch this show every weekend and love it. I&#039;m even trying to get my Japanese-studying co-worker into it because I think it&#039;s a great show.
Anyways, keep up the great work :D]]></description>
