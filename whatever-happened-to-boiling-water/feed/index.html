					<description><![CDATA[Pretty much what Drew said. Here&#039;s what makes me pretty sure it doesn&#039;t count as input: If you take any two people, one who SRS&#039;s hours a day, using lots of pre-made decks. And one who SRS&#039;s moderately, maybe a single hour a day, reviewing things they found on their own, and then devotes those remaining hours to input. The second person will advance much quicker, and be less likely to burn out. The second because all that input is a lot more fun than hours and hours of working through shit someone mined from a JLPT study guide, the first because real media from native sources is absolutely essential to growth. The SRS just can&#039;t replace. Smart.fm, using subs2srs, things like that which get multimedia on the card brings it closer, but it still just doesnt seem to have the same overall effect as kicking back and watching a few hours a day of unsubbed anime, reading a book, and listening to japanese music as often as possible while you go about your business.  Fortunately, its not an either/or, and they compliment each other perfectly. Almost like...insulation and a pot of boiling water.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about experimenting with this for a while. 

The one part that might work, I&#039;m thinking, is that if you shuffle these bits and pieces (coming from different places; such as 2 minutes of Japanese one hour, and 2 minutes of Cantonese a little bit after that in the same hour, and repeat for every hour after that), you could possibly master a couple of different languages at the same time in the same process.

Although I&#039;m not sure if they&#039;d just interrupt each other. Guess it&#039;ll be mine and your task, as well, to experiment with this to the best of our abilities?

					<description><![CDATA[One element missing in your metaphor is the SRS. Keeping up with your daily SRS reps is like buying more insulation for the pan. Nope, it will NEVER make the water boil on its own. But it drastically decreases the amount of heat and the amount of time needed to bring the water to boil in an almost indirect way. Sure, for example, you could just do input, frequently looking up words you don&#039;t know in the dictionary, and eventually, with enough input, close enough together, for a long enough period of time, the water will boil. But, by keeping those words you look up in the SRS, and keeping them in long term memory through your reviews, you only have to look that word up the first time. And you benefit from that single look-up more immediately, getting more out of your input right away. The SRS can&#039;t ever replace good old fashioned books, audio and video, but it damn sure supplements the process nicely.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is how many poor people without heat keep warm in the winter.
Be careful with all this turning on and turning off though, if you have a gas stove.  But then again, if you&#039;re coming back to the stove frequently anyway, you&#039;ll notice if you forgot to turn it completely off earlier.]]></description>
