					<description><![CDATA[Hey Patrick,

could you please tell me where do you download all that music? I usually get everything from kickasstorrents, but could not find the stuff you recommend over there.

Many thanks!

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;It‚Äôs now a self-sustaining reaction producing pure spiral energy&quot;
That is the best possible line, and I needed that. Really. That got me pumped for the now and the future, and although it doesn&#039;t feel like a chore now, it feels weird doing this. 

Today is my 4th day into the AJATT life, and I&#039;m still feeling a bit confused about the whole thing, so I&#039;m trying to pep myself up. Been listening to The Pillows and Bump of Chicken all day [because it&#039;s the only Japanese music I have right now, and although I love them like crazy right now, I will go insane if I don&#039;t get more music, hahaha], and I&#039;m reminded of why I enjoy rock [which I haven&#039;t heard much of in ages, as I&#039;ve been a hardcore techno guy for a few years]. 

...and having my OS in Japanese is driving me nuts, because right now I&#039;m only able to use my computer by having memorized the layout of where things are [or hoping the control is in katakana so I can just read it]...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From a mainly rock perspective, i&#039;ll provide more support for: 

Asian Kung-Fu Generation - More recent stuff is usually a chill sort of rock, bit like Weezer(?). First album more punk-ish.

Boris - (I believe they&#039;ve straddled most genres ;) though I think they&#039;re best playing stoner rock)

Radwimps - lots of influences here. When done right - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MaF-bWeLGw (singing along to this one is great)

Sakanaction - indie/alt electronic. Ranges from more atmospheric songs to songs great for Karaoke (like  „Ç¢„É´„ÇØ„Ç¢„É©„Ç¶„É≥„Éâ)

9mm Parabellum Bullet - post-hardcore type of rock, though they have some good slower songs, ie; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmawA9Jns14.

The Pillows - very prolific alt rock band - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4_Qzx-E2LQ

Suneohair - calming light rock - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5Vi3wfo_Yw

Ogre you asshole - calming and often odd alt-rock

Sukima Switch - jazzy pop/rock - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q1anDhjRoM

YUI - female singer, pop/rock 

and some that deserve a mention:

DOES - garage-rock - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aejQJ-vUE_g.

Number Girl - alt/indie rock with some great guitar work, very influential - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJJPvFK4pEQ

Andymori - fairly new band, energetic indie-rock - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk80Mb_9sXI

SID - more like visual kei, also good for sing-alongs - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFixbptQ7ik

Ling Tosite Sigure/Rin Toshite Shigure/Âáõ„Å®„Åó„Å¶ÊôÇÈõ® - post-hardcore, pretty progressive with lots of tempo changes and still very catchy (probably my favourite japanese band!) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4tA1I0e3PE]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not particularly that I know of. You&#039;d probably have to look at bands from the 80&#039;s.

However, I highly recommend looking through as many B&#039;z songs as you can find. I&#039;m sure at least a few will fit that style, but if it doesn&#039;t work for ya, sorry.¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I won&#039;t introduce you to any nuanced/rare bands because I figure if you want those, you&#039;ll have to look deep on your own. But here&#039;s a lot of AWESOME mainstream stuff. It beats most mainstream American music easily.


B&#039;z -- It&#039;s like the contemporary Beatles of Japan. Most people know them, but for those that don&#039;t, you&#039;ll probably find a myriad of songs you like by them (unless you can&#039;t stand rock).

Asian Kung-Fu Generation -- ¬†Tons of songs that are sorta in an alternative rock genre, and they just have a feel that you&#039;d have to listen to in order to understand.

HOME MADE ÂÆ∂Êóè -- They have some pretty mainstream hiphop/pop/rap-type stuff. Funky beats that keep ya listenin&#039;.

L&#039;Arc~en~Ciel -- They&#039;re sorta like a punk rock scene (god, I&#039;m not good with genres), but they have this really emotional feel to most of their songs.

FLOW -- They do a -lot- of anime songs. They&#039;re mostly upbeat and really catchy. Check &#039;em out.


There are more bands I could mention, but I usually just have like 1-20 of their songs because I picked up an album or a few singles from hearing them in an anime opening. That&#039;s one of the greatest ways to find catchy music: watch anime.¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been looking for music to listen to for a while. I prefer metal, but finding Japanese metal that doesn&#039;t have screamed lyrics or English lyrics (or both) has been hard. Though I found two bands yesterday that I&#039;ve been listening to, mostly cause I like their sound, I still don&#039;t understand much Japanese... and they still scream some, but not a lot.
Girugamesh- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blO7HGp8JdU&#038;feature=related
Thousand Leaves- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh5bhphkBMw&#038;feature=related
If you want to find more bands (and you like metal) watch these videos,
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRTOkvMcpoA&#038;feature=related
there are six episodes out right now. This guy was nice enough to compile segments from many bands for people like us.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,
¬†
All these JP bands are poppy man.
Anyone have bands that are more like classic rock or early british punk bands? Or early glam rock?
Like Thin Lizzy, Judas Priest, London Suede, Sex Pistols, The (Southern Death) Cult, David Bowie, etc?

					<description><![CDATA[Gackt used to be in MALICE MIZER
which i find to be much better than him alone
his voice was stronge, his lyrics were more human, more diverse, more different
and he used to play the the piano. i ask you: WHERE IS THAT AMAZINGNESS NOW??

tetsu and Gaz dropped out early. whatever became of tehm, look on wiki.
mana hung around and created Moi dix mois
Kami passed away, Rest in Peace.
kozi has an excellent solo project, was in Eve of Destiny and now is in XA-VAT along with a member of caligari 
&#038; Yu~ki kinda dropped off the map
p.s. Gackt is actually a bit infamous. Unpopular opinion: he has kind of sold out.  He is more of a game show host than a musician and has had a lot of plastic surgery.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to put my two cents in as far as &quot;sites for music&quot; goes. The one site I go to to get up to date on my fav artists as well as learning about some new ones is http://www.jpopasia.com/

For most songs (Japanese, Korean, and Chinese), you will have the translated lyrics, romaji lyrics, and then the Kanji lyrics. You can then scroll down and see the artist&#039;s previous hits. Even if there isn&#039;t a video, you can search the artist&#039;s lyrics and some of them will have some combination of the T/R/K lyrics. There is even a section about which songs are topping the Oricon Chart. 

I just started to put music and lyrics into my SRS (and loving it, I had to cut myself off because it was almost 2 am XD ) and I know I&#039;ll be getting a lot of my lyrics and whatnot from Jpopasia.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Going to add my own suggestions for music as well as one album you should get (even if they have many good albums)

„ÅÑ„Åç„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åå„Åã„Çä / ikimono gakari - &quot;My song your song&quot; 

YeLLOW Generation - &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;

Ore Ska Band - &quot;Wao!!&quot;

Missile Innovation - &quot;Be a Man&quot;

All are like pop/hip hop/alt tones. they&#039;re great for learning the language because the vocalists are really clear.

Now, for my request.

If anyone knows of an artist named Nujabes. He&#039;s Japanese. Well, was Japanese. He&#039;s the king of jazzical hip hop... but he died. And his music has english lyrics.

I&#039;m humbly requesting that if anyone knows of anyone of the caliber of Nujabes with beautiful instrumentals and great features like him, please let me know on my blog or in these comments. I beg of you. He is my favorite artist but I can&#039;t listen to him because he&#039;s English lyrics (despite being Japanese! FU!!&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a seriously long time lurker, but I felt the need to post about this.  I really like this article, not only because Khatz is talking about just DOING Japanese (Or L2 in general.) but because it stresses it for those of us who tend to try to intellectualize everything.

I can&#039;t tell you how often I do that.  I must find a clear cut method, clear cut instructions, a step-by-step guide that tells me exactly what I need to do and exactly what steps I need to take and what each of those steps are going to do to help me achieve my goal.  I don&#039;t know if that was upbringing/education or simply something some people do that others don&#039;t, but when you&#039;re trying to do something like learn Japanese, you really need to just do it.

Because you won&#039;t understand.  Understanding the process is counter-productive to learning the process.  This has been said many times before, but it doesn&#039;t matter how many books you read about people who know how to speak Japanese, you&#039;re not going to learn it yourself until you start speaking and listening and immersing.  You just need to DO it.  Stop thinking altogether!

Something about the human mind requires you to actually experience before you are able to reproduce.  Educational instutes would have you believing otherwise, but you really need to do something before you can do it yourself.

I haven&#039;t mastered Japanese yet, but I can tell you that I&#039;ve learned the most in the shortest amount of time when I was actively listening and speaking, rather than trying to find out how I&#039;m going to start listening and speaking effectively.  You learn on the way; while doing.  Not beforehand.]]></description>
