					<description><![CDATA[For some reason, the quote &quot;If you&#039;re in a hurry, take the scenic route.&quot; stuck with me for a long time. Mostly because it didn&#039;t feel right. Of course, I tried to compare it to two students on their way to school saying, &quot;Since we&#039;re gonna be late anyways, let&#039;s just take our time.&quot; But that&#039;s not quite the same, because now they aren&#039;t in a hurry.

Finally, I decided to translate the derned Japanese to my second language, Korean. And now it makes so much more sense.
&quot;If you&#039;re in a hurry, turn around.&quot; So rather than taking the scenic route and stressing on the way while trying to go fast, you just stop. You stop, turn around, and choose to do something else. Maybe it takes you on towards the place you wanted to go. Maybe it takes you to another place, but the thing is, you&#039;re happy.

Thanks Cats!]]></description>
