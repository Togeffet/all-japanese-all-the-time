					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely fantastic article.

Rock In China is a fantastic resource for finding rock, metal, hip hop, and jazz artists.
http://www.rockinchina.com/w/Main_Page

I also search for dubs on video sharing websites of popular english movies dubbed into mandarin.
There&#039;s absolutely tons of them out there.

I can&#039;t really seem to find many english TV shows in mandarin though, come across a couple like South Park and some other cartoons like Spider-Man and Batman but that&#039;s about it.
Anyone know if any good shows have been dubbed?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good list! One thing: eMule does indeed get 和谐d, which is clear for whenever you search for politically sensitive stuff.  So annoying.  

Also Amazon.cn *sometimes* accepts my US credit cards and *sometimes* won&#039;t.  I&#039;ve written them for help, but their tech support has much to be desired.

Pleco is NOT cheap but it IS awesome.  In the US itunes store anyway, it&#039;s $150 for the full suite ($100 for students--on the honor system), and it&#039;s worth paying to get the full version.  (It doesn&#039;t work when you lose service though, so looking up words when you&#039;re stuck in the subway is not going to happen.)

I also love nciku (http://www.nciku.com/) when I don&#039;t have my iPhone handy--it lets you write in characters like pleco does, but isn&#039;t as picky as some other sites at how pretty it looks.  It has two Chinese-English dictionaries and a Chinese-Chinese one, and lots of example sentences.  (It&#039;s not perfect, though, and their new Japanese dictionary is really not there yet.)

Last thing: the best way to get a handle on how real Chinese people speak is to venture on the BBSs, which are full of slang and in-jokes.  It can be a little overwhelming at first, so you may want to check out Chinasmack.com, which translates some of the most popular threads and gives a slang dictionary.  Hard-core people may want to check out the new book on Chinese slang, Niu Bi! (http://www.amazon.com/Niubi-Chinese-Never-Taught-School/dp/0452295564). It is, like, crazy dirty but so, so handy online.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This should be immensely helpful; I&#039;ve been looking for new places to find content :)

one (slightly) related question: How do you keep your Chinese SRS sentences short? You mentioned before that you like to copy out your sentences, which I do as well, but they&#039;re always far too long to produce without getting a huge cramp. When I try to make my sentences shorter, they always end up being context-less phrases that don&#039;t really mean anything interesting by themselves. Any advice?]]></description>
