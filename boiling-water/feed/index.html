					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m reading this article again for the first time in a few years.

It&#039;s interesting how the ideology of AJATT has morphed over the years. The mantra now seems like, &quot;Some Japanese, Most of the Time&quot;.

I find that interesting because the method that includes short breaks is probably perceived as an easier route to fluency. But I think the keep-the-heat-on way is actually the easier way to go.

The goal seems more clear cut, when every decision you make is one to deepen your immersion.

I don&#039;t know, that&#039;s just my two yen. It&#039;s been a while since I visited AJATT so I guess I&#039;ve got some catching up to do :)]]></description>

I had Japanese private teacher for over 2 years, did selfstudy in Japanese for 1.5 years and then had to stop taking lessons when I moved abroad. (could not afford it) Now I want to continue my studies, and really I forgot a lot since the 1 year break, even tho I watch Japanese TV shows or anime daily, or listen to J-pop I try to stop taking beraks, and finding excuses. Everyone has at least 10-20 minutes a day before you go to sleep the read thrugh your kanji&#039;s or to learn a few new ones. I have a fulltime job and a part time job (7 days a week) so I can not study 18-24 hours a day like you do. :( I will still try, I started labeling all items in my room with their Japanese names, and I bought myself the laminated Kanjiposter advertised on your site, I will read your site daily yo get fresh motivation, and to feed the fire I need for boiling my water.]]></description>
