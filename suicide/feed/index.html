					<description><![CDATA[[E]ven suicide, perhaps the greatest expression of sadness and despair possible, requires a positive, Babe Ruth homerun mindset.

Not always. The original latin apparently means - self-kill. So to run into a brick wall at 90 while under the influence is suicide. Falling off a ladder whilst cleaning the drains is suicide. Forgetting to remove all the bullets before seeing if you&#039;ve fixed the trigger problem whilst scratching your head with the barrel is suicide. I shall stop here.

Though, not all suicides are expressions of despair. Believe it or not some folks just are not interested in living. They just don&#039;t like or &quot;get&quot; life. Sort of like walking out on a movie. I think suicides have been greatly misrepresented and maligned by the &quot;other side&quot;. Sometimes it takes more guts, maturity, depth and love for life and self to take the initiative rather than cling to breath no matter what. But, to each his/her own. 

Good point though. No one will ever match the success a suicide reaches. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for writing a big long post. I have been struggling to move my ass and learn Japanese, and this has inspired me. I just need to take one step at a time, and eventually I&#039;ll have climbed the stairs to fluency :D]]></description>
