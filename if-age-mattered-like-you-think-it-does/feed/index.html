					<description><![CDATA[Actually that&#039;s a really good point, most language learners are somewhere around the level of a toddler or slightly older child, not an adult, and should therefore be using the materials and methods that would work for such a person (for the most part, with minor adjustments e.g. listening to music or watching movies that might not be appropriate for a young child).

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been trying a lot to remember this lately, so this post was certainly appreciated. I constantly get frustrated because I&#039;m trying to function at the same level in Japanese as I can in English, despite not having spent nearly the same amount of time with Japanese. Instead of trying to instantly be a Japanese 25 year old, I probably need to accept being a Japanese toddler for a while - with the compensatory knowledge that at least it shouldn&#039;t take another 20 years before I can use Japanese the way I want to.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It literally makes physically angry every time I hear someone use the old excuse.

Why? Because they actually believe it. In my experience if you try to tell them otherwise they will retaliate and give you all of the reasons in the world why they&#039;re too old (most of my friends are only 18-22 to add insult to the wound) to learn.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[yeah, I completely agree. Actually I wrote/recorded a very similar post on my own blog a while back ( http://bit.ly/U5sIOp ) 

It almost amazes me how people compare themselves to people who&#039;ve been speaking a language 10,20,30 odd years longer than they have, and then get all neurotic because they&#039;re not as good.]]></description>
