					<description><![CDATA[I always wanted to know what a Godan or Ichidan verb is, so I looked it up now - it&#039;s actually quite interesting to look at grammar explanations once you know the real stuff &quot;by heart&quot; - You go like¬† „Äå„ÅÇ„ÅÇ„ÄÄ„Åù„ÅÜ„Å™„Çì„Å†„Äç...
This reminds me of a scene from a Japanese class I took for 1 month (expensive as hell, and left with a big &#039;I&#039;ll never be able to do this&#039; after each lesson) The teacher was explaining something about &#039;consonant&#039; and &#039;vowel&#039; verbs and then we took turns conjugating them. When it was my turn, I had &#039;to meet - „ÅÇ„ÅÜ&#039;. I figured since it had only vowels it MUST be a vowel verb - HOW could it be a consonant verb it there is no consonant in it whatsoever??? It was frustrating... I so wanted to take this case to the highest Japanese grammar authority - how could something be a consonant verb if it doesn&#039;t have consonants??? 
Yeah, grammar is stupid, it does not always make sense, it just describes the language as it is naturally used - it should only be used to explain a language, it&#039;s not a vehicle to learn it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot! :D ^^ 
¬†
Well, um do you do anything to help you form the Kanji together on paper? I can&#039;t really write it correctly on paper but I do know what the primitives are. Not sure how to make a story that&#039;ll help that. :C]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I would sit down and learn like my 20 at once. Creating stories and then writing them into a log. I would devour notebook papers, cuz I would write every single rep, which I guess could be inconvenient for some, but I was a middle schooler with a lot of free time back then. I would have like 250 reps a day which would take me maybe 45 mins to an hour tops.
¬†
When I got my android phone in the summer, I got ankidroid and lazy kanji just to try out the lazy kanji deck. Though I guess I don&#039;t use it like it was intended, because what I do is I just look at the kanji and do keywords. My plain RTK deck was creation (writing kanji) and the lazy kanji was only used for recognition, So i don&#039;t care for the stories. 
¬†
I just use the lazy kanji mod deck (i think it&#039;s called that) that was created by some dude. He set his cards like
&lt;strong&gt;Front&lt;/strong&gt;
Ë≥Ñ
you _____ for some &lt;strong&gt;SHELLS&lt;/strong&gt; so you could &lt;strong&gt;POSSESS&lt;/strong&gt; them (just made that story xD)
&lt;strong&gt;Back&lt;/strong&gt;
bribe
¬†
Kanji + story with primitives capitalized on front, keyword on back.
Then again, I don&#039;t use lazy kanji like it was meant to be used, I just wanted a quick deck for recognition :P

					<description><![CDATA[That actually sounds pretty impressive though! You&#039;re a third of the way there, and by the sounds of it, you&#039;re also picking up steam!

For the first few months of my sentence phase, I didn&#039;t get very far; I had a bad game plan. Essentially, every few days, I&#039;d shove a bunch of sentences down my throat, choke on them for a few days, and once it appeared that I had finally digested them, I&#039;d repeat the process. This worked, but my growth was very slow. 
¬†
Then, about a month ago, I made a new deck for fun. I decided to add only five sentences to it each day. It wasn&#039;t long before I noticed that this new deck was growing faster than my old one, and on top of that, I was retaining more too. 
¬†
Now, both decks are on the five-a-day plan, so I suppose I do 10 a day.
¬†
Anyway, I mention this because I feel like I&#039;m now on track, and hearing of your success is really giving me motivation to keep going, no matter what the pace. (My brain: &quot;Alright! Now that we&#039;re on track, one day, we&#039;ll be as good as „É©„Ç§„Éà„Éã„É≥„Ç∞!&quot;) :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Only on a few kanji like Á¥Ø„ÄÄand Á¥∞ where the primitives are. I use a plain keyword to kanji deck on my PC where I started, and use Lazy Kanji with Ankidroid for my Droid X. What I like about lazy kanji is the word doesn&#039;t have to be exact. There are times when I forgot the english keyword but used the japanese so much that I had a sort of japanese meaning for it, or just a true understand without any english, but still gets wrong in plain RTK !!

					<description><![CDATA[Sadly, around 9 months. I&#039;m pretty inconsistent to be honest. There were multiple weeks in a row when I got ~20 or more, but then times when I felt only like doing 5 a day because I couldn&#039;t be bothered. I would say my worst time was last year at the end of 8th grade, when I kept going around 5 a day, but finally got my act together at the start of this school year xD¬†

I&#039;m still not sure about the format really so I tried and made my own.¬† Lately it&#039;s been getting on my nerves though. I keep getting angry when I can&#039;t get a certain kanji right..mostly with writing though. I was going to switch to RTK but I have trouble with how to remember where to place primitives. I&#039;m not sure how to make stories with them so I&#039;m pretty stuck. Did you have problems with primitive placement? : o]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I felt like that at first, had a little rough road with kanji and stuff. Great motivation until 1100, fell into a ditch. Though the whole time, i was doing it in secrecy. Then when my dad found me doing RTK, i explained everything and stuff, which is truly when i flourished. For the last 700 I just pwned it with huge motivation. Now i&#039;m at 3000 sentences :D
What i have to say is just choose one and stick with it. If it gives results, stay, if not, find another one, and repeat until you find a way of learning that is best for you.]]></description>

Though the whole time, i was doing it in secrecy. Then when my dad found me doing RTK, i explained everything and stuff, which is truly when i flourished. For the last 700 I just pwned it with huge motivation. Now i&#8217;m at 3000 sentences üòÄ<br />
What i have to say is just choose one and stick with it. If it gives results, stay, if not, find another one, and repeat until you find a way of learning that is best for you.</p>

In real life, it means you&#039;ll have to remember the &quot;steps&quot; to produce whatever you want to say, while your conversation partner waits impatiently, and worst of all, everything you hear will seem so fast while you try to figure out that Ë°å„Å£„Åü is the past and plain form of the &quot;ikimasu&quot; you learnt in Beginner Lesson 8: Sumisu-san goes to Tokyo (ostensibly to watch kabuki, although we all know there were some shady business deals involved) and wonder why native speakers don&#039;t speak more slowly for poor foreigners like you.]]></description>
