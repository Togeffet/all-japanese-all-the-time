					<description><![CDATA[Hey Aaron, I&#039;m also into electronic music but I haven&#039;t checked out Coppé. Will definitely be looking her up when I get the chance later today. Out of curiosity, what other groups were you able to find? It seems easy to find electronic music but often times it can be too poppy for my taste. So far my favorite electronic artist I&#039;ve found is immi. You can look her up on itunes if you haven&#039;t found her yourself yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ACID BLACK CHERRY( aka A.B.C.) is a very good (pop-rock?) band. Yasu&#039;s vocal&#039;s are even better than the amazing guitarmanship--it&#039;s pretty awesome. The whole band has tons of energy, so their lives never, ever dissapoint. Definitely my new favorite band. If you Yasu&#039;s vocals, he also used to sing for a band calle Janne da Arc. A couple links:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8Bo-67CGas
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_ejpsS1vUY&#038;feature=channel
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzfr7_fkT0c&#038;feature=channel

But no matter what type of music your&#039;e interested in, I would recommend subscribing to the avex music channel on Youtube. Avex owns all the biggest, most popular, (best and worst) Japanese bands and groups. That includes giants like Ayumi Hamasaki, GACKT, AAA, and ACID BLACK CHERRY. 

Also good: RADWIMPS, HYDE, FLICK(rap), AAA(kind of a cute group, alot of fun), m-flo, LUNCHTIME SPEAX, Tommyheavenly6, Malice Mizer(w/Gackt; probably one of the first Visual Kei bands ever), BROTHERS ON THE RUN

GACKT then: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OrqyUgelU
GACKT now: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYYcuEcYD_8
Due to GACKT&#039;s wide popularity, theres also alot of interviews, commercial sound bytes and things like that for listening. Even if you dislike his music, everything else he does is hilarious. So extra kudos to gackt.

Thanks kiba for posting some really good stuff!
Peace out,

					<description><![CDATA[Does ANYBODY know any GOOD Japanese rock and/or metal bands? I&#039;ve been searching everywhere on the internet, but so many people think visual kei=metal, which isn&#039;t the case at all. I listen to American bands like Metallica, Sevendust, Megadeth, Slipknot,etc. for metal, and for regular rock, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Rolling Stones, Poison, and once again Sevendust. Punk rock is fine too. And anything like the following bands. ESPECIALLY Jinn and HIGH AND MIGHTY COLOR.

To add to the list: Crazy Ken Band--very jazzy, and bluesy, &quot;タイガー＆ドラゴン” was the theme for the drama of the same name.ガールフレンドis good too.
Rock: Bump of Chicken, Sambomaster--Hikari no Rock, Jinn, HIGH AND MIGHTY COLOR, UVERworld(&quot;Rush&quot; is good, the rest are okay)
Pop: Yui, GACKT, KELUN, Lunkhead,ケツメイシ
Misc:pe&#039;zmoku--jazz band who did an ending called &quot;Gallop&quot; for Bleach the anime
Tokyo Jihen(awesome just like khatz said)
Rap/ Hip-Hop: Home Made Kazoku, Sakanaction
Almost all of the endings and openings for Bleach the anime are awesome.
PLEASE HELP MEEEE!!!&#062;.&#060;]]></description>

What&#039;s going on here? Is there some other band list that&#039;s in Japanese, which I unfortunately am not literate in (yet)?]]></description>
