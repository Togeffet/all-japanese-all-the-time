					<description><![CDATA[Judging by comments alone, I&#039;d say these question posts are both forgotten, yet probably the most important posts in all of AJATT-land. Sure, you can spread the good teachings of the methods you developed after the fact that you accomplished fluency... but it&#039;s very hard to specifically lay the tools to build a language-learning psychology. As Tony Robbins would say, all success is 80% psychology and 20% mechanics. You can have the best kung-fu-learning methods and have the best teachers, but if you don&#039;t ask the right/necessary/optimal questions, you&#039;ll never have the psychology worth mastery.
This also makes me wonder, and conclude: if the whole section of the personal development industry that focuses on affirmations, instead focused on questions, I would say we&#039;d have some personally developed hunks and hunkettes running around everywhere. Because nobody can really throw anything at you that you MUST develop within yourself. I&#039;d say questioning is a fatally unrealized tool, only common to success (see Tim Ferriss, Anthony Robbins. Tim Ferriss&#039; whole success is based on taking the question &quot;What&#039;s the worst that could happen?&quot; to its full extent, thus defining fears etc.).
I think it&#039;d be useful to meditate (in every meaning of the word) on these questions, and let it all flow in its own time. I certainly realize, from your success story, that these questions were essential. From the &quot;What if I were a Japanese baby?&quot;, to &quot;What if I was in a hostage situation that required my full ability in Japanese?&quot;. I&#039;m forgetting some, but I remember you mentioning them.Â ]]></description>
