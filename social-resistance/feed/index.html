					<description><![CDATA[Why does Ayn Rand keep on coming up in these comments?? I guess I remember seeing a poll with her as one of the most loved authors by &quot;non-critics.&quot; Which means normal people. I might have to give her a try, any thoughts on the Japanese translation? 

Anyway, this post definitely strikes a chord with me. I think especially for people living in Japan, like Lane&#039;s comment, it&#039;s easy to get sucked into the foreign crowd, which is really only a very small portion of society creating a micro-environment which effectively shields people from learning Japanese. (here I go quoting Khatzu again.) 

This post also reminds me of what Gary Wolf says about SRSing in the Wired article about Piotr Wozniak, the creator of Supermemo:

&quot;His advice was straightforward yet strangely terrible: You must clarify your goals, gain knowledge through spaced repetition, preserve health, work steadily, minimize stress, refuse interruption, and never resist sleep when tired. This should lead to radically improved intelligence and creativity. The only cost: turning your back on every convention of social life. It is a severe prescription.&quot;

http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak
(can someone teach me how to make links in these comments?)

I know it&#039;s been posted somewhere here, but it&#039;s a great read for anyone who missed it.]]></description>

Yea, it is funny how cultist the ideas are viewed (sadly), but it is more about updating learning a new language to the current day and age. We no longer have to use paper flash cards, one source of the spoken language (aka the teacher), special books written for language learners, a special non-native alphabet, special meal plans....oh wait sorry I drifted. :)
