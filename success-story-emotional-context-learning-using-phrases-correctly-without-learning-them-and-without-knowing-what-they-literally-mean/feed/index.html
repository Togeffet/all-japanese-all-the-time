					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had similar experiences! One time, early on in my immersioning, I yelled at my cat, saying „Äå„Åä„ÅÑ„ÄÅ„Å™„Éº„Å´„ÇÑ„Å£„Å¶„Çì„Å†„ÄÅ„ÅäÂâç„Äç, despite having not actively noticed hearing that before and having never learned „ÇÑ„Çã. I got so caught off guard by that that I went and looked it up and... sure enough. It was exactly what I wanted. Really cool that this happens, eh? :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[quote]I realized that humans aren‚Äôt actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with its surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply, and multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I found out later what „Äå‰ªïÊ•≠„Äç meant, but I actually used the phrase before I even knew what it meant, which I find very weird and cool. I knew the emotional content before I knew its specific, literal meaning.&quot;

Isn&#039;t this how we learn our main language?^_^

Also..

I actually started to go ALL jap, and no subs when I watch stuff now. I found that subs are 100% useless. All I did was spend time improving my ability to read &quot;English&quot; or my &quot;L1 language&quot;. Even when I do sit back and just try to watch.. the subs are still &quot;present&quot;, they still exist in front of you in the &quot;now&quot;.. so they became a distraction and I got rid of that... (of course subs are fine here and there w/ anime... but with TV shows, I go all raw..)

I now noticed what this guy has started to notice, emotion was latching onto words and I&#039;m already picking up words here and there easier. I even repeat phrases that carry emotion now, and in fact.... isn&#039;t language nothing but emotion? People have spent so much time in front of computers and txt msging, normal text can only go so far ya know.

So I now think (thanks to this article for the push), that the best and only efficient way to learn(once you get to a certain point), is by putting the emotion into that word.... That&#039;s the reason that word you&#039;re learning, means what it means, no? I also noticed that when I read, I can dimly hear the voice of some jap guy from a movie or something...
