					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking this week about asking you to start writing in Japanese. Your site is generally a waste of my time which could otherwise be spent reading something in Japanese. But it&#039;s really interesting! So if you were to do us the gratuity of giving us something really interesting to read in Japanese...well, I for one would be pretty gracious.]]></description>

&gt;a most vague idea estimate the time you took to do all those basic 500-1000 Japanese-English sentences?
Very vague estimate, but at 10-25 sentences per day...maybe 60 days or so? Yeah...that sounds about right.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Jeniko
You might check to see if you can get NHK World from your cable/satellite provider.  I got to watch it when I was back in the Washington DC area visiting family around Christmas.  (Both Comcast and Verizon FiOS had it on their standard digital lineups.)  They have a pretty good selection of news, documentaries, etc. like you might expect from a PBS station in the US.  The only catch is that half of it is either in English or dubbed in English.  It&#039;s very frustrating when you find a Japanese show only to have a booming English voice over top of it.  The shows which were originally produced in English do tend to have Japanese subs however.  Still, it&#039;s great for the half which is still in Japanese, and you can always turn it off when an English show comes on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with Max. As I said before, it would be very nice to read all these posts in kanji-kana version. My opinion is: if you(Khatz) wanted to write japanese versions of the existing posts I really would not mind seeing no more posts until you have finished the japanese ones.
Uh...Khatz, thanks for the reply about the last comment. An even (maybe) quicker question: could you in a most vague idea estimate the time you took to do all those basic 500-1000 Japanese-English sentences?]]></description>
