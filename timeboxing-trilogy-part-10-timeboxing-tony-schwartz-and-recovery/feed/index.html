					<description><![CDATA[Well IMO reading a book with or without a dictionary should just be fun time.  If you aren&#039;t having fun with it then either find a better book that you like, or switch to manga or another input source.  At least in my case I found that by buying books I would normally want to read in English, and making sure the material wasn&#039;t way over my level, I look forward to it.  

And then inputting the sentences that I&#039;ve mined is the &quot;work&quot; part but that only takes a few minutes so whatever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting post. I have to say I am excited to see a little more written about time boxing. 

One thing I would like to add, though, is it seems that this it would be slightly difficult to apply this to other forms of learning (such as reading with a dictionary or learning through an audio book) as with some activities a more intense time focus would be needed. Shorter time boxes would be less useful and longer sessions would be needed. Additionally, such activities might not need a break in the middle as they are more engaging than activities that are more prone to mental burnout, such as SRS.

It&#039;s fascinating to consider time boxing in relation to everything that can be built into doing it. I think you have written quite extensively on the subject so far, but I look forward to hearing about your next big development.

Good to see your back into form!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it can work together: ultra-short-term and long term change (activity and recovery).
It is true in economics as well - those cycles, there are short term -3-5 years, and long term - 60-70 years. And in sport as well: they train and recover every week (several/many times per week). And when they play the tournament / competition they stress even more for a longer period of time (including intense preparation). After that they take a rest (e.g. don&#039;t train at all for several days). Interesting, they don&#039;t train often a couple of days before the competition as well, to recover and give all 100% they are capable of.

So we can have ultra-short-term things but do them more often in an &quot;intensive week&quot; and less often in the &quot;recovery week&quot;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz,
Great stuff!
I was going slowly to build an understanding and system similar to this. But I was years behind before clearly formulating ideas like Mr. Schwarz presented it.
Renewal and energy flow. Such a great enhancement into my quality of life.
Now, I better set up the environment for good and effective recovery ;)
Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this khatz, it is really great information. I highly reccomend everyone follow the links khatzumoto-sempai so graciously left for us, specifically the Leader@google talks with Tony Schwartz. Yes it is English, and I almost passed on it for that reason.  But this is information so powerful, if you&#039;ll truly begin applying it immediately, it will not just make up for the time spent in English, it has the potential to transform your life. Schwartz is teaching us how to put in place a lifestyle that will allow our capacities for productivity to expand well beyond the range they would be stuck at if left alone. I&#039;m especially intrigued by the idea of building sustainable, highly specific rituals for modifying behavior. That&#039;s essentially what khatzumotto has inspired so many of us to do unconsciously, and it&#039;s one good reason ajatt is so effective. Even if you apply these techniques to only one small corner of your life (learning a second language), i think that you&#039;ll begin to benefit in other ways.

Just by making a few minute, tiny tweaks to my own personal study cycle based on what khatz wrote here and what i heard in the videos from schwartz, i&#039;ve been able to double the amount of srs cards, videos watched AND pages read today, and yet i feel more rested and less stressed than ever.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for this khatz, it is really great information. I highly reccomend everyone follow the links khatzumoto-sempai so graciously left for us, specifically the Leader@google talks with Tony Schwartz. Yes it is English, and I almost passed on it for that reason.  But this is information so powerful, if you&#8217;ll truly begin applying it immediately, it will not just make up for the time spent in English, it has the potential to transform your life. Schwartz is teaching us how to put in place a lifestyle that will allow our capacities for productivity to expand well beyond the range they would be stuck at if left alone. I&#8217;m especially intrigued by the idea of building sustainable, highly specific rituals for modifying behavior. That&#8217;s essentially what khatzumotto has inspired so many of us to do unconsciously, and it&#8217;s one good reason ajatt is so effective. Even if you apply these techniques to only one small corner of your life (learning a second language), i think that you&#8217;ll begin to benefit in other ways.</p>
