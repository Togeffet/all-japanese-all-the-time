					<description><![CDATA[I requested a clean start on SS.  Here&#039;s why:

1. I was in SS BB.  That doesn&#039;t teach you the jouyou kanji.  At all.  Zero.
2. I don&#039;t know the jouyou kanji.  I thought I did, which was why I signed up for BB.  But I don&#039;t.
3. That was preventing me from learning everything else.  My failure rate on SRS cards was 95+%.  In Anki, every card would be marked as a leech.  In Surusu, it would just show me tons of cards, both new and old, hoping I would eventually learn one.  I didn&#039;t.  I faithfully did reps for A YEAR.  I learned next to nothing.

So, I need to learn the jouyou kanji.  I&#039;m in BB, and that&#039;s the wrong program.  So how do I get Neutrino to teach me the jouyou kanji?  By switching to normal SS, not BB.  But if I just switch, it would keep my current progress; it would think I knew the jouyou kanji.

So, I need to do the jouyou kanji section of vanilla SS neutrino.  How do I do that?  Switch programs, and start over.

I just felt I had to defend my request a bit after that post.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is probably your best post this year, because it abides by the quality standards that your older posts in the older days used to go by. Also return of the section headers.

&quot;Imagine that you’re feeling road trippy, so you decide to drive from Utah to Texas. Or New York to LA. I dunno. Screw you. New York to LA. You’ve been going a coupla days, and you discover you’ve been going the wrong way. So you drive back to New York. Clean slate. Start again. Another couple days, you’re lost again. What do you do? Well, you have this slate-wiping habit, so even though you’re in what you think is Alabama, you go back to NY, because you’ve messed up. So you go back to New York. And start again. Are you seeing how inefficient this is?&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;On the practical plane, starting dirty reuses, re-purposes and recycles previous work, which saves time, effort and energy. [...] &#039;Old wine in new bottles&#039; is often used as an insult. But every creativity book I’ve read says that that’s exactly what creativity is: a new combination of old/existing ideas.&quot;

True dat. This is something I especially noticed while programming, although it applies to everything. I started out by copying someone else&#039;s code and learning how it works, then I copied my own code across projects, and now I copy it from old projects and improve it along the way. Saves a lot of time since you don&#039;t have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;, especially with GUI projects which can get convoluted.]]></description>
