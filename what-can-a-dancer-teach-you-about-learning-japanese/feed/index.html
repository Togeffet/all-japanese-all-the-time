					<description><![CDATA[Hard to believe this once poppin site was abandoned, but the goldmine of information on here is just... Awesome! Since 2009 I have been coming here, and whenever I need a shot in the arm for any language learning inspiration, this is STILL my go to! This site I spent a lot of time on back in the day. 

Its already been awhile since you last posted Khats, but if one day you decide to come back, I think all of us would love it. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was about to give up studying Japanese today after thinking about it for the past few months. I was wondering why I was still doing it if I basically had no reason to other than &quot;I&#039;ve gotten used to it.&quot; For some reason I figured I would come to this site, knowing it had been abandoned, just to wander the empty corridors of blog posts for some inspiration.

And what do I find? A brand spank&#039;n new post! Thanks Khatz!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! Thanks a lot for this post, Khatz! I&#039;m very happy to see that you&#039;re doing fine. I could cry but... :D
Personally I liked the point about solitude. It amuses me when I see people saying they would like to know Japanese but without abandoning their &quot;native&quot; life. Of course, you have to abandon your native life. Actually, not even abandon, just reduce it to the absolute minimum required for daily usage. Otherwise you risk not giving enough time for Japanese to sink in.
And oh, it&#039;s been 10 years(!) since the humble green beginnings of this blog! I never imagined myself reading a blog for 10 years! :D
But the content speaks for itself. My Japanese still sucks a lot for financial reasons but the love remains. The day I&#039;ll get it right is not too far away!
It&#039;s probably very difficult to add any more wisdom to this blog but if you will, if you can please keep posting.
On a sidenote, thanks a lot for introducing me to Gokusen and Gintama. Especially, Gintama! Can&#039;t leave without it anymore! :D]]></description>
