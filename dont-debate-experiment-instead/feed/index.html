Never ask if you&#8217;re &#8220;good at&#8221; Japanese. Just go learn a new word. Just move. Just turn on the (Japanese) TV. Just timebox. Just get things rolling.

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Because we know it doesn‚Äôt help. We know it‚Äôs a waste of time.

Like any good tool, if it isn&#039;t used, it&#039;s useless.  On the flip side, talking over various methods and outcomes can mean the difference between hammering a nail with, say, a hammer versus a socket wrench or, in the spirit of the words of the Khatzu himself, it can mean the difference between learning language by spending a few hours a week in boring classes or by having fun reading manga/listening to music.

A certain amount of discussion is helpful in determining which is a more appropriate method to pursue, but in the context of the time spent actually doing something would constitute a negligibly small percentage of the total.

I think the important difference is to realize that the tool is useless if it isn&#039;t used.  So if we&#039;re talking about hammering with a hammer versus a socket wrench, if we never actually spend time driving the nail, we might as well be using shoestrings or spaghetti.  That doesn&#039;t change the fact that the hammer is the most appropriate.

Perhaps what Khatzu is saying is that, if we learn about the hammer while using the socket wrench, we can &quot;change horses midstream&quot;, but at no point should we not be actively hammering.

To that extent, I would agree and concede that the point of my post is moot.  : )]]></description>
