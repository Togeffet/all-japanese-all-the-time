					<description><![CDATA[Holy crap this is awesome!

Can there be a list of &quot;full&quot; members with their blogs so we can all live vicariously though them? 

Or possibly even a reality TV show, or at least video blogging? 

Seriously what an awesome idea. Much love to all the haters, except I learned Japanese in about 595 days and I totally bugged Khatz the whole time wishing there was something like this. This is a completely logical progression from the beginning to the QRG to plus and now this. I am personally really excited for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hear you, man. There seems to be this mentality that a person can&#039;t make money by *gasp* doing something they love. It&#039;s like they think it&#039;s somehow immoral and all righteous, &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; people work shitty office jobs.

I&#039;m not sure if its exclusively an American attitude, but it does seem like there&#039;s a sort of hostility towards people that don&#039;t work the typical 9 to 5 grind. I remember when I worked at a grocery store, a co-worker of mine said that he didn&#039;t feel sorry for rich celebrities if they got into horrible accidents or killed. I&#039;m beginning to think it stems from the whole &quot;average Joe&quot; mentality that is seen as all right over here, but I digress.

Yeah, just had to rant about that. It&#039;s a gigantic pet peeve of mine because I don&#039;t want to be another office stooge.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If there is a waiting list, I&#039;d love to be on it, or know when its going to open before hand. If this guy says that he&#039;ll make me fluent if i do what he says for 85 weeks, well I&#039;m game!

					<description><![CDATA[aside from all of the above, what&#039;s actually wrong with making money doing what you enjoy anyway?  I just dunno what (a small subset of) people are getting all upons for.  What&#039;s the point?

As someone has already said the free site and all the advice that&#039;s ever been on it is still there...  even if Khatz DID take it down, that&#039;s his right.  I don&#039;t see it happening, but if it did then that&#039;s the way the cookie crumbles, hey.  The fact this is so in-demand makes it pretty obvious that even with all the awesome info on AJATT, people are still having trouble finding the way, and more just don&#039;t even try (I&#039;m sure it&#039;s something like 90% of people that read self-help/go to seminars never act on the advice or implement it into their lives in anyway... 90% is probably a bit conservative).

This site is still about precisely the same stuff as it was a few weeks ago... and a few years ago.  Chill out dude :)

And yeah reading the other comments... &#039;easy money&#039;... well I&#039;ve got a feeling Khatz has had a good deal of fun putting this together, but man who DOESN&#039;T want to get paid for what they enjoy doing.  If this thing actually works - it&#039;s one heck of a claim - it&#039;ll really be amazing and should (I dunno if it WILL, but it should) have huge implications for language learning.  If it DOESN&#039;T work, the paying customers get a full refund at the end.

So I mean... seriously, I don&#039;t see what the beef is here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t really help now since it&#039;s sold out (this is more for if there ends up being another round), but maybe try talking to your parents about paying for this now, and then use credit by examination or placement tests to skip foreign language classes in college later?  As e_dub_kendo pointed out below, a year and a half of college classes is way more than this, and you&#039;d learn way less too.

If your parents aren&#039;t into that, like you said, the free area of the blog is great, so you&#039;ll definitely reach Japanese fluency one way or another :). Just remember to have fun with Japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz makes a lot of noise about not liking people, not being nice, etc. But if the man didn&#039;t honestly care about helping people achieve fluency in Japanese, he&#039;d never have put so many YEARS of his life into building up this site and the products it offers. I&#039;ve tried my hand at simply blogging. Despite having a fairly time-rich life, putting together original and interesting content on a regular basis proved to be impossible for me. And that&#039;s coming from someone who LOVES to see his own words and enjoys writing. So I know how much effort he&#039;s put into this site. As other people have pointed out, both in this post and in the other, though it perhaps seems like a lot of money to join Silverspoons, when you break it down, it&#039;s not much at all. Perhaps, eventually, as he gathers more students and automates his process, it will become lucrative, but at least the initial waves of SilverSpooners are paying a relatively small amount for a relatively high investment of energy and time. I imagine that the money Khatz makes from this and other projects is just enough to allow him to continue to invest such high proportions of his time and energy into DOING SOMETHING HE CARES ABOUT. As much as it would be nice if just giving everything away for free and living on donations paid enough of the bills to make it possible to continue an endeavor like this indefinitely, in the real world it just doesn&#039;t work that way. 

As far as Khatz changing tactics, yes, for years he&#039;s been saying, &quot;You don&#039;t need me to hold your hand. You don&#039;t need me to make the day-to-day decisions for you.&quot; Hell, even recently, when he posted a response to the question &quot;What was a day in the life of Khatz like?&quot; And basically he said, &quot;it doesn&#039;t matter what I did. Just look at adding more Japanese to your own life.&quot; and people were all getting their feelings hurt and stuff, and begging for a &quot;serious&quot; answer to the question. So, I think Khatz has simply embraced the fact that some people don&#039;t want or might even find it impossible to, do this without more direction and encouragement. Sure, there are plenty of us self-starters out there (although in my first few weeks of ajatt, i probably emailed khatz 20 times), who CAN and WILL do this deal on our own, there are a lot of people who will benefit from more guidance. 

Can he provide that kind of guidance for free? No, as I spoke about above, it&#039;s unrealistic to think that would even be possible unless he was independently wealthy or something, and to the best of my knowledge that he is not. As others have pointed out in the original post, a course at your local community college, a boring course where you&#039;d probably learn the kana, a handful of words, and a bunch of useless grammar, such a course would cost you MULTIPLE TIMES what SilverSpooners are paying Khatz for this new service. The biggest difference, though, Khatz has GUARANTEED you fluency. I can guarantee you just as assuredly that after two semesters of college Japanese you will NOT be fluent. Not even close. I took 3 years of Japanese at uni and I learned more in two months of AJATT than during all that time. 

The difference is, most of you complainers and haters have probably never paid a tuition bill out-of-pocket in your life. You got fin aid, or student loans, or your parents paid for it, so the cost of those college courses doesn&#039;t seem real to you. Meanwhile, this requires &quot;real&quot; money coming out of your own pocket. 

Truth-be-told, I don&#039;t have the money for AJATT SS. And honestly, I doubt it&#039;s for me anyways. I like to do things my own way far too much. But for those who can both afford it and benefit from it, I certainly bear no grudge. And I commend Khatz for continuing to pursue something he&#039;s obviously passionate about. I hope the day comes when he never has to take a job or work assignment he doesnt personally want to take again, and that he can make a good living just from doing ajatt stuff, if that&#039;s what he chooses.

Good luck khatz and がんばって SilverSpooners.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khatz makes a lot of noise about not liking people, not being nice, etc. But if the man didn&#8217;t honestly care about helping people achieve fluency in Japanese, he&#8217;d never have put so many YEARS of his life into building up this site and the products it offers. I&#8217;ve tried my hand at simply blogging. Despite having a fairly time-rich life, putting together original and interesting content on a regular basis proved to be impossible for me. And that&#8217;s coming from someone who LOVES to see his own words and enjoys writing. So I know how much effort he&#8217;s put into this site. As other people have pointed out, both in this post and in the other, though it perhaps seems like a lot of money to join Silverspoons, when you break it down, it&#8217;s not much at all. Perhaps, eventually, as he gathers more students and automates his process, it will become lucrative, but at least the initial waves of SilverSpooners are paying a relatively small amount for a relatively high investment of energy and time. I imagine that the money Khatz makes from this and other projects is just enough to allow him to continue to invest such high proportions of his time and energy into DOING SOMETHING HE CARES ABOUT. As much as it would be nice if just giving everything away for free and living on donations paid enough of the bills to make it possible to continue an endeavor like this indefinitely, in the real world it just doesn&#8217;t work that way. </p>
<p>As far as Khatz changing tactics, yes, for years he&#8217;s been saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t need me to hold your hand. You don&#8217;t need me to make the day-to-day decisions for you.&#8221; Hell, even recently, when he posted a response to the question &#8220;What was a day in the life of Khatz like?&#8221; And basically he said, &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter what I did. Just look at adding more Japanese to your own life.&#8221; and people were all getting their feelings hurt and stuff, and begging for a &#8220;serious&#8221; answer to the question. So, I think Khatz has simply embraced the fact that some people don&#8217;t want or might even find it impossible to, do this without more direction and encouragement. Sure, there are plenty of us self-starters out there (although in my first few weeks of ajatt, i probably emailed khatz 20 times), who CAN and WILL do this deal on our own, there are a lot of people who will benefit from more guidance. </p>
<p>Can he provide that kind of guidance for free? No, as I spoke about above, it&#8217;s unrealistic to think that would even be possible unless he was independently wealthy or something, and to the best of my knowledge that he is not. As others have pointed out in the original post, a course at your local community college, a boring course where you&#8217;d probably learn the kana, a handful of words, and a bunch of useless grammar, such a course would cost you MULTIPLE TIMES what SilverSpooners are paying Khatz for this new service. The biggest difference, though, Khatz has GUARANTEED you fluency. I can guarantee you just as assuredly that after two semesters of college Japanese you will NOT be fluent. Not even close. I took 3 years of Japanese at uni and I learned more in two months of AJATT than during all that time. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you think $1 per day is &quot;easy money&quot; for what would be at least 30 mins work then you probably haven&#039;t ever worked full time in your life.

There&#039;s not a lot Khatz can really add to regular AJATT- it&#039;s &quot;done&quot;. Yet despite that he still provides motivational updates and little nuggets of information.

SS is an extra service you can choose to participate in or not at your leisure. And yes, it is nice for Khatz to be able to get something back for the work he&#039;s done. But it&#039;s hardly &quot;easy&quot; money. It&#039;s a service at a quite reasonable cost- easily comparable to a text book or course.]]></description>
