					<description><![CDATA[Just thought I&#039;d say I finished RTK1 using this method today. I plan to move onto RTK 3 and the supplemental added kanji for a total of 3030 kanji. I&#039;m not sure if this method is better than the original one last I did it but I am sure of one thing. It made it a lot easier. I didn&#039;t feel as stressed this time and I&#039;m confident that there will never be a repeat of forgetting and neglecting my kanji deck again. So just wanted to say thanks for showing me this method.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t a fan of heisig so I began doing this, but I have a recommendation for anyone who wants to use this method successfully. Every time you draw a kanji, do the following:
0. Recognize the meaning of the kanji (Don&#039;t even write it if you don&#039;t know the meaning)
1. Look at the kanji on the card for about 10 seconds and try to remember how it looks
2. Try writing it after looking away without looking back at the card
3. Compare your writing of the kanji to the card and make note of what is wrong
4. Write the kanji again while looking at the card
5. Write the kanji a third time from memory while repeating the keyword in your head over and over. If you write it wrong, go back to step 3. 

So you only write it 3 times this method, but it gets in your head a lot better. First of all you&#039;re focused on figuring out how to write it from step 1, and if you make a mistake on the first writing and notice it right away it is more likely to stick in your head as a reminder if how the kanji is written. I have no been doing this long but if people want to try it and tell me how it works for them, I&#039;d be interested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good question I&#039;ve been wondering myself, however, I&#039;d say it is worth it to have your own Lazy Kanji RTK deck. The reason why is that you learn stroke order, where primitives/radicals are likely to show up in new kanji and exactly what they&#039;ll look like and how to write them, and you&#039;ll also have a firmer image of the kanji in your mind when you go to write them or when you look at them and are trying to differentiate between similar kanji.

However, if you think it&#039;s worth it to just jump straight into MCDs, it might be worth trying for 2-3 months to see the results. As long as you&#039;re not in a hurry, experimenting is lovely. If MCDs first with no RTK works better, you&#039;ll save yourself and lots of others&#039; time. Good luck, either way =) ]]></description>

The meaning are so off the mark sometimes, only (maybe) 5% of kanji are used alone and, well, when you learn a new word (mcd), you learn each one of the kanji anyway so... Is there really any purpose to learn kanji alone in another deck ? Is it just a waste of time ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am confused, do you put the kanji then guess what the meaning is when creating cards? Or do you put the kanji then look up the definition in a dictionary, then paste it in.  I know about 100 kanji and I cannot read a lot, so the the definitions in the dictionary might be a problem. So is this for beginners or for people who are already pretty far in just looking to increase their knowledge?]]></description>
