					<description><![CDATA[As you may have heard, Livemocha is no longer in business and that link no longer works. 
Also, site, https://www.lingq.com/, is an web and mobile language learning tool for learning languages in context. This is a good analog of Livemocha!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have recently developed a new site for doing language exchange specifically with Japanese people, Oh My Japan:
https://ohmyjapan.com

Unlike My Language Exchange, which was mentioned in the original post, my site allows free members to contact up to two new people per week for free as well as receive unlimited messages for free.  I&#039;m not in this to make money; although I don&#039;t need to practice my own Japanese as much anymore (I&#039;m a translator living in Japan), I wanted to give people the same opportunities I had to talk to lots of Japanese people so they can improve their own language skills as they help others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[www.lang-8.com isn&#039;t bad either.  Of course it&#039;s all in who you meet and use basic social networking common sense (like don&#039;t &quot;friend&quot; someone just because they ask, check out a post or two before you do).  I get trolls who make random comments about US politics, but my two best buddies are other 40-somethings who just want to get the kids to school and learn some Japanese along the way.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe no one has mentioned livemocha.com. 

It&#039;s basically Rosetta Stone and Facebook merged into one entity. People from all over the world create profiles with a picture, their info, and the languages they speak and what level, etc. You can add friends and IM each other in whatever language you want while otherwise doing Rosetta Stone-like exercises with the site&#039;s built-in software. 
The learning exercises also include speaking and writing parts; of which upon completing, you send your submissions to native speakers of that respective language so they can grade it and tell you how much you suck thanks to high school courses/how awesome you are thanks to following the methods from AJATT. 

Oh, and it&#039;s FREE!!!]]></description>

http://lang-8.com/

It&#039;s a website where you input sentences in your target language, and a native speaker comes along and corrects any mistakes you made in the sentence, you can correct other people&#039;s English too. Very useful if you&#039;re about to input sentences into your SRS IMO.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I also visit SharedTalk.com every so often, it&#039;s a great place to meet other eager language learners. If you&#039;re a native English speaker then you&#039;ll be quite popular there, I usually get too many chat requests to cope with, usually from Koreans I might add.

I&#039;d also like to take this post to give my first hello to Khatzumoto (and to all those who frequent his blog), what an inspirational site you&#039;ve got going here. After learning Japanese (at school + university) for over 10 years, finally I&#039;ve come across some practical and effective study methods. To be honest I was fed up with attending my Japanese classes, week after week after month after year, not getting anywhere fast -- now I&#039;m learning faster than ever and I have you to thank.

This site is awesome, keep up the good work!

					<description><![CDATA[I signed up there, but I didn&#039;t really want to pay. A good free one I found was SharedTalk. It&#039;s free, you can text and voice chat and even use email on there :3 Everyone is eager to learn languages and there are tons of Japanese people of a wide range of ages wanting to &quot;learn&quot; English in exchange for &quot;teaching&quot; Japanese. My suggestion is that you get good enough at Japanese to where you can have a text chat (no romaji and know enough vocabulary) otherwise it isn&#039;t really worth the time fumbling around and having them &quot;teach&quot; you what to say. I&#039;m not good enough to chat in Japanese yet, but by helping them with English, I&#039;m making friends that can chat with me in Japanese when I&#039;m ready. :3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Since taking up Japanese I’ve looked for Japanese coworkers at every job I’ve had, sometimes searching for random Japanese names in employee directories or casually following Asian people back to their cubes to read their nameplates.&quot;

This admission really did make me laugh - I mean, what a stalker hangout this website is :-)

So, here&#039;s a suggestion if anyone happens to be in London,and the legal restraining orders that Japanese co-workers/acquaintances have obtained against you are limiting the possibilities of speaking Japanese:

The prime Japanese-speaking-opportunity seeking stalker hangout in London has to be the Japan Centre in Picadilly - it&#039;s chock full Japanese people, and you can even stalk the staff in Japanese if you want. Not that I really know, of course, eeerr..., I just happen to (frequently) pop in there to eeerr... gaze at the wonderful products on display....

And it even has a message board as well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you can find someone to help you get invited to (www.mixi.jp), it&#039;s basically a networking site like myspace, but it is all japanese. You can just join groups for languae exchange on there and people will often ask you talk to talk with them or exchange emails or messages.
There are some weirdos out there, but most everyone who contacted me was just as eager to help with japanese as they were to learn english.

If you need an invite, this guy offers it to anyone for free:

http://gaijinwomen.com/be-invited-to-mixi/

Plus, if you&#039;re kind of a beginner with Japanese, he can help you set up an account. But, I wouldn&#039;t suggest Mixi for a complete beginner, seeing as the whole website is in Japanese.

I hope that helps some people.]]></description>
