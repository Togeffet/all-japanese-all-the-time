					<description><![CDATA[I thought I&#039;d try out timeboxing again after reading this post, and then I realized that timeboxing has become so much a part of my daily life that I forgot that already use it. Constantly.

I cannot imagine my life before SRS or timeboxing.¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should probably try timeboxing at some point... time boxing settings are built into Anki, and I presume into Surusu. It can make the time use more efficient because you know you&#039;re against the clock and focus, even if you don&#039;t have the &#039;starting&#039; problem. For me, for kanji, though, it really didn&#039;t help... once I start doing my kanji reviews I just get into the groove and keep going until they are done, sometimes with a break halfway if I have a lot of reps that day. For vocabulary reviews though, timeboxing really helps with the &#039;getting started&#039; thing. 

 Also for -adding- stuff to my decks, easily the most tedious task in studying Japanese which is why people love premade decks, but I really want to review -specific- vocabulary for re-reading / re-watching some things. No built in tool for that, though, need to set a timer for that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is timeboxing really necessary ¬†if you&#039;re still learning kanji? I&#039;ve been doing RTK(anji) for like three days and am only on the 114th one...I do SRS reps about an hour a day, and spend two hours on the book. I feel like I could do more, but I try not to push myself too hard (or hard at all, actually. I don&#039;t like pushin&#039; muhself to do anything). I feel like I&#039;m getting along okay, with a 91% (not too great, but whatever) retention rate...would timeboxing help me?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I prefer timeboxing with sentences. I only have like 15 Kanji reps per day, so I just do them in one go, but sentences, I set a question limit of 25, then take a 5 minute break, then repeat. I guess you could call it Question boxing :P I just prefer it more.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for reminding me that I need to give timeboxing another chance.
I used timeboxing at some point and it does work REALLY well.

					<description><![CDATA[Sometimes I time box with music to add a little spice to it.¬† For instance, I&#039;ll find a song I like that&#039;s around five minutes, or whatever time, and then try to finish or do as much of my task as possible before the song is over.¬† And if I&#039;m doing a repetitive task, I&#039;ll put the song on repeat until I get sick of it.
¬†
And for me, time boxing doesn&#039;t really help me with the &quot;showing up&quot; part.¬† It does decrease the amount of time I spend on things, though, because it helps me focus on getting more done in a smaller time window.¬† I mean box.]]></description>
