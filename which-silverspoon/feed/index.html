					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Sounds great, but how much should I pay for that fantastic Neutrino? Does it depend of languages? 
Some of you , waiting our time to come, did discover how much Khatz is asking for?

Merci!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There are a few things on this site a bit too cryptic for me, one is this. I waited till today to sign up for Neutrino SinoSpoon, but now there is a password box that blocks my entrance. I signed up for some waiting list, but nothing is explained... Is it that only the people who are at the top of the list (this round at least) get an email with the password? Then they gain access to this site where they can buy SinoSpoon...? Can anybody help explain to me how this works?

我不清楚.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How much of a time commitment is Vanilla SilverSpoon? 

I want to learn, but my schedule is pretty tight right now so I want to know if I can fit it in without going down to 5 hours of sleep.

Is it 1 hour a day? 2 hours? variable?

Thanks in advance.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This isn’t directly - or even indirectly - related to the post, but anyway, I’m just leaving a comment to say good on you for finally putting a link to Kanji Damage on AJATT. I’ve been a huge fan of KD for several years, as it basically taught me Japanese from scratch, and I think that it fits right in with the AJATT philosophy (IMHO, I also think it’s better than Heisig, although some may disagree…).]]></description>
