					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it&#039;s an unpopular opinion, but I agree (the need for more of an explanation than faith, that is.)
 
To embark on a journey with nearly no visible returns for months, you have to deal with a lot of self doubt. Sometimes, I wonder if the cracks in my immersion are cutting my progress to a tenth of what it could be; sometimes, I wonder if I&#039;m actually engaged enough in my Japanese audio to actually be learning; Of course, I&#039;m always I&#039;m wondering if I&#039;m, &quot;doing this right.&quot;
 
Indeed, &quot;just use the method&quot; is sound advice, but perhaps a little more description would be handy.
 
It would seem that saying, &quot;Step 1: build an immersion environment&quot; to 藤原健二 would be silly, seeing how s/he&#039;s already living in Japan, but I think it&#039;s still valid with a little twist: make sure you don&#039;t make an *English* environment while being immersed in Japan!
 
After that, start learning the Kanji. Also, just turn on your TV - as Khatz suggested - and just leave it on. Everyday, let yourself be graced with the beautiful Kanji and sounds of the language.
 
And as for the self doubt, well, there is nothing that will remedy that. But, keep in mind that thousands of people - just like you and me - have seriously doubted the entire Japanese thing and thought they&#039;d never get there. But, they did. Just as long as you know more today than you did yesterday, you&#039;ll get there, trust me (:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The low rating of your post proves my point. I&#039;m right, and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it. I wasn&#039;t being rude or anything. I&#039;m just stating the obvious. I do have a native-like accent in English, even if I&#039;ve never lived in the US. 
I also used to sound native in Italian—native enough for my teacher to say &quot;your grandparents are from Italy, right?&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[&#060;q&#062;Just use the method on this website and you’ll become fluent. That’s how awesome AJATT is.&#060;/q&#062;
 I think the discussion warrants a little more explanation than faith in a method. I do follow the tenets of the website but find the comment a bit rude.
Have you learned a language to fluency with a native level accent? ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Several people mentioned that you could just as easily do this anywhere else in the world, and they&#039;re absolutely right, though perhaps people IN Japan need to hear it even more because they may automatically assume that they don&#039;t need to do this since they&#039;re already in the country and unless they speak the language already (and they wouldn&#039;t be reading this if they did, now would they?) then they very well DO need to do it.

Just expose yourself to the language as much as possible in as many different ways as you can, it&#039;s really that simple.

Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>

A Japanese TV could be replaced by a screen with anime/drama/J-TV (And YOU get to choose the programs here, which equals premium TV with the best programs :D). As for the Shonen pages on the fridge... everyone has a printer, and there are tons of internet pages with tons of content, maybe with some creativity you could create yourself something similar to look at. Concerning the dubbed Hollywood movie, I believe there could be ways around it. Of course, all this requires effort, and doesn&#039;t replace the original environment..
