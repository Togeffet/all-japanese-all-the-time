					<description><![CDATA[Well I&#039;m not sure it should be about forgiveness. I&#039;m thinking if you want to learn the language, if you like the language, if you want to learn a Kanji, you will learn a Kanji. So yes you may be satisfied after learning one Kanji, but if you enjoyed the experience you would still learn another one, but only because you would enjoy it, not because you wouldn&#039;t be able to forgive yourself otherwise. Basically the more easily something can satisfy you by giving you a sense of achievement of something you love, the more addictive it should be, and the more you should want to do it. I understand what you mean though. Like if you feel accomplished then you might feel like slacking, if the accomplishment is of something you love, and it&#039;s easy I would think it would urge you to do more.]]></description>
