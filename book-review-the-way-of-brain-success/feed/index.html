					<description><![CDATA[I am Jewish. I was brought up in a semi-secular Jewish home. The TV was rarely on; we all read books. I used my allowance to get a library card for a public library with a larger collection than there was in my own town when I turned 14.

I was born in NYC. Until I was 9 I had never had any but cursory contact with non-Jews. I really knew next to nothing about their thoughts or culture. Then we moved to NJ and things totally changed. Very few Jews; lots of non-Jews. I was beaten up regularly for having killed Jesus, etc. etc. Never told anyone since I figured, Why bother;  my parents will just freak out.

I still have a broken tooth from one of those interfaith meetings. It is my reminder that I have to learn to take care of myself. I ( we) can never depend on others.

At age 20 I went to Israel where I studied Babylonian Talmud. That is the number one contribution of the Jews to civilization, IMHO. It teaches you how to think. It is the most amazing self-development key that I have ever encountered.

There are English translations but you really have to study it in Hebrew and Aramaic ( the language of the Jews when they were expelled from Israel by the Romans in 70AD). There are many, many brilliant commentaries. The whole Talmud is basically questions, answers, questions, answers by the brightest minds of the Jewish world over many centuries up until the present.

That is what the raisins and honey are all about. Not to study the Bible; to study the Talmud.

The Talmud is where all the mental and intellectual prowess of Jews derives from.

And, thanks for this wonderful blog!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To add a little more, I think constant travel (if you have a decent bed, ample food, and occasional friends or acquaintances) is the best thing for a mind. You are thrown back on your thoughts, your journal, and what you can recall of things elsewhere, whether they be in books or in the real world. That constant movement makes the most meaningful connection between reading and life. I find it more important to remember that for one&#039;s own sake than for anything else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found the point about Jewish literacy compelling, but I have a caveat to add about the young-students-learning-scripture-for-rewards part of the argument. This happens in protestant churches across the U.S. today, and that in no way instills a tendency to apply that literacy towards any subjects beyond the Bible. So there has to be more than the encouragement of learning of one specific kind, for a culture to embrace openness of thought. In most cases in most places, indolence wins.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Incidentally, I&#039;ve always found some of the similarities between the Jews and the Chinese interesting. 

1) Both cultures traditionally placed an enormous amount of emphasis on learning, to the point that some Jews would often devote practically their entire lives to study of the Talmud, just as many young Chinese would devote their entire lives to study of the Confucian classics and passing the Imperial examination. 

2) Both have a pretty massively widespread diaspora. You can find Jews and Chinese in the most absurdly diverse places. 

3) Both cultures are really, really old. Really old. And proud of it.

4) Deserved or undeserved, both have a reputation for clannishness. There&#039;s us, and there&#039;s them. 

5) Rather more unfortunately, they both seem to have the same negative stereotypes. Stingy money-grubbers, cheaters, only care about themselves, come in and take all the money from the poor, persecuted majority.  

6) Sort of incidental similarity, but both had a rather horrific experience living under Axis occupation in World War II. 

Is it just me? Maybe. In any case, a rather large difference, of course, is the Jews being outnumbered by Han Chinese 100 to 1.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re back in Japan, and now I&#039;m back in Taiwan. Ach! Oy vey iz mir! 

Bleh. At some point in the future you&#039;ll either be back in Taiwan or I&#039;ll be in Japan. In either case, all will be made right. Hope you enjoyed your trip to this fair and happy land of motor scooters and betel nut chewers.

And as a history student, particularly a World War II buff, I must protest against the insinuation that Japan was free from anti-semitism in the bad old days of the &#039;30s and &#039;40s. There&#039;s an interesting book called War Without Mercy which offers a comparative examination of Western Allied and Japanese views and propaganda depictions of one another. Due to the alliance with Germany, you could find more and more anti-semitism filtering into Japanese propaganda as time went by, with Britain and the United States depicted more and more often in the typical Nazi propaganda style of &#039;international finance Jewry.&#039; 

The main difference, of course, was that few Japanese really had their hearts in it. It&#039;s hard to work up a burning, fiery passion of hatred of an ethnic group you have hardly the slightest history of interaction with. The Jews of the Shanghai Ghetto had more and more restrictions placed on them, but despite pressure from the Nazis the Japanese never handed them over to be shipped to Auschwitz.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks very much for your kind words about my book. BTW, I think the 猶太 characters are more common in Chinese (maybe your Taiwan influence). I definitely wanted to stick with katakana to avoid the somewhat racist &quot;dog&quot; associations in the characters. And there are a few illustrations in the book, though they are sparsely distributed and for the most part PowerPoint-ish. But thanks, 本当に!

Based on the discussion of education in this book, my wife and I were asked to write another, ユダヤ人が語った親バカ教育のレシピ (Index Communications 2006). This includes several interviews we did with a Nobel laureate, a MacArthur Pirze winner, and other prominent people about how they were brought up. We didn&#039;t all watch TV while reading, but there are many other similarites across the board, despite wide disparities in income, domestic situation, etc. The Korean translation of 親バカ is due to appear in a couple of weeks; the translation of ユダヤ人の頭のなか appeared there last year, though with a title, cover and some other modifications I did not approve of. 

Unfortunately, it&#039;s typical of Asian publishers to sensationalize books about Jews without the authors&#039; knowledge. In the case of the first Korean book, it was done AFTER a Korean friend of mine had already reviewed and approved the manuscript. The reason is greed, rather than racial animus; by appealing more to the audience&#039;s expectations (Jews = secrets of getting rich, in this case), they figure it will sell more. The publisher even expected I&#039;d be cool with that, because of potentially more royalties. Something similar is at work in the unbalanced coverage of Japan in US media -- US editors won&#039;t accept stories unless they&#039;re about some wacky fad or the Japanese economy going down the toilet (though stories about knife-wielding nuts in Akihabara do break through). I was lucky that my Japanese publisher was more on the level (though I&#039;d have definitely sued if they hadn&#039;t been).

I agree with what you say about literacy, and am both admiring and envious -- I&#039;ve been living in Tokyo for 2 years now and am far, far from  it. Thanks again.]]></description>

Reading is such a great way to be able to choose the material you see in a  foreign language. You can take your own pace and not have to rely on others to speak about the cool stuff you are interested in.

Otherwise this post was far too intellectual for me.]]></description>

<p>Reading is such a great way to be able to choose the material you see in a  foreign language. You can take your own pace and not have to rely on others to speak about the cool stuff you are interested in.</p>
<p>Otherwise this post was far too intellectual for me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, I&#039;d be great to get an update on your trip to Taiwan and your Chinese progress...Sorry to bring it up, I know its probably annoying hearing so many people wanting to know how your progress is going before you&#039;ve even completed the task...But, I think it&#039;d be interesting to hear if you discovered anything about your Chinese ability while in Taiwan(whether it be weakness&#039;s and/or strengths in your listening/speaking ability)!

Great post as always!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just wrote about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://yuehan.org/nsm/2009/02/tilfc-dealing-with-less-than-ideal-situations/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chinese ability to just put their heads down and deal with stuff going wrong&lt;/a&gt;, and I think the stereotypical (but reasonably widespread and accurate) view of Jewish success is similar. Few people have gotten the short end of the stick more consistently and made more out of it. Nurture is, as you mention, a lot more important than nature here.

I like that you&#039;re emphasizing reading here, too. Sometimes I think people get stuck up on SRS and sentencing (trees) without paying much attention to just reading like mad (forest). I&#039;ve never met an intelligent person (in any language) that wasn&#039;t a reader of some sort. If you aspire to be an intelligent person in another language (as I hope that most learners do), there&#039;s no reason to believe that it would be any different.]]></description>
