					<description><![CDATA[Hello, 

A bit late to the party but I wanted to say this post was great for a couple reasons. You&#039;re right, people are inclined to binge and purge even when there&#039;s no need to. It&#039;s harmful to oneself and only hinders one progress. Basically it&#039;s more effective to just find a gentle middle ground. 

Also your comment about white supremacy is totally true too. People like that (any supremacists) understand how to solve problems with division and violence. This they are unhappy. 

Now where can I sign up to your cult/newsletter? :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To answer you question about planes being off-course (like most things) it&#039;s a little more complicated, but essentially correct.  Truth is that whatever your destination the shortest distance there is a straight line, right?  Well, you can&#039;t always make that straight line, despite going &#039;as the crow flies&#039; because of two factors: wind, and other planes. Wind is just there, in fact it&#039;s more there up in the blue because in general it&#039;s stronger.  If it&#039;s a gusty day on the ground at 15 knots, it&#039;s probably 50 knots 5000&#039; up.  It&#039;s usually at least 50 knots up where we commonly fly in the 20 to 30 thousand foot region, but I&#039;ve seen winds as high as 150 knots in the gulf stream.  So you need to correct for that wind, and the most common way to do that is to &#039;crab&#039; into it.  If the wind is pushing me 10 NM south for every 100 miles West I go, then what I do is point 10 NM North of the spot I want to go in 100 miles.  That way even though the wind pushed me 10 South, I end up where I wanted because otherwise I would&#039;ve been 10 too far north.  Hopefully that makes sense; I&#039;d draw you a picture if I could.

The second factor (other planes) is really Air Traffic Control (ATC) who is always telling me where to go and what to do with my jet.  They do this so that they can manage all these planes that would otherwise fly any which way they wanted with no regard for any other plane in the sky.  &quot;See and Avoid&quot; is the phrase used when you don&#039;t want to bother with ATC, and is pretty much exactly what it sounds like.  It&#039;s not so tough when you&#039;re in a small single engine Cessna at low altitude where your only worries are other slow Cessnas (and the occasional military jet).  But if you&#039;re flying an airliner at 33 thousand feet traveling 500 knots true you may not have time to both &#039;see and avoid.&#039;  Plus jerking a jumbo jet around would upset the majority of the travelers inside.

So for the short version of the long answer to your short question: Yeah, we&#039;re not following the straight line, but no, we&#039;re never &#039;off course&#039;... Unless we&#039;re lost.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[こんばんは。

It&#039;s my first post here, so let me start by saying:  Khatz, you changed how I approach life.  Major props to you.

Anyway, on to my point:

I&#039;m currently in the midst of RTK (628/2042).  I&#039;ve been keeping up with my reviews the entire time, but I&#039;ve had a very difficult time adding new kanji with any sort of consistency.  Generally speaking, I have to force myself to do it, either out of obligation or because リトルバスターズ is showing me how very illiterate I am.  Binging and purging.

I know it&#039;s not a race, but 10 kanji a day is unacceptable for having basically nothing to do (part-time job one day a week and no school = free time!)  In fact, adding kanji--or NOT adding kanji--was leaving such a bad taste I would drop immersion to get away from it.

SO, (I think) I&#039;ve found a solution.  Anki (my SRS of choice) has an option to limit how many new cards you see per day.  I decided to set that relatively low (20).  Now, when I have a kanji-binge session, I build up a massive log of cards that then get introduced at a constant pace.  Rather than learning 50 kanji in one day and then not doing anything new for a week, I enter a bunch at once and have them introduced over the following days.  Interestingly, this has made me more eager to add new cards; I enjoy seeing the card numbers go up without having a boatload of first-time reps to go with it.

Of course, this isn&#039;t optimal, but I figure it&#039;s better to work with flaws rather than fight them.  (Also, my solution is rather obvious, but if it took me two months to figure it out maybe someone else might find it useful?)]]></description>

it has all the kanji but the readings are in romaji. But it does have a translation for each sentence. I wasn&#039;t thinking of SRSing this things but seeing how these are short and concise. It works out well!]]></description>

So...Is the Shelly quote based on Frisky Dingo? I really like that part and was just curious if you&#039;ve watched it at all.

Great post. ^_^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is my $0.02. I stopped using Supermemo twice, and both instances were within two weeks or so. Since then I have never missed a day in 3+ years. Even on some days where I have more than 600 cards (Only happened a few times), even on days when, due to a time zone change, I was dead tired and wanted to skip it, I still did it. When I was on a bus in Canada at 11:00pm and realized that my SRS was still not finished, I did it there on the bus (With my laptop). Even when sick, I would do it. Why? Because SRS programs lose effectiveness when not used daily. I realized pretty quickly my SRS program wasn&#039;t something I can approach casually, I required serious commitment. I had no excuse to ever miss a day. Like the marketing people tell you, &quot;Just do it.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz you should talk about, how you improved you&#039;re writing skills in Japanese. I&#039;ve always been interested in the writing portion a lot. I do kana to kanji production in my SRS when I&#039;m adding sentences, I just to mix up the sentence with kana-kanji and kanji-kana. But yea, did you do any other techniques to help with you&#039;re writing? or did it naturally get better with immersion+kana to kanji production SRS cards?  Or was it that, you kept writing and writing and writing that it became naturally part of you&#039;re gaining skills in you&#039;re Japanese? For me personally i was thinking of just keep writing and doing the same things I&#039;m doing, but try writing basic grammar sentences,regular speech sentences,etc. Unno just to get a feel for it i guess.]]></description>
