					<description><![CDATA[I think the major point is that getting started is the most important thing. You hear all the time about people who have a 20-page paper due next Monday and they just can&#039;t get started. The reason I succeeded in my Composition classes is because I set out to write 2-3 sentences or an entire paragraph and just stop, no strings attached. When other people are dreading the whole process, you&#039;ve already started. As you go further, 30-45 minute timeboxes are the norm, but it&#039;s important to get those small starts in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve clearly used this method to accomplish great things, so I&#039;m trying to put my skepticism aside... I see how this would apply to something like cleaning the house, but I&#039;m having trouble seeing how it can be applied to larger, more complicated and cognitively intensive tasks. For example, a 20-page paper for a college class.

If I could only work in spurts of 90-120 seconds, I might finish 2 or 3 sentences at a time. Sometimes I wouldn&#039;t even finish one sentence. If I then had to switch, when I came back I&#039;d have to spend most of the timebox figuring out where I left off in the argument and getting myself back in that train of thought. Then it would be time to switch again.

I guess I&#039;m saying that while I see the benefits of frequent task-switching (novelty bringing more mental energy and interest), there are also costs. Some tasks just seem more suited to spending 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or even an hour immersed in focused work.

What do you think about that? Am I misunderstanding how the timeboxing method applies to tasks like writing a paper? Or are the some tasks that work better with timeboxing than others, and if so how should we decide when to make use of this technique?

Thanks for this blog, it&#039;s been very helpful to me. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice addition!!

Oh yeah, here&#039;s a pretty interesting science article. According to this study, even people who were born and raised in their L1 environment may have trouble understanding very simple sentences. This suggests a foreigner could very well learn an L2 better than a person who has spoken  this languageas their L1 their whole lives.
