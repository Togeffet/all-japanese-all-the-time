					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently working through Heisig&#039;s simplified Hanzi 1, and will soon be finished. There&#039;s no way I&#039;m waiting for the next one to come out; I&#039;m planning on using zhongwen.com. Does anyone have any advice on how to approach using it for learning (simplified) hanzi? Also, does anyone have any tips about what new primitives to look out for, things not included in simplified hanzi 1?

For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;ve also been incorporating pronunciation in my mnemonics, and I would recommend it to others because I actually find it very easy. I assigned the tones colours, and giant/fairy/dwarf/teddy as in Tuttle. I also link it to either a similarly pronounced English word, or hanzi with the same pronunciation (note - if you do this make sure you keep the tone cue separate from the sound cue or you might end up in a confused mess!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tip! I really like ditching Heisig&#039;s and making my own stories up.  Since I don&#039;t have time to write fiction (I, like, have all this Chinese to learn), it&#039;s my favorite time of the day.  Plus, I get all 头疼 trying to figure out when the Japanese is different and when it&#039;s the same.  I occasionally look at Japanese references and there are so many tiny little differences that just drive me crazy.  Sometimes it&#039;s like traditional and sometimes it&#039;s like simplified, and sometimes it means something completely different.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ivan, 

No, I&#039;m like you--I&#039;m celebrating my 10th year with these characters.  I totally agree with you, but I&#039;m trying it Heisig&#039;s way just to see if it works.  If not, then I&#039;ll ditch it and go back to &quot;the part of the body that sounds like &#039;yi&#039;&quot; (which makes much more sense).  

So far Heisig&#039;s method has played with my head quite a bit.  &quot;Elementary&quot; for example, just confuses me, but then I think through his story (cloak and dagger / &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot;) and I find myself writing the character I know well, 初.  Since I&#039;m doing this because it&#039;s easy characters like 初 that I find myself forgetting how to write and feeling like an idiot for it all the time, I&#039;m inclined to believe that ditching the phonetics in remembering the strokes may be a good thing.  Or it may just mess me up.  Only time will tell.  

I do feel it&#039;s helping though.  The color-coded characters by tone is amazing useful.  Now I always think of 辉 as bright orange (my 1st tone) and 守 as dark purple.  (Incidentally, I think they have to be ugly colors, else they&#039;re harder to remember.)  I may start putting the colors in the stories, too.  

I don&#039;t think it would be hard to do this starting from scratch.  I mean, Chinese kids learn tones and writing simultaneously, so how hard can it be?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Ivan - I would tend to agree. It works wonders with names in my case. I always associate 雛(chick) to 雛見沢(name of a village in the anime Higurashi no Naku Koro ni) and 沙(sand) to 沙都子(Satoko). That way, I get both the meaning and pronunciation bagged. Then again, this process is extremely slow (though the characters remain very sticky for a long time).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amelia, I think we both agree to disagree with Heisig on studying pinyin or bopomofo. Throwing sounds out completely may be best for Japanese, with it&#039;s abundance of characters with multiple readings which can only frustrate a learner trying to grab them all at once, but it&#039;s not necessarily such an advantage in Chinese, where 多音字 are rarer.

In my case, I had started studying Hanzi long before I even heard of Heisig, so I ran into quite a few characters whose sounds I was very familiar with and it helped me to remember with much more accuracy than any story I could think up. I remember staring at 胰 and trying to think of a story. Flesh/Moon + Barbarian = Pancreas. Huh. 

What&#039;s the pronunciation of 胰 in Mandarin? Yi2. And, from past study, what&#039;s the pronunciation of 夷? Yi2. 

At that point, I ended up writing in the &#039;story&#039; column: &#039;You aren&#039;t coming up with a good story about the fleshy barbarian pancreas anytime soon. The sound is &#039;yi2&#039;, like barbarian, and the flesh radical indicates meaning. Remember those two and you&#039;re set.&#039;

I don&#039;t know, though. This may be a situation unique to those, like me, who had already spent many long hours desperately banging our skulls against what seemed pre-Heisig to be the impenetrable, unconquerable wall of Hanzi needed for fluency. Maybe, if starting from scratch, sound-based mnemonics would be too much of a pain. I couldn&#039;t say for certain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m at 400 or so, and I&#039;ve found that ignoring Heisig&#039;s advice about skipping the pinyin is best.  I got this book on mnemonics, &quot;Brain Rules,&quot; for Christmas, and I&#039;ve been learning some interesting things, in addition to Heisig&#039;s insights and the SRS method (which the book also confirms):

--People who suffer from synthaesia--confusing sensory information so all Ts are blue and all 2s are red to them (or whatever)--apparently have better memories for text because this excess information is so consistently coded to the thing they want to remember.  So I&#039;m assigning colors to tones, so all 4th tone characters are red, for example.

--As Heisig points out, the more detailed your mental picture, the better.  So I&#039;m also encoding the tones into the little story I learn for each character.  For 享, xiang3, for example, I&#039;m learning Heisig&#039;s story about a tall child who jumps up to look at birds nests, talk to people in second story buildings, see giraffes at the zoo--but I&#039;m adding the words &quot;jumps up *and down*&quot; to signal to me that I should be thinking of up-and-down motion when I imagine the character.  Adding these little bits into the stories is almost always easy (go up the road, go down the hill, etc.).  Of course, it may not pan out--so far this is just an experiment.  Obsessive listening is still the best way to learn tones, but every bit helps.

--Aromatherapy may be unscientific, but studies show that &quot;aromamnemonics&quot; (my word--no respectable scientist would say this) is totally the way to go.  If you smell something when learning and then the same smell is around when you&#039;re trying to remember, you&#039;re likely to remember between 10-30% more than if the smell wasn&#039;t involved.  I&#039;m thinking jasmine tea is pretty ubiquitous in Chinese culture, so I&#039;m keeping that around when I study.

If anyone else has some insights into how to tweak Heisig for Mandarin, I&#039;d love more ideas.  Thanks so much to Khaz to spreading the word--I&#039;m telling everyone I know to get the new Heisig.  But I&#039;m frustrated the new book&#039;s not coming out any time soon (apparently).  I guess we&#039;re on our own for the rest of them in the near term.]]></description>

<p>&#8211;As Heisig points out, the more detailed your mental picture, the better.  So I&#8217;m also encoding the tones into the little story I learn for each character.  For 享, xiang3, for example, I&#8217;m learning Heisig&#8217;s story about a tall child who jumps up to look at birds nests, talk to people in second story buildings, see giraffes at the zoo&#8211;but I&#8217;m adding the words &#8220;jumps up *and down*&#8221; to signal to me that I should be thinking of up-and-down motion when I imagine the character.  Adding these little bits into the stories is almost always easy (go up the road, go down the hill, etc.).  Of course, it may not pan out&#8211;so far this is just an experiment.  Obsessive listening is still the best way to learn tones, but every bit helps.</p>
<p>&#8211;Aromatherapy may be unscientific, but studies show that &#8220;aromamnemonics&#8221; (my word&#8211;no respectable scientist would say this) is totally the way to go.  If you smell something when learning and then the same smell is around when you&#8217;re trying to remember, you&#8217;re likely to remember between 10-30% more than if the smell wasn&#8217;t involved.  I&#8217;m thinking jasmine tea is pretty ubiquitous in Chinese culture, so I&#8217;m keeping that around when I study.</p>
<p>If anyone else has some insights into how to tweak Heisig for Mandarin, I&#8217;d love more ideas.  Thanks so much to Khaz to spreading the word&#8211;I&#8217;m telling everyone I know to get the new Heisig.  But I&#8217;m frustrated the new book&#8217;s not coming out any time soon (apparently).  I guess we&#8217;re on our own for the rest of them in the near term.</p>
