					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, thanks for the article. 

I&#039;ve got a pretty steep request, (which you can turn down, and I will still love you) but recently I&#039;ve been finding myself at crossroads of a kind. 

You know, the easy learning/easy doing process that you teach here definitely works for language. But I&#039;ve been trying to get my head into building some sort of a business. So, I read a bunch of books, entrepreneur forums etc etc. And everywhere I go I see this &#039;grind/sleep is for the weak/all work no play is life&#039; type of mentality. As I am right now, I get really turned off by that. Motivation videos don&#039;t do it for me. Every-time I try it, I three-day-monk.

There&#039;s a certain sort of &#039;barrier&#039; I have towards making other life activities fit the AJATT method of &#039;make the process enjoyable, so you won&#039;t have to deal with motivation&#039;. The feeling is akin to &#039;guilt&#039;. Like, &#039;that&#039;s not real work, that&#039;s you f***ing around.&#039;

My question/request is if you could write a post some-day about how you applied the AJATT method to other aspects of life (if you did). You obviously have a website going, and presumably are at the point in life where you are living on your terms. 

IF you did it the AJATT way, I&#039;d love to get your insights on applying it to other aspects of life, where conventional wisdom states that &#039;hard work&#039; (I&#039;m not mocking the original concept, but the connotations that come with it) is the only way.]]></description>
