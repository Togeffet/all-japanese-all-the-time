					<description><![CDATA[I have a few question, I hope you can answer them:
1. Is there any possible way to translate from English or Spanish to Japanese (kanji, kana, romaji, hiragana or katakana)?
2.  From what language is it better to learn Japanese, with English base or Spanish (knowing that Spanish is my first language, though I understand English very well?
3.  If i learn better by writing, is that a better way or does it makes it actually harder?
4. Any other tips you want to tell me?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you haven&#039;t finished learning the kanji yet, drop everything and go do that.  Children&#039;s stories are, surprising, kind of *hard* in Japanese, because they tend to have few or no kanji.  Kanji are what get you to the &quot;I understand, but can&#039;t quite read&quot; point.
 
I don&#039;t really have any way to know where you are with everything, but my suggestion would be to start using Anki, and SRS a bunch of simple sentences from a *bilingual* source, with reliable translations already present.  (I used the book All About Particles when I started out.  Japanese on the front, reading and translation on the back.)  This will get you the basics down so that you know, when you see a sentence, that &quot;something&quot; is doing &quot;something&quot; to &quot;something&quot; -- then you just have to fill in the blanks with dictionary lookups.
 
Anki is only a tool, and is no replacement for reading a metric ****ton of Japanese, but it will make the process (especially at the start) more efficient if you let it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting translations for words is totally fine. It is the translation of sentences themselves that is advised against. However, in the beginning, translations of sentences isn&#039;t all that bad, so long as you cut yourself off after a certain point. In fact, try getting your first 500-1000 sentences or so to be translated to English. Use sources that already exist such as Tae-Kim&#039;s guide or something to get your example sentences from, or if you want something all-inclusive you could even try the MFSP offered on this site. Once you have that foundation, then it should be easier to make sense of other things later. Learning those 500-1000 sentences will give you a basic understanding of sentence structure -- without even studying sentence structure at all-- which will really allow you to be able to pick up most relatively simple sentences afterward. At the end of this point, you should focus on building your vocabulary around things you are interested in and keep your immersion environment up the whole time.
How long did you try Anki? I felt the same way for the first couple of weeks, but after I got the cards again and again and again, I really started to retain the words.　If you really don&#039;t like the way sentences feel, I&#039;d recommend giving MCDs a try. I mean... I know they might feel even more like you&#039;re just memorizing the answer, but see if after a week or so if you really don&#039;t retain those words better.
One last note... really, don&#039;t worry too much about if you&#039;re fucking things up too much or not. So long as you&#039;re spending time in Japanese, and you&#039;re making an effort to learn it, then you&#039;re likely making progress. Definitely experiment and try things out, but if they don&#039;t work out for you, just go back to whatever it was you were doing before. Learning Japanese is a pretty big commitment, so you should do your best to enjoy it. If there there&#039;s more than one way to reach your goal, take the one you enjoy the most, even if it seems you progress more slowly in it. You&#039;ll enjoy the journey more and be more likely to reach your goal due to the fact that you&#039;re less likely to give up on the way. You can really only learn Japanese once; you should look back on the memories of learning it with a fondness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I get sentences from Japanese children&#039;s stories (or, rather, stories that could reasonably be aimed at Japanese children), like Alice in Wonderland.

But even when I try to reach for the lowest hanging fruit (I have searched quite a bit for very low hanging fruits), I still feel as though I&#039;m fucking things up horribly. I don&#039;t know enough of the words in a sentence to make the sentence mean anything, and I immediately resort to translation as a means of making sense of it (which is apparently what this site is entirely against). I don&#039;t know how to retain words, as I don&#039;t know of any method that leads to me actually learning the words instead of learning the answers to questions I&#039;m asked. (For an idea of what I mean, when I reverse the questions &#038; answers in Anki, I find that I can&#039;t answer any of the questions.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re missing the point of using Anki for sentences, but as for stuff outside of Anki, what is the context of the sentences you find?
Are they sentences in a video game, in a book, on a website? Are you reading it for entertainment? If so, it isn&#039;t really all that important to analyze and break down the sentence. Just read it and keep moving on. You&#039;ll start to become familiar with the unfamiliar this way, and stuff you are already familiar with will start to become second nature. If you&#039;re reading for fun, then you shouldn&#039;t be stressing over your lack of understanding. If you can&#039;t understand enough of it to be able to enjoy it, consider reading something else and coming back to it later.
If it is reading to acquire understanding of the sentences *cough* really, the principle of low hanging fruit would apply here too. If you have no idea what a sentence means, you should skip over it until you find one that you can relatively easily figure out. What method are you using to help you retain your vocabulary and usage of these words? As ブライアン pointed out, you really don&#039;t need to fully understand the sentence or why everything was said the way it was. This is how it is said, who cares why at this point. When you learn more, you&#039;ll instinctively figure out why in most cases.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really?  That is your major concern?  Are you a thinking being or are your neurons just arranged in that pattern by coincidence?  Because that&#039;s the argument you&#039;re making here.
 
Stop second-guessing your brain.  Stop that.  Your brain works in patterns, it is *really* good at picking them out even with incomplete data.  So even if you&#039;re &quot;just happening&quot; to get it right, it&#039;s still reinforcement of the right answer, and it still helps to lay groundwork for later.  Feed it more and any errors will work their way out.
 
Here&#039;s a tip:  when school said you *had* to reason out your answers to understand, they were *lying*.  You are not in school, you are learning.  What matters is that you get the gist and move on so that you can do more.  Being able to explain &quot;why&quot; is not part of the exercise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d argue to not worry about it too much. There have been a few times where I later found out I learned something incorrectly because of a similar issue, but once I realized it, it took little effort to correct. Once you improve, these things will later just become obvious to you, like those mistakes were to me when I was going through my Anki reps.
 
Even if you don&#039;t entirely understand (but should have at least a general understanding of) the sentence at the moment, if you&#039;re getting something out of it, then that is what really matters.
 
Instead of stressing over if you understand one sentence, you could be spending that effort learning other sentences on top of that one. I&#039;d say just enter it in Anki and let it do its thing. Perhaps in a week or two, you&#039;ll understand the card perfectly. However, if you find the card painful to review, then you should probably just delete it and not look back.
 
Also, sorry; I really thought I hit reply to your post last time...

					<description><![CDATA[偶然に決まってる

Do you know each of the words in that sentence? Can you understand how they&#039;re being used? Do you know (or at least have a pretty good idea) what the speaker/author was trying to get across when they wrote/said this? If you answered yes, particularly to the last one, then you understand it. Do you have to know each subtle thing about the sentence? (in this sentence there isn&#039;t really any though) Do you have to be able to recall the sentence, or one similar to it, at will? No, not really; however, these things will come with time if you want them.
 
Also, when you start doing sentences, you should start bilingual. During this bilingual phase, you should try to use cards that will help you get a basic understanding of how sentences are structured. This should help when trying to figure out sentences when you go monolingual.
 
If you still can&#039;t figure out a sentence, then you&#039;re not ready for it yet. Look for something easier -- low hanging fruit -- and learn that for now. If you want, you can come back to that difficult sentence later and it may not be as difficult.]]></description>
