					<description><![CDATA[I like your approach and it is true.  You really do need to sort of carve a new space in your head where you ARE Japanese and where you express your Japaneseness :D If you speak multiple languages and you switch back and forth for whatever reason, you may not realize it but your whole body, your mannerisms, your posture all change in subtle and not soo subtle ways. Like when you speak to older folks or kidds.  You&#039;re not just suddenly speaking another language, or even suddenly expressing yourself in Japanese terms because there are topics you wouldn&#039;t bring up or broach in one language because it would just feel weird or leave a sour taste in your mouth. There are jokes that have no value in other languages but in their natural context make something greater that is unspoken in that culture become tangible or take form.  So its not about being familiar with a new language but rather being familiar with yourself as a representative of that society/culture.  Thank you

					<description><![CDATA[Nice blog!

I just started my journey on learning Japanese.¬† I have to say that the written language provides so much pleasure to my geometrical mind and a bit of effort to my right hand.¬† Every morning my friend and I¬†have to commute for almost an hour and we have ran out of things to say to each other, plus we both are learning Japanese.¬† Is there any audio course that we could play in our CD player so we can practice basic pronunciation while driving?
