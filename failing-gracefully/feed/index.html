					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;ve been experiencing this lately with getting back into the swing of college. Sometimes I&#039;ll do like 2/3 of the reps one night and the remainder 1/3 before going to school. Or other times I&#039;ll just do as many as I can so the review count for the next day isn&#039;t as high as it would be if I stopped. I&#039;ve been trying to think of ways of avoiding future situations where my reps don&#039;t get done than worry about reps I didn&#039;t do in the past and at the very least it doesn&#039;t feel as bad.]]></description>
