					<description><![CDATA[A new post that*s surprising, it might not be a tip but it seems to be overlooked but you`ve got to practise writing in Japanese ( or whatever language you are learning.) And like khatzumoto says immerse yourself play Japanese videos, read Japanese, and play videos in your target language. Also I recommend using Anki to make flash cards. I`ve only being doing AJATT for 2 months after already studying Japanese for a year myself so i can`t really say much as I`m still new at this but just by immersing myself not only has my vocabulary and understanding increased but also my confidence. Also you can`t fail if you are nearly constantly in Japanese. As long as you do most things in Japanese you`ll be fine.]]></description>
