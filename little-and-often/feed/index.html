Sure, its going to be a long journey but &quot; a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step&quot;.  As my school is a music nazi during lectures(2 hours of no music) and then I keep forgetting to turn on my music right after class to keep myself immersed.

It really all reminds me of an dispute I just had last night, in which one particular woman had been boasting how she wnet through years of pain to learn Japanese.

In other words, do things that are &quot;painful but worth it.&quot;  She also scoffed at input over output.  Sad, really.
