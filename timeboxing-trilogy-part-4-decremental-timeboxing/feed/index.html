					<description><![CDATA[When I read a textbook using 30 minute time boxes, it felt too easy at the beginning. After a few sessions I got tired, so 30 minute periods seemed too long. Consequently, I switched to 15 minute sessions. The problem is the first 15 minute periods feel too easy. I’ll try a decremental time boxing. I’ll do 30 -&#062; 25 -&#062; 20 -&#062; 15 minute sessions thereafter.  
P. S. When I have a short break between study sessions, I lie on the sofa and do nothing. I think listening something in your target language could be a good break activity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ Michael

Whenever I&#039;m doing a time-box task like Kanji, I like to have a TV show, etc. on in the background.  During the short breaks between time-boxes I&#039;ll just kick back, enjoy the show, and munch on some snacks.  That way I don&#039;t have find something to do, it&#039;s already there.  Variety Shows are _excellent_ for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love these articles, and especially your writing style! There are a few things I am confused about though:

1. You say that one only needs a single timer for decremental timeboxing. How it different than dual timeboxing, in this sense?
2. How long should one break for between timeboxes, and what are recommended activities?

Thanks! :)]]></description>
