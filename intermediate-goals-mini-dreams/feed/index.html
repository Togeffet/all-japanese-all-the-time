					<description><![CDATA[I agree with this but what about shorter goals. Like daily goals. I find that monthly goals are good, more motivating and less stressful than the long term ones, but I also notice that feeling of being addicted comes from the micro goals. I know there is a post on time-boxing as micro goals but I&#039;m thinking more along the lines of learn how to write one really awsome sentence. Then you&#039;ve created value for yourself, instant achievement, except what&#039;s the point of having it if you don&#039;t use it. So go to the mall and write that sentence on napkins and leave them on tables. Removable graffiti. There, now the value is being used so it actually affirms itself. Then learn another. 

Learn all the words for all the foods to order a single meal from a restaurant, then go to that restaurant and order than meal. 

These are little wins that are wins even outside the contexts of the long term goal, that&#039;s what makes them such victories. 

Another example is in programming. You could either study a bunch of examples of a bunch of concepts, or you could pick one concept and just learn what it means. Then think of a way to use it to improve your life. Then learn how to code it while doing so.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this article, but I&#039;m not sure about the last third that mentions one month goals and such. 

I love making intermediate goals and having mini-dreams. Getting to (n)-hundred/thousand Kanji brings out such motivation. But I find that as soon as I put a deadline on these goals, it becomes work and the wheels fall off the cart. 

Japanese shouldn&#039;t be, &quot;Okay, by next month, I&#039;m going to have watched 250 episodes of anime&quot;, it should be, &quot;Time for a marathon of my favourite anime!&quot;

And what&#039;s even worse is if you get through your month of dutifully watching those 250 episodes, you feel that next month, you have to do the same or better. Inevitably, you won&#039;t do your quota, and you&#039;ll feel like a failure, burned out, and that you don&#039;t have the &quot;will-power&quot; or determination to learn Japanese.

Mini-Goals = Sense of Achievement
Mini-Goals + Deadlines = Inevitable Sense of Failure]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this comment is relevant, so here it is.
I like to use concept maps to display this kind of idea. I never make any though, just imagine &#039;em. But they&#039;ve got branches that go like: Immersion - Music - Rock - LM.C - Punky Heart - Chorus - Chiisa na tsubasa o hirogete - tsubasa - wing. They&#039;re kinda like that. I think it&#039;s pretty cool. I would&#039;ve typed some of that in Japanese but I&#039;m using my Grandma&#039;s &quot;compy&quot; witch doesn&#039;t have the font support or whatever it&#039;s called. (WAH! I want my reps to be kanji and not blocks... *sniff)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of setting goals. I never really thought about it until I read this page though. I remember when I was younger and skateboarding that&#039;s exactly what I&#039;d do. Things like &quot;I want to ollie off the ground&quot; turned into &quot;I want to kickflip&quot; then into &quot;I want to Kickflip smith that 8 set rail&quot;. I never did that last one, but I could&#039;ve!

Same thing applies to this. Right now I&#039;m at about 150 kanji after a week. By the time school starts I want to be at 400. And although I don&#039;t quite understand full sentences yet, I&#039;ve started mining things I personally say using the kanji that I&#039;m studying at the moment. Soon I&#039;m going to be getting me a dictionary and volume 1 of Kenichi. Thanks for the advice Khatz. It&#039;s helping a lot!]]></description>
