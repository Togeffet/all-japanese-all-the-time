					<description><![CDATA[&quot; You have made this English thing such a habit, it literally stays in your head even when you get in a plane, go up into the stratosphere, cross an ocean, get away from America…and still…in your head…there can be English.&quot;

^^ You know what, I&#039;m super confident that following (or rather, adapting) your method would work because I really believe in what you were saying~ I&#039;m Malaysian and my first language was Malay but currently, my primary language is English because I made it that way. When I was a kid, like 7 or 8, I only spoke Malay..then my parents got worried that I couldn&#039;t speak English (its considered a disadvantage) so at one point they only answered my questions if I spoke in English. :p Quite severe, no? Haha. Then I got dorky and got into The Beatles and I watched their movies and documentaries everyday without fail, even though I didn&#039;t understand it. Immersion is really important! But in the case of learning Japanese, its harder because the first Step is Kanji.....

I was totally doubting this method, but after reading this post, I was reminded of what I did previously, so hopefully it&#039;ll work this time too! :) Learning Japanese by watching Arashi tv shows? Haha...i&#039;ll let you know if it works~]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Flo
I still review my Kanji. My card setup: On the front, English keyword and a word or phrase in japanese that uses the Kanji, but with the Kanji not showing. On the back is the Kanji, and the story associated with it. And I rarely have to read the story. So there&#039;s not that much english involved :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question, if you don&#039;t mind.
In AJATT, you advise us to avoid any english. I&#039;ve already finished Heisig for a while, and I&#039;m in the immersion phase (I try to do everything in japanese). But when I review Heisig with the SRS, obviously the reviewing process involves english (because we have to find the kanji from the english key-word).

So I was wondering how you guys (AJATTers or Khatz) deal with it: do you still review Heisig every day despite the use of english that it involves?
Or do you use SRS just for reviewing sentences?
I really want to know your thoughts about that, please.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting, do want to know what happens next. But recently I was thinking of myself what ways can I do to improve japanese, but the answer was in front of me, kick the immersion factor up a notch by not watching anything in English(if possible) and making my computer Japanese,browser Japanese, youtube,etc anything I use. And use more monolingual sources, to adjust my brain into japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[OMG cliffhanger!!! I feel some what like Maddie (at least in the very beginning when I knew 0 Japanese) but I&#039;ve been doing a whole lot better with my immersion.  My motivation is still there everyday when I wake up and go to sleep.  I even sleep with Japanese audio children stories on and wake up with it still playing.  I have dreamed of japanese words and songs that I&#039;ve listened to (even Jdrama shows).  It may not be the exact Japanese words though but I get some here and there.  I started studying this past January and now I know about 100+  Kanji (just meanings while 20 in pronunciations) and I&#039;m a whole lot better in reading Hiragana.  Still need work with Katakana but with this site I tell you, it changed me and I&#039;m sure you get a lot of people telling you that.  What you write is the truth.  It has helped me get to where I am going now.  To me your like a celebrity :-). どうもありがとうございます]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sandra, Grats! keep up the work!

Vivian (my baby daughter) gets lots of Japanese around her and I wonder which language she will try and speak first, English or Japanese. Though I think English simply because her Dad doesn&#039;t speak Japanese hardly, though he responds to the Japanese I speak to him in.

I make him take it lol, and he already knows stuff just from me repeating it without giving English translations. So I guess if anything, she&#039;ll at least understand a majority if she doesn&#039;t speak it.

Also reading children books to her at this time is nice. She doesn&#039;t know English from Japanese, and I can get away with my horribleness and slow reading to boot! hahaha! She is happy I think just hearing me talk to her. Win Win!]]></description>
