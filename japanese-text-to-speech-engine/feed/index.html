					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just wondering if there would be a way to make a bookmarklet similar to that of the nonstoptube and google bookmarklets in which i could highlight text, click the bookmarklet and have that highlighted text appear in the http://voicetext.jp/ text box with a Japanese voice already preselected. Then it would just be matter of mining a sentence, listening to it and moving on.
if anyone knows how to go about making such a thing, please let me know... or you could just, ya know, make thus said little time saver and pass it on :)]]></description>

Just thought you&#039;d like to know that the link here doesn&#039;t work anymore. I tried to find a different one, but I couldn&#039;t. Do you know the status of this project?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just like you said, an improvement. If you put in a single sentence in Japanese, like &quot;„ÉÜ„É°„Ç®„ÄÅÊâì„Å£ÊÆ∫„Åô„Åû&quot;, then you can&#039;t tell the machine from a human being. But when you put in a whole paragraph, it starts to sound odd in certain places--the pauses are a bit off, etc. Not perfect, but definitely a step up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very interesting. The English is still a tad stilted, but it is certainly an improvement. How does the Japanese compare? To me, a beginner, it sounds fairly natural. How is it in reality?]]></description>
