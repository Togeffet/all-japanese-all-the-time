					<description><![CDATA[I, this post have nothing to do with the article, but anyhow. 

I&#039;m reading your article, and i think your method works, just beacouse one fact: i already use it, withouth knowing that is a learning method (sort of), i just do what i like to do in english.

I&#039;m an italian guy, and i know english ewll, not thanks to school or things like that, but becaouse i practice for myself, reading article like that in english, tv and internet shows, posting in english forum, ecc... 

Also, i already know italian a difficult (and beautiful) language , plenty of verb, grammatical form: a really grammar mess! (many people i know doesn&#039;t know how to use a 	subjunctive well, or make mistake with the past verb, and they&#039;re native like me!)

So, why i can&#039;t learn japanese in the same way? I think i can. I already delete all my english and italian song from my ipod, and listen only japanese song, and i started from today to see anime without subtitle and so on.]]></description>
