					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a jazz reedman. I&#039;m also 40+ years self-taught. However, that is much less common once you get away from instruments like guitar, bass and keys. There is an unquestioned assumption that your playing is 90+ per cent your theory plus your technique, and that you&#039;re always going to keep those things in the foreground of why, and how, you play. 

And because there&#039;s a lot less room for jazz to be played and heard these days, I do find that basically all the horn players who get any exposure come from that world where theory and technique are 90% of the music. When we get together online and trade tips, they&#039;re almost all about this or that scale, arpeggio, etude, or &quot;reified abstraction.&quot; 

So jazz, which of course originated in the &quot;African way,&quot; has become almost completely taken up with the &quot;Western way.&quot; Along with a fair bit of Anglo-Saxon masochism (search this blog for that term) - as a professional, you may not practice it, but you don&#039;t question its results in others.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is such a great post that 8 years later, I can&#039;t refrain from commenting, either! It&#039;s super interesting that that&#039;s the &quot;African Way&quot;, because I think that the African Way is just African pedagogy retaining what we&#039;re all born with and what we naturally gravitate towards by focusing on organic, harmonious knowledge acquisition. I say this because I was born in Country X with my L1, and then my family moved to the US when I was 5. We spoke L1 at home and I did tons of supplementary homework in L1, but by the time I ended up back in a classroom in Country X at age 10, English had effectively become my L1 and my native-native language was already super slow/rusty. My first class on my first day at this school was, incidentally, English, and we had a test on &quot;the three forms of the verb&quot;, so there was this long list of verbs and two blank spaces next to each one. Um. I turned in a blank piece of paper because I had no idea what on earth was going on, and my English teacher was just as confused, because she&#039;d been told that I actually do speak English and pretty much only English. Anyway, all of this to say that this makes perfect sense and should be the standard for language learners everywhere!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Fantastic post!
I was especially intrigued by how Dholuo is explained by &quot;who you&#039;d believe to have been a westerner&quot;. I always found the whole idea of Chinese being tonal, and Turkish being agglutinate (both are languages I&#039;d really like to be fluent in) very disturbing (and I must admit, hard to wrap my head around!). That was until I searched wikipedia for &quot;Luganda&quot; - a language virtually understood by all Ugandans, and which I happen to speak more fluently than my mother tongue. Apparently, Luganda is not only tonal, but also an agglutinating language! I also found out it has things such as &quot;germinate consonants&quot; and &quot;slightly labialised labiodental fricatives&quot;... Christ! I learnt this language before I could even spell &#039;slightly&#039;! I&#039;ll just go and start speaking these languages, and not fret about their descriptions.

By the way, just started reading your blog (learnt through Benny - Fi3M), and I love it! Bookmark added!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently had a discussion about this with a friend of mine. She was convincing me that you need to learn grammatical rules and structures in order to put together sentences. I argued that I don&#039;t need to know how a sentence is assembled as long as I can assemble it :D 

Like other people here said, I learned English just by watching shitloads of Cartoon Network as a kid. Like hours a day, every day, for a couple of years. English was actually one of the few subjects I liked in school because it was so easy - I already knew it. I could chill out during class, not study a damn thing and consistently get great grades. The teachers didn&#039;t bother me either because they saw I knew my shit. And all because of cartoons. Who would&#039;ve thought, huh? ;) 

Anyways, you nailed it with this post. Then again, you do with pretty much every post :D Keep them coming. I&#039;m off to watch Live free or die hard in Japanese. [OK, side note. If some of your are poor fucks like me or jewish, you can find Hollywood (and Japanese) movies dubbed and subbed in Japanese by using Perfect Dark. Google it. Khatz, I&#039;m not sure what your policy about blatant pirating instructions in the comments is, but I guess we&#039;ll see :D {Side note 2 - I have nothing against jews xD}]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Normally, my way of learning a game is to first have a feeling of the subject, then read about advanced stuff about it... Then just play it naturally again. Up to now, this is what I&#039;ve been doing with japanese: Listened a bunch of anime to get a feeling of it (despite not wanting to learn the language yet), then started studying it (that&#039;s where I&#039;m at), and as soon as I can understand good enough, I&#039;d simply start throwing myself in a bunch of japanese game to make my knowledge natural.

It is also how I do to remember the Kana and Kanjis: Learn the character first, see if I can remember it naturally, and if I don&#039;t, I look for a tip to remember it (like あ looking like an Apple) and practice it until it becomes natural enough that I don&#039;t have to remember the tip.

The problem with me learning the &quot;African Way&quot; is that I think too much with logic. If I find logic in something, I remember it easily, while if I don&#039;t, I rely on my memory which is very bad. And this is why learning Japanese is hard for me, it is not a language of logic. But I persevere, and try to immerge myself more and more often into japanese.]]></description>

I relate so well to this chapter because of my native tounge (the so called swedish language). Which is so naturally learned by its people some of it can&#039;t be explained by grammar and has zero grammatical rules. . .which sucks for the poor students but alas.
And as for myself I didn&#039;t even know a spot of grammar before 18 but that didn&#039;t stop me from winning short story contests and acing swedish class.
I can also distinctly remeber my teacher saying &quot;subject, verb conjugate&quot; in spanish class but as for the spanish itself. . .not so much heh
well I&#039;ll get back to reading now.]]></description>

Except for the cultural elite who considers ability to use several languages a sign of cultural superiority, and some young people who think it&#8217;s fun to communicate with people.<br />
As far as I know, this goes for the rest of the Europe as well.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[1）昔、好きな友人は私にＸＪＡＰＡＮの　「ＣＩＲＣＬＥ　ＯＦ　ＬＩＦＥ」を聞かせた。　あの歌が３０分間なんだってばよ！それに、ピアノと太鼓を弾く者は piano bangingしなきゃ。この友もピアノを弾けるの。　あの歌にはsheet musicを買って私に見せてあのpiano bangingしなきゃ所に何も書かれなかったのよ。
2）４週間前ＸＪＡＰＡＮはＮＹに来て　新聞にそれについてを読んだんだ。日本語を分からない友に訳詞を送ってあげた。エメールで　”一番じゃなくて編集して方がいいかもしれないのに、どうぞ”って書いた。
３）５年間学校でラテン語の授業に居て、先週、同じ正確な会話したのよ！そして、勝本のような同じ事を言ったわよ！驚くはずかぃ？勿論じゃないもん。以上を読んだ時遠い昔前にとっくに見出したの。

					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Western Way&quot; can be nice and good to deal with unforgiving things  like chemicals that might explode in your face, or to prepare you to actually go learn, but I agree with you that many times, you should just go do it instead of fussing so much.

One example I can think of is computers/cell phones. My father (who is a reasonably tech-savvy man) reads the manual and still has trouble getting something to work. I (who admittedly have a degree in computer science, but no personal familiarity with the actual issue at hand or anything really close) fiddle with it for a minute, looking through menus and options, trying things out, and maybe looking at the manual once as a reference on a specific nuance. And I figure it out right away. xD Most of this stuff is not as hard as we make ourselves think it is, or if we make small mistakes, it&#039;s no big deal. Again, the only time it&#039;s really necessary is when a small false step can have catastrophic consequences (like nuclear physics), so we have to be careful and paranoid before we do anything.

I still like linguistics and analyzing language stuffs, but that&#039;s more for fun and context than for practical use. /geek]]></description>
