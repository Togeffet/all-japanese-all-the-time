					<description><![CDATA[Regret isn&#039;t regret? Man, next thing you&#039;ll tell us is that hookers aren&#039;t hookers and blow isn&#039;t blow!

But yeah, indecisiveness gets you nowhere as I can attest. The only reason I&#039;m not able to understand the majority of the Japanese I see and hear is because I was indecisive about how to learn for years (different things at different times, but still indecisive).
Now that I&#039;ve decided, everything is progressing. Even if it isn&#039;t always going smoothly, it&#039;s still going and that&#039;s what counts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here is one of my favorite quotes, might have been tweeted by you khatz, but I saved it (as I do all inspiring quotes):

&quot;Better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly.&quot; - Robert Schuller

There is no perfect system or method, just start with something. I started with Rosetta Stone believe it or not, and while searching for something better I eventually ended up here. One of the only ways to know if something is worth it is to try it and see, then you will know. Also you start a journey that may lead you to the thing that is right for you, but if you don&#039;t take that first step you may not find it. It also helps to try out different things, you get some bonus experience points even if you end up ditching one thing for another.]]></description>
