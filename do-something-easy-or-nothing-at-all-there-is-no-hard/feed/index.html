					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s it - &quot;studious&quot; can mean absorbing, nourishing - even relaxing if you have the right attitude.

I think I&#039;ve always found SRS reps interesting in themselves, because the subject matter of course motivates me.  And the better I get - or the less I suck - the more interesting it gets, because I appreciate and retain the nuances of the material better.

But I had trouble fully enjoying it because to me, it was simply maintenance, not progress.  Adding SRS cards was like shopping for funky new Japanese hipster clothes, reviewing them like doing the laundry. :(

But I feel now that adding an SRS card to a deck is like adding a weight disc to a barbell - it&#039;s just the starting point.  Then you gotta start the heavy lifting. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reviewing cards is not so much a chore, as long as you make sure they&#039;re not too hard (ideally, I find they individually should include one or two recently learned new concepts at most), not too easy (stuff that you can already read without a problem), and not too long.
Having silly ones helps too. One of my favorites, which I got from Uncyclopedia (http://bit.ly/mTFc25 , and which kind of breaks the too long rule, but it&#039;s fine because it&#039;s awesome) is: Âæì„Å£„Å¶„ÄÅÂêçÂè§Â±ãÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÂÜÖ„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨ÂõΩÊ∞ë„ÅØ„ÄÅ‰∏ÄËà¨ÁöÑ„Å´„ÅØÂêçÂè§Â±ã‰∫∫ÂêåÂ£´„ÅÆ‰ºöË©±„ÇíÁêÜËß£„Åß„Åç„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÇ (Therefore, Japanese citizens in the Nagoya Republic generally cannot understand conversations between Nagoyans.)

					<description><![CDATA[Boredom is sometimes - sometimes! - simply a question of mindset: how you consciously approach or value a particular activity.  One mistake I made initially was to focus exclusively on the number of cards in my SRS deck.  Adding cards was fun, because it was quick, quantifiable progress.  Reviewing cards was a monotonous chore to simply keep from losing what I had already learned.  In reality, of course, reviewing the cards is what really makes them penetrate into your long-term memory.  So each SRS rep is objective progress.  So the value of your SRS deck doesn&#039;t equal the number of cards, but roughly:

SRS deck value = number of cards x average number of reps per card

So you can keep track of your total number of accumulated reps as a measure of progress.  Or rather, since reviewing the same card 20 times in a single hour won&#039;t help a jot, there&#039;s also the time factor.  What counts is reviewing a card many times over a period of time, so :

SRS deck value = number of cards x average  number of reps per card x average maturity of cards measured in months

...Or something like that.  So, time doesn&#039;t take things from you, by making you forget, but objectively helps you by letting things sink in - all the way down to the dank, deep-sea bottom 
of your long-term memory.  So it&#039;s better to start today, and do a little, than in two months from now and do a lot.  A well-aged SRS deck is like a fine wine (or a fine smelly cheese).  :)

So perhaps an ideal would be: 10000 sentences x 10 reps each card x an average of 3-4 months&#039; maturity per card (or whatever make sense mathematically).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Telling yourself to do something hard is the same thing as telling yourself to do nothing at all. &quot; OR, telling yourself to be righteous and do it no matter how much you suffer doing it...

I agree with what you say Khatz: As long as you have in your mind &quot;this is HARD&quot; it will either not get done, or get done in a mediocre way, or get done after too much suffering and perspiration... it&#039;s always better to start as small as one can handle, and from then take on bigger challenges. Thanks again for a short yet insightful post man. Muchas gracias! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not necessarily easy, but fun.  Fun can be very difficult, some of the most rewarding things in life are very, very, very difficult, but people still do them because they&#039;re worth it.
