					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s been sometime since I posted on the AJATT Blog. I was just looking at the comments above and the one that said &quot;14,000 sentences in 6 months&quot; caught my eye. I used to be an srs addict(I loved adding so much cards at once and loved pre-mined ones). But as I kept learning Japanese over the years(I&#039;ve been studying for 2 years now, man time goes by fast). But overtime I actually deleted all my decks and started fresh(this was the only time I actually made a big change to my srs pace) and it went for the best actually. I didn&#039;t delete my RTK deck of course but I revamped my vocabulary deck and sentence deck. I recently purchased a powerful laptop and I am able to maintain my srs reps and immersion for long hours on end. What I&#039;m trying to say here is: there is no need to compare yourself with others, there will always be people better than you. But that doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t gain the skill that they have. Heck, when I started there was so many people ahead of me and were better then me at Japanese. Now, I&#039;m ahead of most people who have been studying for 4-5 years (because I studied intensively and immersed a lot). 
 
Overall my srs decks are only 3 now and I have a solid pace for each of them. Since I&#039;ve srsed a lot before I can handle a fairly large amounts of reps in less than 1 hour each day. That leaves immersion,reading,practicing and having fun as well. I learned that the srs should be used a base for learning but it shouldn&#039;t take too much of your time. I used to srs 70% of the time and immerse only 30%. Now I only srs for 20-30% and immerse for 70-80%(reading,listening,etc) and yet I can srs close to 500-800 reps a day and do them all in less than 1 hr. I&#039;ve masted the way I can learn and how it effects me. Everyone has a different way of handling and learning, so you have to find your own way. Remember, anyone can succeed in learning Japanese but there are very few who keep it up long enough to feel that success. 
 
P.S. on a side note: if anyone is interested, I plan to start a website/twitter/facebook/youtube account for language learning and Japanese subtitling (this one I&#039;m actually working with someone and we hope to create a group that subtitles Japanese/transcription). I&#039;m aiming for the end of this year to have it up and running. 
Lastly, keep learning, keep succeeding, keep having fun(can&#039;t stress this one enough, if your not having fun, then why are you doing it?) and know that you can succeed ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On the topic of running though RtK, they likely know less than they let on because they raced through it. I tried racing through it at first and finished pretty quickly, but had an awful time and basically didn&#039;t remember the second half of the book. I actually restarted and went at a steady pace my second time through, and by the time I finished, I knew every one pretty well. I think by the time I ended, my average number of new kanji per day during that time period was 13.

On the topic of monolingual sentences, don&#039;t worry too much about it. Just play with the dictionary. Look up definitions or words you already know or want to know. Make sentences of the definition if you find it interesting or helpful (I.e. If you enjoyed reading it), but don&#039;t force yourself to make sentences of everything. Last, but not least, keep on deleting in your SRS, and keep on reading interesting material online. If you do these things the adding will increase on it&#039;s own and eventually you&#039;ll be adding 40+ sentences a day and all the reps to go along with that rate of adding with ease.

Remember, there will be plenty of time later for you to be good at using a monolingual dictionary and learning every word you come across. For now, 10 new monolingual sentences a day sounds great, and it&#039;ll only get better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was first introduced to the idea of spaced repetition flashcards, I&#039;ve encountered people who would say stuff about how they have 14,000 or something in 6 months. I was shocked, as I&#039;ve never added them that quickly. While I&#039;ve never quite felt my progress was inadequate or anything, seeing stuff like that makes me seem like a slacker in comparison. But in the end, I don&#039;t need to impress people on teh interwebs with the large number of freeze dried, high sodium instant sentences I&#039;ve acquired in large packs. They don&#039;t matter.
 
I&#039;m still winning anyway.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was first introduced to the idea of spaced repetition flashcards, I&#8217;ve encountered people who would say stuff about how they have 14,000 or something in 6 months. I was shocked, as I&#8217;ve never added them that quickly. While I&#8217;ve never quite felt my progress was inadequate or anything, seeing stuff like that makes me seem like a slacker in comparison. But in the end, I don&#8217;t need to impress people on teh interwebs with the large number of freeze dried, high sodium instant sentences I&#8217;ve acquired in large packs. They don&#8217;t matter.<br />
 <br />
I&#8217;m still winning anyway.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[[Really need an edit button]

I just realised my comment might not seem particularly relevant to this post... What I was trying to say was that we now have real data to support the fact that not only do different people learn at different speeds in the meta(wtf), but each person learns each bit of knowledge at different speeds - therefore there is even less reason to compare yourself to others! :D

Also, I just watched this video(by the same guy) and he exemplifies what he was explaining in the TED talk(with data to back it up): &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C7FH7El35w&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C7FH7El35w&lt;/a&gt; (Start at about 0:25:00, and I think you only need to watch for two or three minutes) if you&#039;re interested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 14 actually, And I&#039;m just starting high school, well, tomorrow.
I started during November of 8th grade when I was 13, Leaving from Korean. Never looked back.
RTK took me about 4 months to complete, and I&#039;ve been on sentences since. I&#039;ve been a slight bit slow with sentences, but luckily I&#039;m picking up the pace and today I got 30 from extreme sentence mining from some vlogs on youtube made by a 13 year old in japan, and ゼルだの伝説時のオカリナ３ＤＳ :D
