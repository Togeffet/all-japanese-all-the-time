					<description><![CDATA[I never understand all the lack-of-progressっぽい felling that all those dudes talk about, since we are always learning new words, listening and reading stuff, we are always facing those words again in real speech, and so the progress shows up, every time I saw those words I became so happy, if the word is one of those I-never-will-see-that-word-again vocabulary, I even start stupid dances or strange sounds with my mouth. And I also never forget how I was when I started, I remember like it was yesterday, understand manga and anime seemed like something so magical and fantastic, and here I am doing all that stuff, living the dream]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this article,
It&#039;s inspiring. What do you think about this Katz:
isn&#039;t language learning like STARTING A WEBSITE (considering that you set the niche and stuff and your good to go), and basically any business venture, right?
Most people dig for the treasure, but they stop inches before the chest when all you have to do is , just keep digging.
ANd I love the acorn metaphor here as well.
And with day trading, you mean short term traders right? I am on Stocks as well but long term, I earned 30% in a yeqar and a half. imagine if that were in a bank, I owuld have earned 2% by now?]]></description>
