					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t experience that with books, since most people don&#039;t even care to literature anyway, but with music the story is different, music is soooo overrated, everybody talks about it as being the #1 to define a human being, when people came at me the first question they make is &quot;what music you like?&quot; and when I answer &quot;no one&quot; they look at me like I was a vegetable without life, like if there&#039;s nothing but music in the world, I do listen to music (アニメソンばかり) but I don&#039;t care to it, I don&#039;t know or like any band, or singer, please leave me alone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Light novels, as bubble said are actually called, ライトノベル , and the trashy stuff usually end in 文庫 (then again almost all publishers end in that, but...!) for example 電撃文庫、スニーカー文庫、GA文庫  just go on amazon.co.jp start from here: http://amzn.to/acuoHk and end up on pages like http://amzn.to/aH8ns7

Enjoy :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[遊・戯・王　for the win!!!
Last night I went to Bookoff and bought about 25 manga and two 乙一 books(the Japanese equivalent of Dean Koontz!)and a newspaper. I started learning Japanese so I can read manga anyway, so if I didn&#039;t read things I like I probably would have quit long ago. I have tons of melodramatic 少女, 少年 complete with swords and a villian or gangsters and guns(GTOが大好き！)

By the way, does anyone know the word for &quot;light novel&quot;? I was trying to explain to the clerk that I wanted to read 時をかける少女(the light novel version) but I had to keep on saying &quot;時をかける少女の本。漫画じゃない。本です。”
Now I&#039;m going to go back to reading Yu-Gi-Oh---in Japanese!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Couldn&#039;t agree more. I didn&#039;t learn to read English by reading fancy literature until I was forced to in highschool, and even then, it wasn&#039;t all that interesting (Great Gatsby and a few others aside, but even those I liked every 5 paragraphs or so, the rest was just filler). I&#039;m a big fan of reading entertaining trash, especially in Japanese.

Right now I love reading books aimed at middle school girls involving witches (黒魔女さん）, and some totally trashy stuff aimed at the average male with something about zombies and hot chicks (これは、ゾンビですか？) and of course the stack of クレヨンしんちゃん 漫画  next to my toilet. 

Adult books are good too, I guess, anything on the best-seller shelf is *readable* to the average person and it&#039;s usually entertaining.  （最近の告白っていう and 卒業っていう come to mind)

But seriously, stay away from &#039;literature&#039;. Even children&#039;s literature (魔女の宅急便) will go on a two page metaphorical rant about a could floating through the sky. You don&#039;t need that. You have more important things to do, like read about how to survive a zombie attack.]]></description>
