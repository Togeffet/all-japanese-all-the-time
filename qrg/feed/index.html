					<description><![CDATA[oh boy. my path to the method that fitted me took me a long time. right now, i dont need any encouragement. i dont know if it happened to others, but after a while, you dont need to know why ajatt works. you... feel it.

but heres some concrete advices:
-it shouldnt be tedious. not the kanji, not adding sentences.
-stop worrying about not remembering kanjis or sentences. how many times have you repeated it? 10? 50? sry, not enough. im sure u had words in english that took u thousands of time before realising that u wrote or pronounced it wrong. get over ur failures and continue.
-im only at 1500 sentences, but i can already tell u that i would of never reached that far without RTK. and i havent even touched the tip of the iceberg. 
- u dont need to follow ajatt to the letter. i dont use audio for reps cuz i do them on my itouch and its faster. dont create some crazy ways either to learn japanese, like learning everything in RTK2. i know its tempting, but ur way better off learning them with real material
-u dont need to follow the above advice. but remember that if u dont like it,  drop it as soon as possible (or leave it for later).

anyways, im off to sleep for now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, and as far as what I&#039;d like to see, it&#039;d be a sort of &quot;how it feels to be at this phase&quot; in terms of milestones.  AJATT is great but the going gets tough for some of us some of the time, regardless of the fact that much of your point is to say &quot;do what you would do in any (your own) other language: be entertained, but do it in Japanese&quot; (if I may sum it up that way).

The fact is that I find Heisig incredibly tedious right now, and I&#039;m just ITCHING to get to the sentences.  So some sort of recognition of that (kind of thing) would be helpful to me, in particular.  Am I making sense?]]></description>
