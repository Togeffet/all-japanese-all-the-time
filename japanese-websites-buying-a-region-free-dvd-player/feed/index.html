					<description><![CDATA[This might save people a few bucks: Most DVD players can be made region-free using certain key combinations on the remote. Search for your DVD player model and &#039;region free unlock&#039; or something like that. I just unlocked my Philips DVD-622 last night. I don&#039;t have any other-region DVDs to test with yet, but the knowledge that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; watch them is thrilling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not in Japanese and for those in Japan it may be less useful if model numbers are different, but I always just go to http://www.videohelp.com/dvdplayers to look up models I&#039;m considering. It will have an entry if there is a known trick to get it to be region free. Last time I bought a dvd player, I got one that was $30 at best buy and it turned out that it could be made region free with a code on the remote and it could also play PAL dvds on an NTSC tv. Unless it has become much harder to become similar players I wouldn&#039;t recommend buying some really expensive one from sites that sell them. Also, on computers you just need the right software to be able to play disks from any region.]]></description>
