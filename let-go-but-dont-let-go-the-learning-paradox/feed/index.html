					<description><![CDATA[This is a great visual &quot;The way you do that is by picking low-hanging fruit.&quot;. People, by nature, would always choose the path of least resistance. And if you know the path is to put out so much effort just to learn a new word, chances are that path will be abandoned.

This concept really will help guide a language learner to view languages not as an epic struggle but a neat little hobby that fits well in their lives.  

&lt;em&gt;&quot;There’s no heroism in struggle. There are no extra points for doing it the hard way. The heroism is in making progress&quot; -  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;well said.&lt;/strong&gt; ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Birds suck at flying, initially.&quot; Ha, this sentence reminded me of a book I read not too long ago, &quot;Guardians of Ga&#039;Hoole&quot;. The two protagonists, Soren and Gylfie are young owls that at one point in the book are learning to fly.

&quot;Grimble demonstrated. He pressed forward just a bit, extended his head and lifted his wings. And that was it - he was suddenly airborne. Twice Soren&#039;s size or more, yet Grimble seemed to float up effortlessly. Would they ever learn? Have they even improved?&quot;

The last bit struck me when I was reading through these passages recently. I (and I believe I&#039;m not the only one) often feel this way about things I am learning, or used to be learning - be it Japanese, rollerblading, riding a bike or speaking English. There was a point in time when I looked at people who could do seemingly effortlessly what I was trying so hard to learn. I too though: &quot;will I ever learn? will I ever be this good?&quot;

But as it&#039;s mentioned several times in the book - to fly, you must believe. If you don&#039;t believe, you won&#039;t fly no matter how much you learn about the theory of flying. But if you believe, you&#039;ll eventually fly, as long as you keep trying. 

There was a time when I confused &quot;have&quot; with &quot;heaven&quot; and when I needed a dictionary to construct a half-assed paragraph in English. There was a time when I would think: &quot;man, it would be so great to know English already&quot;. And here I am now. So I believe there will come a time when I stop confusing kanji, when I can read more than a few Japanese sentences without a dictionary and when I know which particle to use at a given time. 

And I believe that you too should believe :p]]></description>
