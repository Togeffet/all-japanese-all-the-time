					<description><![CDATA[Hi there Katz, 

Well, I have been a fan for a long time, I just wish that I hadnt taken such a long break away, I only took a break because I really did not understand a lot of the things you were talking about. Anyway, I am back into it now, and I remember reading an article about reading manga and folding the pages on sentences. I have looked for about a week now, and cannot find it. I have read the article about sticking dots on interesting parts, and maybe I will just do that. 

If you could tell me the url of that article, that would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

					<description><![CDATA[RE: http://www.amazon.co.jp selling dubbed movies

None of the movies I&#039;m interested have english voiceovers/dubs at my local japanese video store, so I&#039;ve been checking amazon for the past few days.  The thing that is confusing me is the &quot;Language: japanese, english.&quot;  Now from what I have seen just about every movie has:

Format: Color, Dolby, DTS Stereo, Widescreen, etc. (sometimes says Dubbed)
Language: 英語, 日本語 (occasionally another language)
Subtitles: 日本語, 英語, (+whatever random subtitle)

So do the movies need to say dubbed in the format section to have voice-overs? If so, what is the language part for?  

As an example Ratatouille says dubbed in the format list, and also has language + subtitles jp/eng.  Bourne Identity has language and subtitle both listing jp/eng, but does not say dubbed under the format part.  Language clearly isnt for subtitles since sometimes the language/subtitle section do not match, and if you look up blu-ray movies the language is always english only, with japanese subs.  

Some clarification would be helpful since they are really expensive, thank you! :X

(sorry if this double posts, I posted it at work but didnt se the comment when i got home)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[RE: amazon.co.jp for dubbed movies.  

I&#039;ve noticed that just about any movie I&#039;ve searched has:
Format: (usually contains sound information and occasionally says dubbed)
Language: Japanese, English, (and sometimes another)
Subtitles: Japanese, English, (and others)

Only certain movies list &quot;dubbed&quot; in the format part.  For example Ratatouille says Dubbed and also under language says Japanese/english, while The Bourne Identity does not say dubbed but does say Japanese/English under language.  So before I drop 20-30 bones on a dvd,  does it have to say dubbed in the format section or is that what the language description is?  If the language section is not for voiceovers then what is it for, the menu? There is already a subtitle listing so I&#039;m a bit unsure about what the seperate language description is for..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know where to ask this either so I&#039;ll ask it here as it is relevant to TV. 

ok so, by this point my iPod is basically glued to my ear with Japanese podcasts playing(both news and entertainment) 

so I was wondering, 
would it be a good or bad idea, to watch my favorite american(english) shows with no volume on (while i have my iPod on)(or without it doesnt matter) because I would know exactly what is going on and I could kind of add my own Japanese dubs to the show just thinking about it. 

so would that be a good or bad idea?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[うん、また賛成ばかりです。

このスレのトピックとは関係ないけど、勝元は前のトピックで述べた自然環境に関するテレビ番組を観ると参考になる表現が多いので大変勉強になるって言ったでしょう？私的には番組を見るための覚悟は出来ていると思う（ニュースは九割以上理解できるから）

じゃそういった番組のお薦めは何でしょうか？ユーチューブなどでどう検索すればいいでしょうか？

宜しくお願いします

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point, too. It does also depend on the movie (well-written movies tend to have more realistic dialogue). Either way, it&#039;s not like it would hurt, and I don&#039;t want us to go out and say &quot;don&#039;t do X&quot;, any more than we have to. 

The best thing is to just do what you enjoy, I think. All movies movies all the time could get old, all variety shows all the time will definitely get old, but all Japanese all the time :D never grows old.]]></description>
