					<description><![CDATA[While looking for this book I found a similar one called Êï¨Ë™ûÂÖ•ÈñÄ (Keigo 101) that has some similar features.  It is aimed at college graduates who are becoming new Á§æ‰ºö‰∫∫ and as such gives some good practical advice about the right attitude to have in various business situations, as well as example usages of certain expressions.  Rather than simply explaining what to say, it also has information on what to do and the reasons behind what is being said, which is very interesting, no matter your own reaction to the stiffness of some business encounters.  It does suffer from the table layout that you dislike in several portions, but also has good illustrations and diagrams for things like uh... standing position among coworkers in elevators (if you&#039;re lowly like me, you&#039;ll be pushing the elevator buttons for everyone else).

It&#039;s interesting because where I work (school), nobody talks like this, but the situational explanations are informative, easy to read, and common-sensical.  Khatz, did you have a chance to check this book out when you were book-picking?]]></description>
