					<description><![CDATA[HEY KHATZ

You are a computer guy right... How do you think (modern) google translator learned japanese? with grammar, rules and dictionaries? What are you talking? Are you from 1990?

NO

it&#039;s a pattern matching machine. it&#039;s not hardcoded.

GOOGLE TRANSLATOR is PURE 100000000 sentences SRS only without S.... And maybe not much R... Yes it&#039;s bit different but.... 100000000 SENTENCES.

I am disappointed. I thought computers are your friends. 

maybe in 5 years google also uses mcd. hell, maybe they do it now. MAYBE THEY BOUGHT YOUR MCD KIT AND FEED IT NOW TO BIG COLD STEEL MACHINES]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just want to throw this out there, that I changed my OS to Japanese in my first week the RTK phase.

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re using (reading and listening/hearing) Japanese every day, you&#039;re going to see it in other contexts. That&#039;s the point of immersion. Connecting ÊîªÊíÉ with &quot;make them dead button&quot; was the first step (and that&#039;s really an oversimplification. There&#039;s already more context in your game than you seem to think. I haven&#039;t played that specific game, but I&#039;m going to assume the characters you control aren&#039;t just outright killing enemies everytime you press the button. They&#039;re attacking. Enemies probably have the chance to dodge, too. You can dodge an attack, but it&#039;s pretty hard to dodge a &quot;make them dead&quot; I&#039;d assume.) It&#039;s the beginning of the &quot;fuzzies&quot; for that word. That sense that you kinda sorta know that word, but you&#039;re not quite there yet.
Let&#039;s look at some of the example sentences I found on Weblio ËæûÊõ∏&#039;s Ëã±Ë™û‰æãÊñá.

Êïµ„ÇíÊîªÊíÉ„Åô„Çã. - attack the enemy
ÊîªÊíÉ„ÇíÂßã„ÇÅ„Çã. - launch an attack
ÊîªÊíÉ„ÇíÁ∂ö„Åë„Çã. - keep up an attack
ÊîªÊíÉ„Åï„Çå„ÇÑ„Åô„ÅÑÂú∞ÁÇπ. - a vulnerable point
ÊîªÊíÉ„Åæ„Åü„ÅØÊâπÈõ£„Åã„ÇâÂÆà„Çã - defend against attack or criticism

Now, imagine you&#039;re reading a manga or playing a game and a bunch of characters are gathered around a table planning a big mission/raid/etc. and one of them talks about a &quot;ÊîªÊíÉ„Åï„Çå„ÇÑ„Åô„ÅÑÂú∞ÁÇπ.&quot; Now, in this hypothetical example, you already know that &quot;„Åï„Çå„ÇÑ„Åô„ÅÑ&quot; means &quot;easy to do&quot; and &quot;Âú∞ÁÇπ&quot; means &quot;point&quot; or &quot;site.&quot; And you already have that fuzzy feeling for &quot;ÊîªÊíÉ&quot; from before so you can now combine all your knowledge (and this is a mostly subconscious and monolingual process) and you&#039;re going to understand that sentence completely. Even if you wouldn&#039;t know exactly how to translate it in English. Understanding that one sentence in that one context is the next step in understanding those words the next time they pop up.

Words exist as words. Assuming they&#039;re words you see/use on a regular basis, they can&#039;t be irrelevant. It&#039;s impossible to learn them incorrectly. How do you skip words (not counting skimming here) when reading? Words can&#039;t be thrown away, because they are there. You&#039;re going to hear and see ÊîªÊíÉ literally thousands more times in your life. 

Anyways, tl;dr version: Don&#039;t worry about it. There is no &quot;wrong&quot; method to language learning. Some methods are faster, but there is no bad way to learn a language unless you&#039;re just pretending to learn one (taking a class twice a week and doing absolutely nothing else, for example). I know that&#039;s hard to do. I used to fret and worry all the time. I was constantly digging around on language learning blogs and websites always trying to compare methods because I was so afraid I was going to do something &quot;wrong.&quot; I&#039;d make a few SRS cards and then spend hours online comparing them to others&#039; because I didn&#039;t want to do anything wrong. You know when my Japanese finally started taking off? When I calmed down, left all the blogs alone, and started doing fun stuff in Japanese. Just using a J-J dictionary and Anki for about an hour a day picking out words I saw in manga and online or heard in anime and dramas.]]></description>

Or do you think that when you was learning English you instantly knew every meaning of every word in the first time you found them? :)

And eventually figure it out, get a gradual understand of it from a superficial guess, or look it up.</p>
<p>Or do you think that when you was learning English you instantly knew every meaning of every word in the first time you found them? üôÇ</p>
<p>Btw, many words in your native language stay in this state forever, like &#8220;exfoliate&#8221;, the only thing I know about that word is that it have something do to with cosmetics.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s the thing, though: the way I learned ÊîªÊíÉ didn&#039;t prepare me to use it in any other context. Like, if I saw the word in any other context, I would have no idea what it means; I&#039;d learned it wrong and made it irrelevant. Same thing happens with a lot of contextual learning I&#039;ve done elsewhere: it feels less like I&#039;m learning the words (or even taking a step toward learning the words) and more like I&#039;m skipping past them entirely.

I&#039;m not entirely sure what learning a word as a word means, but I know that there are right and wrong ways to learn a word (mostly because I seem to encounter the wrong ones).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Learning ÊîªÊíÉ as &quot;this is the make dudes dead button&quot; is perfectly fine. I mean, that&#039;s what it does, no? But what happens when you&#039;re watching a movie and you hear some soldiers planning a ‚ÄùÂ•áË•≤ÊîªÊíÉ?‚Äù Think about the words you know in English, they&#039;re stored more as feelings, and every time you hear/see a word in a new context, you&#039;ve just added another layer to that feeling.  Dictionary lookups and SRS are all about helping you better establish that &quot;feeling.&quot; The more you see a word in more and more contexts, the stronger this feeling gets. Once you&#039;ve gotten down the &quot;attack&quot; feeling for ÊîªÊíÉ, your brain&#039;s not going to have much issue seeing it used similarly to &quot;criticize&quot; later on.

					<description><![CDATA[The one thing that I&#039;m self conscious about (and I speak from analogous experience) is that I&#039;ll learn incorrectly. I&#039;m not sure how to explain it too well, but essentially, I&#039;d learn these words as functions rather than as words, if that makes any sense. Like, when I was playing Tear Ring Saga in the original Japanese (that was the analogous experience), I learned ÊîªÊíÉ (or whatever it was) as &quot;this is the make dudes dead button&quot;, completely skipping past learning it as a word. (Maybe it&#039;s a bit strange that I&#039;m using a word I remember as an example, but that&#039;s how memory works.) I feel like something very similar would happen with the OS switch. Maybe that&#039;s what you&#039;re talking about with memorization, but I&#039;m not entirely sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sure, I have some patience.  But If I&#039;m bored, my eyes WILL shift away and I&#039;ll do something else.  My brother thinks I have alot of patience because I&#039;ve done this for about 9 months now.

Most of the time, I&#039;ve had ALOT of fun too.  I simply never figured out what I will do with &quot;fluency&quot;.

Also, people want to see the Japanese I know but I never find an appropriate time to show them and they wouldn&#039;t understand if I told them anyways.

I&#039;ve even seen a few people on Youtube outright say that learning a language other than the one you&#039;re born with is VERY racist.  But because of the Internet and most people&#039;s desire to be credible, most of us Americans will have no capacity to read and little power to either learn another language OR improve upon our own English.]]></description>
