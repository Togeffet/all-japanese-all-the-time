					<description><![CDATA[Yup, music can create wonders when learning a language...totally agree with you. Now you said that you are not quite sure why this is right? Now let me tell you a few reasons why music is one of the best language learning tools out there. 
-Memorizing vocabulary is much easier because of the melody that accompanies the words.

-Specific parts of the song are repeated, making it even easier to memorize new vocabulary.

-It is scientifically proven that the brain is able to absorb information at a much faster rate when involved in an activity that you enjoy.

-You will not only learn new words but also how these words are used in sentences at the same time.

For more information visit: http://www.language-united.com/foreign-language-learning-tips.html

However, when I was learning Chinese I found that watching movies was also a great way to improve my language. Now, watching was not really enough, you had to work and analyze them. 
Once your language is at a decent level there is so much you can get out of movies. 

For example: 
You can observe the body language of actors who find themselves in different emotional situations. People of different cultures all have slightly different ways they react to the circumstances they find themselves in. You will find out how the actors use intonation to express their emotions when speaking. 
With this method you will really get the native flow of the language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got a bad K-Pop addiction, too. Like you I&#039;ll listen to the Japanese versions of K-Pop songs. One thing I do is that I&#039;ll always search on youtube for ex. &quot;2NE1 Fire 日本語&quot; that way I can find japanese subtitles to a lot of k-pop songs to keep learning japanese. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I highly recommend スチャダラパー for Japanese hip hop listeners. According to some user&#039;s list on Amazon.co.jp they have two classic albums &quot;5th Wheel to the Coach&quot; and &quot;Wild Fancy Alliance&quot; I found both of them and both are awesome. 5th Wheel To The Coach is one of my favourite rap albums in any language now. The easiest comparison is De La Soul...mostly because they appear on De La Soul&#039;s album Buhloone Mindstate. They make a lot of humourous songs about every day things. Check out this song which is just about how people spend their free time:

					<description><![CDATA[Take this with a mine of salt but from what I understand Tagalog is another one of those languages, like Cantonese but probably even worse, that isn&#039;t really catalogued.  If you watch some of the Filipino channels on TV (dunno if you have but they&#039;re easily accessible in my area) they tend to mix different languages in A LOT.  Like they&#039;ll be speaking paragraphs of Tagalog and then you&#039;ll hear two English sentences then back to Tagalog then sometimes into other dialects like Illongo or something, not to mention sentences in one language with emphasized words in other languages.  I have never actually seen any sort of Tagalog dictionary other than Tagalog-English phrasebooks and about 75% of my friends at one point were Filipino.  Not saying they don&#039;t exist but what I am saying is that you probably will not find any sort of &quot;complete&quot; or even semi-complete dictionaries like there are for well-catalogued languages like English and Japanese.  As for media...maybe you can try finding a stream of TFC (The Filipino Channel) online or something.  Or see if you can get it in your area through your TV provider, if you have one.  Also there was this one band called Slapshock I think that I found pretty alright.  There&#039;s this song called Misterio by them that I had stuck in my head for weeks.  Sorry for my lack of help! T^T  But good luck!  Make lots of friends.  With languages like Tagalog building relationships with native speakers is going to be more or less essential and probably the difference between success and failure.  With languages like Japanese or Chinese we can become fluent without stepping outside of the house but I don&#039;t think everyone has that convenience available. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I will be honet. Khatz!! Thanks for this post. I have been doing Alljapaneseallthetime for about 8 years and really, the only thing that has kept me in the game is music from artist like KREVA, Shimizu Shota, Daichi, Atsushi from Exile, Toshinobu Kubota, Tameoka Sonomi and Sonomi(R&#038;B and Hip but also listen to Remioromen, Hata Motohiro and others). But I wrote this post no to brag about who I listen to per say,, but to state that alot of people, both my american friends and japanese native friends, say that I am fluent in Japanese. I am not talking about the generic &quot;jouzu, jouzu!&quot; pharse that Japanese people say to you when you say Hajimemashite. Im talking about the surprised, baffled look I get after a long 40 conversation about why I am studying Japanese, who I like to listen to as to music and and dramas on tv and also what i would like to do with my japanese. Even as I am writing this I feel like (WHAT DOGG! 4 REAL?! YOU CAN DO ALL THAT). All of this came form srsing, reading a page or two of japanese watching japanese dramas and anime and listening to alot of music. I kill the music but I always felt that this method, although it works SO WELL FOR ME, was kinda stupid because I didnt ram my head with Japnese haikis and newreports and boring stuff like that. Its when I listened to music I like is when I would pick phrases and words that I would look up and them use the next time I had the chance to speak japanese with my friends. FOR REAL!!! Music helps a whole lot. If any of you are curious about music(that is, if Khatz hasnt reminded you of these artist all ready) check out these artist and pick and choose which songs you like. And then kill the song; listen to is repeated so that you can rock the house at kareoke night like I did last weekend sing Kazumasa Oda&#039;s Tokyo Love Story song(Again, NOTBRAGGING, just having fun) Later. Here are some artists that I like...KREVA, Shimizu Shota, Daichi, Atsushi from Exile, Toshinobu Kubota, Tameoka Sonomi and Sonomi(R&#038;B and Hip but also listen to Remioromen, Hata Motohiro and others). Peace.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Music really, really works for me, but I under-use it. A few songs that I&#039;ve become either obsessed with, or had to memorize for a language-school talent show (really) have helped me learn more grammar than most textbooks. Man....  after I get past the bilingual stage of MCDs maybe I&#039;ll use some song lyrics. It&#039;ll make me more successful at karaoke too, and not limited to the English language stuff. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wonder if anyone could recommend to me any sources for tagalog (real, native, natural, not-sucky-learning material). I&#039;ve had trouble trying to find material for my language journey. I haven&#039;t been able to find any electronic dictionaries with example sentence and Monolingual dictionaries, for the ones that I found were pretty rubbish.

I would be eternally grateful to those willing to help a struggling language learner. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjc.ne.kr/korea/korean.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this resource&lt;/a&gt; from the SJC seemed like an interesting application of Khatz&#039;s laddering technique; and I suspected that it might be a vaguely useful way of testing your Japanese knowledge/skills - even if it doesn&#039;t quite help you learn Korean.

I&#039;m primarily interested in learning Japanese to a decent standard, and stopping there for the interim as far as additional languages are concerned - although I&#039;ve very briefly listened to some Korean music (which seemed nonsensical to me), and looked at some related resources. 

That said, like many other British students, I was forced to learn a second European language (French, in my case) during my time in secondary education (I&#039;m 20, and currently studying CS at university) - and felt it to be a fairly pointless exercise in learning a skill that I&#039;ll never use, then. I also spent several years trying to study Japanese on-and-off, in various different ways - but nothing really &quot;stuck&quot;, unless a few Kanji and Kana from song titles/artist names, and a fairly small lexicon of common words counted.

I&#039;ve forgotten most of that French knowledge, since - but I feel that I&#039;ve learned (and retained) more Japanese, after beginning a variant of AJATT, at the start of the year; and actually found practical use for that knowledge. (Mostly understanding technical blog posts, podcasts, and TV shows; and having short discussions - although I&#039;ve found myself occasionally either dropping in English words, or resorting to continuing in English, when I hit the limits of my Japanese vocabulary).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lately I&#039;ve taken to adding unknown words from song lyrics to my Anki vocab deck. I tag the words with a phrase unique to the song (e.g., &quot;UtadaHikaru_InMyRoom&quot;), which enables me to use Anki&#039;s Cram feature later to study the words specific to that song. It&#039;s working pretty well so far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s like cross-training.  You&#039;ve got to use different modalities.  If it&#039;s fun, it&#039;s a double plus.  I want to defend haiku--not that I read them--yet.  I watched &quot;My Neighbor the Yamadas&quot; with my Japanomania class and I loved the Basho haiku inserted there.  Also, I love it when Chibimarukochan&#039;s grandad busts into haiku.  Have I gone outta my way to &quot;read&quot; haiku?   Nope.  but I&#039;ve been MCD&#039;ing wikipedia articles on Zen.  But guess what, I&#039;m interested in it.  ]]></description>
