					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the constant tips and whatnot, they&#039;re very much appreciated! I have a random question about immersion and was wondering if you could offer your thoughts. I have no problem with watching and reading lots of Japanese material and doing SRS reps and whatnot... but a lot of the time, I tend to be in front of a computer or TV screen. I&#039;d rather be around that less as it can lead to headaches, sluggishness, etc. Any ideas of things to do away from the computer screens? Strictly listening to Japanese radio shows or something works, and I wish I had more books on paper (most of my reading material is online :/). Any ideas would be appreciated!]]></description>
