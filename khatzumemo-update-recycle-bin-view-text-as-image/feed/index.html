					<description><![CDATA[@Cush
It&#039;s an CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) computer text processing thing, but:
１０７ is full-width,
107 is half-width (and narrower than １０７).
I don&#039;t know exactly why the difference exist, probably in order to fit Arabic numerals and Roman text seamlessly with CJK text; full-width fits better. Having said that, half-width seems fashionable lately. Half-width is what you generally use if typing, say, English.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[With regards to the &quot;text as image,&quot; this is interesting.  Perhaps one thing you can do is set up an option to have the image show without clicking on the button to push it.  That way it&#039;s up right when the user comes to the entry.  This would be useful in the event that, say, a user is using a computer without Japanese text support (say, a certain work computer).]]></description>
