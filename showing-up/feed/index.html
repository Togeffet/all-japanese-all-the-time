					<description><![CDATA[I love this post.  When my kids were growing up and they would tell me, &quot;I can&#039;t do_____________,&quot; I&#039;d say, &quot;Have you tried it 100 times yet?&quot;  Of course, they&#039;d say no, so I&#039;d tell them to come back to me after they&#039;d tried it 100 times.  Once my son asked me, &quot;What if I try it 100 times and I still can&#039;t do it?&quot;  I said, then we do something very special...we do it 1000 times.  I came up with this when my daughter was 5 and she &quot;couldn&#039;t&quot; learn to do the grapevine step in her dance class.  Since the age of 3 she had said she wanted to be a ballet dancer when she grew up, and she was dead serious about it.  So not being able to do the grapevine step had her very upset.  I asked her if she&#039;d practiced it 100 times yet?  She said no, so she and I worked on it together, and she got it after about 10 tries.  She was also terrible at keeping a beat.  She could not for the life of her &quot;naturally&quot; clap to the beat of a song.  As you can imagine, this made dancing somewhat challenging!  So my son and I would clap to songs with her everyday.  We told her we&#039;d clap to 1000 songs if we had to.  Of course, she learned how to clap to songs.  I&#039;m sure you already know the ending to this story...she grew up to dance with a professional ballet company.  She, obviously, was not inherently talented but she did learn to work at what she wanted.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just rereading this article today to get my motivation back up for Chinese study. I already know that I can get Mandarin down, that there is nothing standing in my way, I just need to read more manga and play more games! I was surprised today to find that Age of Empries 2 on steam actually has Chinese dialogue. Now I can spam the in game commands for default chat and have my soldiers yell in Chinese. Pretty sweet. Now if only the font size was larger...

Anyway, wherever you are right now Khatz, stay cool. Like the way you&#039;ve made us all realize we&#039;re cool inside.]]></description>
