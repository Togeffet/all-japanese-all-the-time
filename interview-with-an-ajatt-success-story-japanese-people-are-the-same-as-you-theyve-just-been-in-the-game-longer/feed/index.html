					<description><![CDATA[Well done, Amir.

&quot;The most effective method that worked for me was ‘not nothing’ every day. Because if you continue every day like that you’ll be fluent eventually, [tortoise] vs hare and all of that good stuff. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&quot;

&quot;Khatz: “The most effective method that worked for me was ‘not nothing’ every day.” This is deep. “Not nothing” is a gift that keeps giving and a lesson we can’t stop learning.&quot;

&quot;People have to let go of fake perceptions.
Japanese people are the same as you, they’ve just been in the game longer.&quot;
