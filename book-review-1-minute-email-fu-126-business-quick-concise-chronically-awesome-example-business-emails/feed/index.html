					<description><![CDATA[Hey, if you&#039;re up for it, could you maybe talk some more about this #scheduling you&#039;re ranting about &#060;== over there on twitter. I&#039;ve been reading a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://calnewport.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cal Newport&#039;s Blog&lt;/a&gt; but I&#039;m interested in your opinion.

And though she was not prissy or undersexed, I do know what you mean.

She says I&#039;m &#039;basic&#039; level and I&#039;m worse than most of the people she tutors.

					<description><![CDATA[What? Praise going around and I&#039;m not getting a slice? Send some of that sweet stuff my way. (But seriously, does anybody get addicted to Japanese people on the internet praising your language skills? It can&#039;t be healthy...)

Really cool looking book. Do want! I had a series of email exchanges with a Japanese uni proff. a few months ago, and while I got by with a bit of polite+, some knowledge of honorific/humble language would have been really helpful.

Also, thanks for reminding me that I gotta get me a piece of this translating action. Two more months before my teaching job is over, and then I gotta survive somehow for four and a half months before I come to Japan. NOT doing crappy work that requires that I use only English is a dream.]]></description>

Yea I know, my Êó•Êú¨Ë™û is awesome!.......

Nowadays I try to keep everything formal in Japanese. Although, nowadays I know so much slang it isn&#039;t funny......

Those types of books I just want to use a tool to do stuff outside my computer, so I can for example read it outside when I&#039;m at school,etc,etc. Although I might as well invest in an ipod for it&#039;s large space and put a lot of japanese stuff in there instead. I like to keep my options open to everything. 


My next investments(in terms of buying are): jp games,ipod classic, more jp novels/manga, jp texts(books for teaching formal letter writing,etc) and lastly some jp dramas to go along with all that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[„Ç¢„É°„Éâ„ÄÅwell, I&#039;m sure... no, I *know* your Êó•Êú¨Ë™û is leaps and bounds above mine, but writing anything in writing, aside from email, and Êê∫Â∏Ø„É°„Éº„É´ (and youtube comments, and amazon reviews... wait..) is the Japanese excuse (no, the rule!) to use „Åæ„Åô form. And „Å™„Åã„Çç„ÅÜ„Åã„ÄÇAnd all the other stuff which is never normally used. It almost feels like... &#039;hey, if we don&#039;t use it here, we&#039;ll never use it!&#039; so it&#039;s good practice.

Now I just need to find a real job so I can put this into some practical usage :)

(speaking of electronic formats... don&#039;t get me started on the archaic ¬†Â±•Ê≠¥Êõ∏ system in place... IT companies, you know, --their life-line depending on electronic versions of everything-- demanding hand-frickin-written resumes is just... horse-deer.)]]></description>
