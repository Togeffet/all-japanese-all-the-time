					<description><![CDATA[I did this twice, and both were before I started immersing, which is really weird. But I listened to Japanese music all the time and watched Japanese-subbed shows a lot, so I guess it just got stuck in my head and my brain recycled it. In one I was talking to a Japanese girl in Japanese. It sounded like Japanese to me, at least, and I knew what I was saying (like, we were actually having a conversation) but I don&#039;t know if I was actually saying words or just making Japanese-like noises. She started to insult me and then threatened me, and I ran away as quickly as possible. That was fun.

Don&#039;t remember the second one much, but there was a lot of Japanese everywhere. I think I was in Tokyo...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Congratulations!

I do think that the key isn&#039;t necessarily listening. You simply dream of whatever keeps you busy. Your mind repeats the things you were doing or thinking about the day before, in a way, while dreaming. So, much preoccupation with Japanese of any sort could cause Japanese to become a part of your dreaming. So, after... what was it, six hours?... of listening to Japanese, it&#039;s not strange that you would dream of it.

It can be very helpful, because REM-sleep (the part of sleep in which you dream) helps solidify memories and cognitive skills in your mind. So you were effectively &quot;studying&quot; it some more while dreaming of it, so to speak!

Just wanted to share that little bit of knowledge :) but anyway, again, congratulations!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dream in English all the time, probably more often than in Dutch. Japanese... ehm well, I did dream about Dutch people who were learning Japanese, and a girl spoke about her favorite singer (being Nana Kitade) and I saw Nana Kitade&#039;s name (ÂåóÂá∫ËèúÂ•à) in kanji, while I only knew about 100 kanji or so at that time. 

And I tend to dream in &quot;Japanese&quot; when I visit Japan in my dreams, but that &quot;Japanese&quot; is the weirdest mix of English, Dutch and a few random words of Japanese. All Japanese people in my dreams understand it though ^_~ (Dreams are weird.).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ruisu: Yeah, I love At Home Dad too.  I&#039;m just Khatzumoto&#039;s wife who&#039;s far behind him in Japanese and trying to catch up.  I&#039;m too lazy to be called a co-author -- more of an on-and-off contributor.

John: That&#039;s pretty awesome you dreamed in Korean.  Multilingual dreams would be wicked!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ÊÅ≠ÂñúÊÅ≠Âñú! I remember first doing that in Chinese, and waking up so elated. Now, when I dream of Japanese friends, they tend to speak in Japanese, even though I almost always talk to them in English or Chinese in real life. A few nights ago a waitress in my dream said &quot;kamsamnida&quot; (&quot;thank you&quot; in Korean) which kind of freaked me out, because I know basically zero Korean.  I wonder if it just gets easier over time to dream in random tongues.]]></description>
