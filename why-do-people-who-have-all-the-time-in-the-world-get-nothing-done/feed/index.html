					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny you mention the law of attraction.
Do you believe in it?
Let me say to you that I&#039;ve studied a little of the law and even if I haven&#039;t had results, I think you have.
I think a lot of the advices you give, and a lot of the techniques you used to learn japanese have to do with the law of attraction.
When you say, for instance, that one should feel japanese, feel the right to be japanese, and do stuff japanese people would do, like sleeping in the floor, that makes me think a lot of the law of attraction.
I just wanted to say it to you, even if perhaps you don&#039;t belive in it, you have practiced it and applied it with succes in you life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heh, I like to think I have advantage in learning languages, as I have all day.  Thing is, I have maybe 20% more time for Japanese than those who work normal jobs do here in America.

I&#039;ve been at this for about a year, probably found out about immersion and this site at around April.  Had my ups and downs as well.

You know what shocks me?  I thought my progress was slow(I have Autism) despite the time I&#039;m putting in.  However, I go to any Japanese learning site and find out many people there aren&#039;t close to where I am, even with the same or more time put in.

It gets better too.  I see some of these people on Twitch too.  For example, I asked someone who finished watching Code Geass, and they said that Japanese was too hard and used English subtitles.  

Many people there who say they are learning hate anime too and probably spend half(or more) their time NOT doing/listening to things in Japanese.  Also, sometimes they link to learning methods that are likely VERY boring.

Point is this:  Such people think that something fun is not how you get better, when it&#039;s the only way to sustain it.]]></description>
