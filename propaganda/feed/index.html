					<description><![CDATA[khatzumoto, your blog has been so helpful. I&#039;m a junior in highschool right now, and when I graduate from college I plan to move to Japan and become a highschool teacher. I&#039;m learning Japanese right now. I didn&#039;t really know where to post this comment, so I figured I&#039;d drop it here.

I&#039;ve decided to change/bend everything in my life so that I&#039;m surrounded by Japanese culture, and language. I&#039;m really focused on learning this language. There are no excuses now, it doesn&#039;t matter if there aren&#039;t lessons avaliable anywhere, or I don&#039;t have that much money, I can do this. So thanks for the encouragement (^-^)!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sugoi! Thanks for the info. It only makes me want to go to Japan even quicker. Anyway, it&#039;s going to be tough. Well, I think this is my last comment(unfortunately, bwaaaaaa), because I got to work really hard on my immersion environment and at the same time study the hardest way possible to get the best marks(this is the only way to get to Japan as quick as possible). I&#039;ll probably go to Japan after some 3 years from now. Thanks for the blog. See you there(in Tokyo!)!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. Most people know the anime that play on normal, terrestrial TV. Anything else is the domain of supergeeks. So, everyone knows &quot;Naruto&quot;, but almost no-one knows &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; because it was only aired on premium cable. Most people in Japan don&#039;t even know (and if you tell them, will gaze at you in disbelief) that their culture has spread worldwide, and that there are kids all over the globe like you and me who were practically raised on anime.

2. Mmmm...haha...no. It&#039;s probably more to do with Japan importing food from far away, and paying high energy costs? You&#039;d probably want an economist for any more info than that :D. Anyway, fruit is more expensive here than you might be used to...

3. Pretty cool. Lots of LCDs everywhere. Lots of places where you can use digital cash (pay with your cellphone, etc.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi. I was asking myself constantly if I should thank you because I thought I would be drawing your attention to a simple &quot;thank you&quot; message. But, I decided to write it. But I don&#039;t like sending useless messages so I&#039;m posting some questions I would be glad if you answered:
1. I&#039;m a big fan of anime and I know that anime is the biggest attraction in Japan, otherwise, I have wrong information. Anyway, Khatzumoto, how is the anime reputation there in Tokyo?
2. One day, I watched a brazilian reporter(in a brazilian TV Channel) there in Tokyo say that fruits can cost really high there. Is that true? Does it have anything to do with the &quot;religion&quot; of food you where talking about?
3. Also and at last, how is technology in Tokyo? I see only small pieces of it(for example: the tiniest TV in the world) but I know or at least think that there should be much more that I&#039;m just not able to see.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;what is osmosis to you
Essentially, picking up and/or inferring words and readings  and being able to actively use them without any specific, conscious, direct or indirect effort for the word or reading in question (so, without even having SRSed it), just by being &quot;soaked&quot; in the Japanese environment. It seems like I&#039;ve picked up a lot onomatopoeia that way, and lots of slang...I think the ability to learn words this way (i.e. more or less unconsciously) may always be there, but only really blooms into direct usefulness after lots of conscious effort.

I&#039;m sure we mean the same thing? Or don&#039;t we? Do you have a different definition for it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, although there are similarities between portuguese and spanish, there are many differences that make spanish tough to read or speak even for a portuguese speaker. Besides, I&#039;m OK with the english version. Only those two words are problematic for now. Thanks for the help anyway. Huh, Khatzumoto, how did you get a job in Tokyo? I&#039;m also trying to go to Japan as quickly as possible but I&#039;m afraid I have no sustaining base there, you know, programming skills and so on. I mean, my dream is to work at Sony Corp. But is there any real hope?
Also, my native-looking english is due to a sort of unconscious immersion environment I ran into and I&#039;m still in as I have to write, read, speak, and understand english everyday(for example: windows and important textbooks that I can only find in english).]]></description>

Yeah, teachers don&#039;t generally want to hear the truth so much as they want to hear their own opinions recited back to them (no disrespect intended). Just write what the teacher wants to hear--write what the teacher believes; agree with the teacher&#039;s pet theories in your essays, even if you think it&#039;s bollocks. That worked for me gradewise.

					<description><![CDATA[Lol, I have that book, I bought it a while ago but just browsed through it, I find it rather time-consuming to go through all the processes that the book recommends. Yeah, specific points, I sort of agree with that but sometimes, even when I know the points, my bloody  Social Studies teacher doesn&#039;t accept my &quot;explanation&quot; of the points, I really dunno how to solve this problem so I&#039;m just leeching essay answers to similar questions of past-year papers and memorizing them. This is just a problem I have with Social Studies (as it is taught here in Singapore), my English essays are fine and consistently can get 25/30 or more. 

On a side note, I&#039;ve found a site with アニメの台詞集

Hmm...essay answer...interesting. 
Well, I once read somewhere (I believe it was in Adam Robinson&#039;s &quot;What Smart Students Know&quot;, a book I highly recommend), that the main problem people have with essay answers isn&#039;t knowledge or grammar, but forgetting to cover specific points. 

Also, remember that an SRS is built for small chunks of info, not large tracts. So try to break things up into small parts.

So, what I generally did with an SRS question that required an essay-like answer was simply to mention the bullet-points of my answer (my answer was the points). Filling-in can more or less wait for the real thing. For example: 
Q: Discuss the main causes of WW2?
A: Territory, boredom, apathy, resources, pride. 
Each of those answers would have its own paragraph...If more detail is needed then you might need a better question. Anyway, my point is, don&#039;t overload any single question-answer pair, you can only answer so much in one go...

&gt;do you ever memorize pure facts (etc definitions)?
Yeah, but as question. E.g. &quot;What is the name of the process whereby [blank]?&quot;]]></description>
