					<description><![CDATA[Hmm... well, the way I see it is, yes, immersion is different. You should do immersion always, but it doesn&#039;t need to be always ACTIVE immersion. In fact, I think most of it is supposed to be passive. Active immersion would be something like studying kanji or reading a book in your L2 or closely watching a movie or closely listening to a podcast. This sort of action takes energy, so it should be done in short bursts that happen often, not long stretches. Passive immersion would be to have the movie/podcast/whatever going but not really paying attention to it. This requires no or almost no energy and should be happening as often as possible. So you could be doing passive immersion while you&#039;re doing something else... napping, cleaning, exercising, homework, whatever.
Â 
So... yes, keep the immersion going, but make the active part of it small, easy things that you do often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, just to clarify, this applies to the &quot;study aspect&quot; like doing SRS reps, etc, but given any 86,400 second period one should be striving to be in a Japanized environment for as many of those seconds as humanly possible right? I guess what I&#039;m saying is, it doesn&#039;t matter how many kanji you learn a day, as long as you learn some, or how many sentence reps you do, as long as you do some, . That totally makes sense to me. But is immersion different? I know that there have been times when I was tempted to get slack about immersion, to stay in English even after things I NEEDED to do in English were finished, but because I have deeply drilled into myself this instinct to constantly maximize Japanese exposure I have been able to overcome those temptations to get sucked into the 24 Hour NCIS marathon on USA that was playing in the other room, and etc. If I&#039;d been taking a less hardcore approach, and expected less of myself in this regard, I can easily see days passing with very little time actually spent in Japanese. Basically doing a small &quot;token&quot; amount of immersion and then saying, well, as long as I do some each day that&#039;s good and then tuning into the Family Guy re-runs (When in the hell is this gonna get a Japanese dub btw?). And, I think if my immersion fell apart like that, my SRSing and whatnot would follow quickly behind it. Â Generally, slippery slope arguments are fallacies, but in this case, the pull of English is so powerful it really does create a &quot;slippery&quot; condition, I believe, and we must be on guard. Â I feel like I haven&#039;t worded this very clearly, but hopefully what I am trying to ask/address is coming through. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree, this is something I like to call being &quot;consistently persistent&quot;--you have to be like that starving pitbull that just got ahold of a nice, fresh steak: someone could pick you up and swing you around and you wouldn&#039;t let go of it.Â  Making small amounts of progress every day is more important than making a lot every now and then.Â  Don&#039;t ever do more than you can do every single day: what that means is that if you can&#039;t sustain the rate at which you&#039;re going, then slow down.

					<description><![CDATA[Again, brilliant. I always had unrealistic standards. I used to do it the typical Asian way, 600 Kanji a day (ok, thats an exaggeration, its more like 4444), but I realized that it was getting me nowhere! I would quit after day 2 only to restart 1 week later and quitting again 2 weeks later. Its like a vicious cycle which eventually gets you nowhere. This article will hopefully cure me of this detrimental habit of &quot;aiming too high&quot;. Maybe I should try &quot;aiming wider&quot;. Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very good post, I had this problem before, but luckily i&#039;m out of it.
I&#039;m all about easy goals now. I choose goals based on how I perform recently. Recently, i&#039;ve been pulling ~20 sentences a day, so i set that as my goal because i know i can do it easily. However, If i don&#039;t reach it, i&#039;m fine, i don&#039;t think much of it. 
2 days ago i only did 4 sentences, but was totally cool with it, because I know if i usually do 20 a day, 1 small dip won&#039;t hurt me at all.]]></description>
