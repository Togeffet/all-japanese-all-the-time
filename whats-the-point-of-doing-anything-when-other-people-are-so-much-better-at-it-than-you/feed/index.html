					<description><![CDATA[WHO TOUCHED MY JAPANESE??!? DON&#039;T YOU DARE TOUCH HER!!!

Seriously though, good stuff, good stuff....

Sometimes though, I just say hi to her at the mailbox, leaving her yearning for more.... because she knows she loves me, she needs me and leaves me, mind in shatters. (I don&#039;t even know what I mean here, I&#039;m sooooo wasted) 

Stay sexy Khatz, stay sexy. And black. Black&#039;s the new white. Or was it blue... not sure.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This post couldn&#039;t have come at a better time. Even though I&#039;m usually good about focusing on competing against myself, lately I&#039;ve been finding myself reaching a plateau language learning-wise and got frustrated... and started comparing myself to others who are so much &quot;better&quot; than I am. Or at least thatI&#039;m perceiving them to be that way.

This chick&#039;s gonna buck up and keep fighting~! Thanks ^^]]></description>
