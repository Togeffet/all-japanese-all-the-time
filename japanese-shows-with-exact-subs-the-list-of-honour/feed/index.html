					<description><![CDATA[There are communities of fans of various Japanese media, who make open source subtitles. You can download the subtitle files and use the VLC video player to play the video with the subtitles overlaid. I think, in general, these people are getting the video media via bit torrent. A big bonus: you can open the open source subtitle files in a text editor, so you can look up the kanjis, or copy and past the text to your SRS.

These aren&#039;t great, but they do have subs in Japanese -- and they&#039;re close to the original dialog, far as I can tell.

I like your idea, as tedious as it may be :P 
My only problem is finding the links of japanese shows without subs. My best luck is usually with spanish subs. Do you know a good site to get japanese subs or no subs at all]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto,

I found a much cheaper way to get Japanese shows with exact subs. The process for obtaining them may be a little tedious, but it saved me tons of money. So here we go:

Usually when I buy J-Dramas I buy the Chinese version because they are much much cheaper, but I was getting tired of the Chinese and English subtitles... So today I decided I wanted to buy the Japanese version of 電車男 for the original subs. However on Amazon, the lowest price for the DVD was around $150 (YesAsia was asking for a freakin&#039; $280!) So I was like, &quot;Okay, there&#039;s gotta be a cheaper way...,&quot; and sure enough there is!

Here&#039;s what I did:

1) Found the episode (in a movie file) with no subs.
2) Looked for the .idx and .sub files for that episode together.
3) Made sure VobSub was installed to my computer.
4) Placed the episode, idx file, and sub file all in the same directory.
5) Made sure that all three files named the same before the &quot;.&quot; (i.e. Densha_123.avi, Densha_123.idx, and Densha_123.sub)
6) And then I played the movie file in Windows Media Player, and I saw J-subs!

Disclaimer: I just figured this out and haven&#039;t really messed around with it too much. And also, this discovery may have been already mentioned on other posts so sorry if I&#039;m repeating them...

Anyway, I hope this helps someone, man.]]></description>

<p>1) Found the episode (in a movie file) with no subs.<br />
2) Looked for the .idx and .sub files for that episode together.<br />
3) Made sure VobSub was installed to my computer.<br />
4) Placed the episode, idx file, and sub file all in the same directory.<br />
5) Made sure that all three files named the same before the &#8220;.&#8221; (i.e. Densha_123.avi, Densha_123.idx, and Densha_123.sub)<br />
6) And then I played the movie file in Windows Media Player, and I saw J-subs!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I just figured this out and haven&#8217;t really messed around with it too much. And also, this discovery may have been already mentioned on other posts so sorry if I&#8217;m repeating them&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope this helps someone, man.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[i just want to give a supporting recommendation for ドラゴン桜. it&#039;s seriously an excellent drama. the acting may not be the best all the time, but it&#039;s definitely worth it. it&#039;s currently one of my favorite things to watch ever.

just throwing that out there.

					<description><![CDATA[I found another show with exact subs, オレンジデイズ. Also, it has a deaf main character and whenever people talk to her they speak kind of slowly because they&#039;re using sign language at the same time, which gives you more time for processing and reading the subs. 

Also, I&#039;d recommend this show to anyone who knows BSL (or other sign languages, I imagine). After a while it gets easy to pick up signs and the structures of spoken Japanese and signed Japanese (and BSL) appear to be very similar (unlike BSL/English), so with those characters who sign and talk at the same time (Kai, mostly, but he has lots of dialogue), what they&#039;re signing is usually what they&#039;re saying, as far as I could tell. I found that very helpful for picking up new vocab. 

Thanks for this amazing site, Khatzumoto!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All of the Crayon Shin-chan movies have EXACT Japanese subtitles with furigana for the kanji! (Unfortunately, the TV shows do not have ANYTHING extra on it except for the show, which I can see on regular TV!)

I also have noticed that most of the Studio Ghilbi productions do have subtitles and audio in both Japanese and English, but you go through those very quickly.  As a fan of anime, I am deeply saddened  that only few of them have Japanese subtitles.  I think they are missing out on a big market for students of Japanese...]]></description>
