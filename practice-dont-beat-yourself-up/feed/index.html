					<description><![CDATA[The problem I constantly seem to find myself running into is how exactly do I go about practicing Japanese? I&#039;ve tried finding reading material, but it usually ends up being either so easy as to be utterly useless (incredibly rudimentary, simplistic Japanese that I don&#039;t think is actually used) or incredibly difficult and indecipherable (anything above that, most of the time). I then think that the problem is that I don&#039;t know enough words, but when i go to learn words, I think that I&#039;m merely learning the answers instead of actually learning the words, which then proves itself true when I try to read a Japanese sentence and can&#039;t recognize a large number of the words. I&#039;ve also tried writing sentences, but I can never think of anything to say. I end up looking blankly at the white space with absolutely no idea of what to write before I end up doing something else altogether. Is there any way to fix any of this? I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been able to find an answer anywhere else.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[kyoushou-

I&#039;m on lesson 25 or so and I feel ya. Retention is pretty average but I noticed recently that some random kanji are slipping through the cracks. I wouldn&#039;t aim for 100% personally though. I just started using Kanji Koohi in conjunction with Surusu and I feel it&#039;s giving me an extra boost in memorizing the kanji (even though I probably beat myself up more now, because RTK only gives you keywords and I find that I can&#039;t remember the story, and therefore the kanji, unless it&#039;s given to me). 

ANYWAY: Keep going! Every bit of input counts, and eventually they&#039;ll click. Some of the kanji I thought were the most difficult have become surprisingly easy (probably because I failed them so many times...) I figure I&#039;ll have time to pick up all the scraps later.

Also one more thing: one lesson a day might get a little difficult to maintain as Heisig really starts to speed up when he drops the stories in Part 3 (lesson 23 is well over 100 kanji). I aim for 50 a day, but I usually hit 25 - 30. 

Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m not as qualified to answer this as Khatz but I have finished RTH, and he is on vacation right now and not likely to answer ;)

Yes! Keep going!
 To try for 100% each lesson will most likely lead to burn out, drilling them over and over again, the few that you miss will come to you over time by the nature of a SRS.

I also remember reading somewhere on the site, Khatz said he never tries for 100% retention or something like that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatzumoto, im doing the AJATT style + Heisig&#039;s Learning Kanji,
i&#039;ve just started 2 months ago,because i&#039;ve found your site,you really have a good point that classes suck,anyway and i&#039;m on Lesson 16 now,
i&#039;m happy with my progress and i want to have a one Lesson per day Kanji

but a Lesson takes me 1-2 days to fully grasp the assigned Kanji,
im a fresh graduate working full-time 8 hrs a day which my time is at work,
i recover my lost times by learning Kanji while travelling

is it a good idea to proceed to next Lesson even i didn&#039;t remembered 100% of the last Kanji Lesson?
can you give me an advice/ideas/examples to be much more faster?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found timeboxing to be useful for another reason.  If suddenly I have a lot of free time, or I make time, and study super hardcore and stay focused for hours, then it actually works against me because then I have less motivation to do it anything at all the next day.

					<description><![CDATA[Man, I really need to stop beating myself up. Today was a bit of a bad day for me (emotionally, physically, whatever), and because of this I didn&#039;t get into my &quot;hardcore Japanese learning mode&quot; and get my normal 30 sentences done that I like to do. But you know what? I still learned five new sentences. I still enjoyed one of my favorite Japanese shows. 

Still, man, it&#039;s hard not to beat yourself up. &#039;Cause it&#039;s like, &quot;why do you still suck at listening, huh?&quot;, &quot;Why aren&#039;t you reading more?&quot;, &quot;Why are you being lazy about looking up words?&quot;.

It&#039;s just so hard to focus on the fact that I&#039;m already light years ahead of the advanced Japanese class students. That I am, in fact, able to read Japanese with my trusty 大辞林. That with an exact subbed movie (Quiet room ni youkoso, excellent movie. I believe it&#039;s floating around the less reputable sites now) I could follow along and understand a lot.

Yeah, it&#039;s hard. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That time boxing thing is interesting. I&#039;ve tried doing that with some things, but, I always end up going over. Which, with Japanese, that&#039;s never a bad thing. I&#039;ve wanted to try time boxing each Kanji. For instance, there are times when I *over think* a story so much that it takes me off into some mysterious land of distractions. Which only results in wasted time. I do worry sometimes about &quot;Kanji burn out&quot; because I&#039;m pushing myself to get through so many, though.

I have to avoid getting frustrated when I get stuck trying to come up with a good image to fix in my head, too.]]></description>
