					<description><![CDATA[Wow.  This is really cool.  I&#039;m basically in the same position that you were in when you started, and I&#039;m hoping to achieve this level of awesomeness in Japanese by the time I&#039;m about your age... do you think you could elaborate a little on your learning process?  I would really appreciate the help.

Thanks! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is where MCDs can come in handy, it gives the best of both worlds. Find the word you want to learn in a real native sentence or paragraph and just cloze the word you want to learn. 

If you are still in the bilingual stage then you can add an English translation to the front of the card. Paper, electronic and online dictionaries are a good source of example sentences. This will teach you the English meaning naturally and help you guess the cloze. Never translate it yourself if you are at this stage, find pre-translated text or just provide the definition of the word on the back. 


Your only goal is speak aloud the clozed text. Some people suggest writing out the clozed text but personally this wasn&#039;t necessary and just killed my enthusiasm. 

Don&#039;t read the whole context text if you don&#039;t need/want to, just read enough to be able to guess the cloze deletion.

This will give you the benefits of sentence cards and the convenience of single word cards. Even though you don&#039;t have to actively recall anything from the sentences it will be benefiting you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe this isn&#039;t exactly the right place but I have a bit of a question. 

Recently I made a deck for learning vocab - basically, two cards for each item, one where I have to type out the reading from kanji and the other I had to type out the English meaning, also from kanji. But since learning words in isolation isn&#039;t exactly the best method, I switched to sentences. I still have myself type out the reading of the new word I&#039;m trying to learn, because I feel like it involves me more in the reps, but anyway- my issue is that when I&#039;m learning words in isolation it&#039;s easy to recall the readings, while in sentences I tend to have a lot of trouble remembering the readings (meanings are ok). I wonder why that is and what I could do to make it easier on myself...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awesome story Mariah!
Just be sure to not quit anymore, because that&#039;s the biggest mistake an Ajatteer can make. ;]
Keep your position and fight for your dreams, the confidence you have right now needs to be that ,which keeps you going ! (^_-)-‚òÜ It&#039;s great to hear that japanese is a part of your life now and that you&#039;re happy doing it!

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, that sounds awesome! I think I would also like to write something like Mariah in a year probably? Because the progress that I made in Korean within 6 months... I really want to show it to other people that they can see another proof that immersion is a worthy effort ^^]]></description>
