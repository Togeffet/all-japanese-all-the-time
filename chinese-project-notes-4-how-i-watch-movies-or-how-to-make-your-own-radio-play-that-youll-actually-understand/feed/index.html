					<description><![CDATA[Oh, good.  Yea, I &#039;ve actually been looping the same episode of tiger &#038; dragon at work for about 3 weeks now.  It&#039;s the one where jump tei jump(?) steals the masters story, i think o.O.  I put some music,  yomiuri podcasts and morimoeo podcasts on the ipod as well.  Thanks for the quick reply :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;Do they have grammatically correct sentences or would they just sound ‚Äúwrong‚Äù to a native speaker? 
They&#039;re perfectly fine. In some cases, you may find a *little* more pronoun use and a *little* less polite language than is usual in Japanese, but by and large it&#039;s very natural. Japan may have made shady products in the past, but now it&#039;s perhaps the wealthiest country in the world -- no trade deficit -- and along with, like, Germany, has perhaps the highest industrial quality standards in the world (someone correct me if this wrong). Also, the proud tradition of anime voice acting has made its way to dubbing, such that you have people who know what they&#039;re doing, doing the work. Not to mention that Hollywood movies make a ton of cash in Japan, so the movie-makers tend to make a point of (spending enough money to?) get quality dubbing done.

In short, Japanese dubs are made by Japanese people, for (very picky) Japanese consumers. So feel at ease.

BTW feel free to watch movies even while doing kanji...simply getting used to the sound of the language matters,too.

And congratulations on being at 1400 kanji :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just got back from the two japanese video stores around here, to see what kind of selection they had, and I&#039;m wondering if the dubbed american movies are going to sound as terrible as english dubbed ninja movies.  Do they have grammatically correct sentances or would they just sound &quot;wrong&quot; to a native speaker?  I&#039;m still only at around 1400 kanji so I won&#039;t be watching them for another couple weeks but I&#039;m just curious wether i should buy them or not.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be careful about those cool &quot;free&quot; apps made by companies with questionable motives...

Virtualdub does a good job as well... and it&#039;s safe ! Though the option is called &quot;Save WAV&quot;, it does in fact save as mp3 (with a .WAV extension, you can just change it later), provided that your divx file&#039;s audio was originally encoded as mp3. And then split it with mp3-splitter !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have the Xilisoft utility for converting between video and audio formats.

It does a great job of converting video, and of ripping the audio from a DVD.  But I haven&#039;t had much luck using it to rip the audio from a video file (such as avi or mp4).

But this does a very good job of ripping audio from video files:

http://www.erightsoft.com/S6Kg1.html


I haven&#039;t used it for anything else, but it&#039;s definitely good for audio. And it&#039;s free!

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz,

Nice summary on dissecting a movie.

I am probably the very last person in the world to &#039;discover&#039; this, but if there is anyone out there struggling to create an MPEG4 of an American/European movie for their iPod *with* only the Japanese dubbed dialogue and **Japanese subtitles**, here&#039;s how to do it:

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz,
  I&#039;m enjoying looping movies.  I&#039;ve noticed that words &quot;pop out&quot; the more I listen.  I consider that a good thing.  However, my issue is the accuracy of sentences to put into my SRS.  The subtitles don&#039;t always match and I don&#039;t always have someone to ask.  BTW thanks for the list of TV with the exact subs, that has helped.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt; So what do you do if you can‚Äôt understand exactly what is being said in the part you want to remember?
Go with the subs. Or pick out the words you think you heard in that part, and find sentences in the dictionary that use them. Whatever you do, don&#039;t go assuming. No matter what you think you heard, GET WRITTEN CONFIRMATION. Failing that, get NATIVE SPEAKER confirmation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all of the posts on your Chinese Project. I&#039;m learning Chinese as well and while I have found what you have written about learning Japanese useful, I especially appreciate Chinese-specific posts. Could you share with us some of the other Chinese material you use (music, podcasts, TV shows, etc.)? Also, do you think that Remembering the Kanji would be useful for learning Hanzi as well or is there something better?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The subtitles don&#039;t provide the exact transcript of what is being spoken I have found. So
what do you do if you can&#039;t understand exactly what is being said in the part you want to remember? Listen to it again and again?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great, thanks! One of my favourite posts of yours in recent memory. I&#039;ve saved it and shall use it! I love the movie Mean Girls but I&#039;d be worried about the possibly „ÇÆ„É£„É´„Å£„ÅΩ„ÅÑ Japanese I&#039;d pick up from it, so I&#039;ll try and find something else.

I have a Japanese phone now which plays mp3s so I&#039;ll rip the audio from a DVD and I shall loop as you say!]]></description>
