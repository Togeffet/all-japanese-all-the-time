					<description><![CDATA[So I thought of something...

A baby has absolutely nothing to support itself, just a mind, eyes, and ears.
We have what babies have, and a sophisticated understanding of the world. There&#039;s no need to force ourselves into a monolingual environment where don&#039;t understand anything.

The only thing we need to learn from kids is their ability to zone in on something and have fun doing it. We need to stop worrying, and start enjoying learning.

					<description><![CDATA[I have already gone Monolingual, And I&#039;d like to share some experiences. 
Yes, At it may have been to some of you, it was intimidating to me at first.
I first tried around 500 sentences. Bad idea, I must have over estimated my ability, look ups took too long. Not that I was too lazy, but I think 8 look ups is just a tad bit high.
Then around 1200, I fully made the switch, and have not used english since.
What I did/do is i get a lot of sentences. So If i need to make too many lookups (4+) I just skip it, I&#039;m not ready yet. Luckily, since I get so many, I can skip a decent amount and still finish with a nice amount of sentences.
It&#039;s great for thinking in Japanese. When I see 立ち入り, I don&#039;t think whatever it means in english, I think of ある場所に入ること. Great for starting to think in Japanese!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So after spending tons and tons of hard-earned お金 on Japanese movies, music, books, etc...I found that I still sucked.  Having Japanese stuff didn&#039;t instill within me a sense of permanent motivation OR even a decent level of Japanese.    I had almost given up, thinking that all of the racist bull-honky about Asian languages was true.  In all of that time I had not listened to Japanese without subtitles, or even watched the news.  Why didn&#039;t I?  I thought subtitles would help a guy out.  Nope.  Don&#039;t believe the prevailing opinion of anime nerds everywhere.  English subtitles make you better at English, not Japanese.  All of my オタく friends say &quot;kawaii&quot; and &quot;neh&quot;, but speak no Japanese...

I found this website after trying every hair-brained thing that people suggested to me (because, ya know, thinking for yourself really sucks). Yeah, I found it but I still worked too hard at Japanese.  I punished myself into doing Heisig 1 in about a month while immersing. When I completed that last card...The train stopped, or exploded, or something...anyway I HATED Japanese at that point and could not bring myself to do any no matter how hard I tried.  I gave up learning Japanese to pursue a career in songwriting (I&#039;m not kidding) for about 6 months, forgetting almost all of my kanji and much of everything else...After that side-quest I came back and decided to do the Japanese thing sanely (Cause I missed my baby and I was sorry &#039;dat we fought)...and its been real smooth, easy, fun...until I had to go monolingual.  I had the dictionaries and everything, but could not bring myself to learn without the taint of English on the back of my SRS cards.  

I don&#039;t know how many times I read the monolingual posts here and elsewhere in the interwebs, but I couldn&#039;t understand how to do it.  It didn&#039;t work.  I looked up words I knew-no good the definitions were gibberish (granted, gibberish that I recognized as writing O:) ).  I tried to use the sentences from the QRG-no good.  Even those were out of my league.  I was getting all down on myself and considering quitting again or never going monolingual, when I had an interesting idea.  I read through my dictionary, ignoring key words, until I got to a definition sentence that I aaallmost understood (one word missing).  

Here is that first card:
Front: 
よく晴れた空のような色。(I took this from the definition of the word blue)

Back: 
青［あお］(the place where I got it-i knew this word so I figured it would help me out with the meaning of the sentence)

晴れ［はれ］。天気［てんき］がよいこと。(I google imaged this mother, but it didn&#039;t help so I looked it up in my monoDICT and googled words from THAT definition until I understood this one.)

空［そら］。天［てん］(I knew this word so I put a synonym in instead of a mile long sentence)

色［いろ］。赤。青。(I like this definition straight from the dictionary-This simple brevity is one reason that I love Japanese)

This had me bouncing around the dictionary and I can honestly say its a thrill.  I am having a blast knowing that I understand this card in Japanese.  The advantage of starting with simple DEFINITIONS is that they come in sentence/phrase form and you don&#039;t have the problem of looking at a word like 青 on the front of the card and saying: &quot;yeah, blue-faiyke! that&#039;s not the Japanese definition at all!&quot; I made a rule for myself: If I can&#039;t comprehend the sentence upon researching it in Japanese only, it is not what Khatzumoto calls &quot;A low hanging fruit.&quot;  

I am very excited!  When I get excited I do crazy things like tossing away all of my old sentence decks...This time I will not.  I will let those J-E cards continue until I&#039;m bored with them.  Now that I have a monolingual deck, though, my criterion for deletion in my J-E has just gotten much, much stricter.  

Moral of my story on this AJATT journey: As an individual I have to take responsibility for my learning.  If I can see the goal as a mountain in the distance, it is nobody else&#039;s fault that I don&#039;t take the necessary steps toward the mountain.  Maybe I walk with a limp, or don&#039;t own a car, so I can&#039;t get to the mountain the same way Khatzumoto did, but as a creative individual I will find my own way to that mountain even if I have to commit metaphorical grand theft auto to make it happen...Has this metaphor spun out?  I think so.

Be Creative. Be you. Succeed on your own terms. WHOO.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[cool thing that you put this little article up because it was basically the first way I started experimenting with japanese-only dictionaries. I would just look up words I already know and after a while you realize that the dictionaries, like english ones, have the same grammatical syntax and same words used over and over again to describe things and so far, using a japanese-only dictionary isn&#039;t a problem at all. After a while, it just all builds up until you pretty much know like 80% of the words that the dictionary uses to describe new words....it&#039;s like a big long endless circle of getting smarter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t usually use the definitions because they can be a little boring, except one case: when they&#039;re descriptions of a specific object/thing.
I&#039;ve created a &quot;Quiz&quot; tag in anki, and when I find a word I want to learn and of which I don&#039;t have a good sentence, I put the definition in the Question Side, and the word in the Answer Side. For example:

Q: 種から芽が出たばかりの植物：？
A: 苗（なえ）

Q: 水が浅くて泥が深く、自然にできた池：？
A: 沼（ぬま）

Q: き の かん や えだ の さき：？
A: 木の幹や枝の先：梢（こずえ）

Of course one can do it both kanji&#062;reading and the other way around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a good idea, especially with simple nouns. Also this might be a no brainer for most but it took me a while to figure out: give definitions their own entries! A lot of vocab gets repeated in dictionary entries. Also they&#039;re a nice length, so this definition from the デジタル大辞泉

【使い分け】場合に応じて使い方・使う物などを区別すること。

yields two entries:

【使い分け】場合に応じて使い方
【使い分け】使う物などを区別すること

A nice side effect is you learn the word in question really well.]]></description>
