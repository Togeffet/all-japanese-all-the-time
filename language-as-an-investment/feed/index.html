					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, did you catch this? Charlie Brooker (British media commentator) was giving an interview to a games magazine and he made an absolutely superb analogy despite the unlikelihood of him being inducted into the Motokhatzu Method:

CB: Do you find you sort of have an attitude where you say “stick with it, it’s good for you”?

MCV: It’s all you can do.

CB: You’ll pass through that wall of understanding, honest! It’s like learning a language. We’ve done it. We’ve played games for years. We know the shorthand.

[...]

MCV: I’m guessing by the fact that you chose to dedicate so much of Gameswipe to help people understand that means that this lack of understanding and these barriers is something that frustrates you?

CB: Yes. I don’t know the way round it, exactly. It’s a quandary and one for games developers as a whole. The closest analogy really is that it’s like we’ve learnt a language. Gamers are people who’ve learnt Esperanto. There are these brilliant films being released in Esperanto and to try and introduce a non-Esperanto speaker to them is frustrating because they’re going to give up. They don’t understand it. It doesn’t mean they’re stupid and it doesn’t mean they’re bad at games. They just haven’t put in the ground work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Decent article Khatz.

I was hoping you would touch on some of the types of work available to bilinguals. That&#039;s of course assuming that you have experience with these kinds of jobs.

Also, it would be great if you went into detail about all of the types of benefits that one could gain AFTER one has become natively bilingual. I would say that your style of writing would make such an article very interesting to read.

On what you have written here already, I think you are trying to say that &quot;there are great financial benefits waiting once you get there, but you have to motivate yourself through all of the tough work by making it fun / convincing yourself that it is fun.&quot;  Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.

					<description><![CDATA[I never really thought about learning Japanese for economically reasons at all.  Now that I think about it&#039;s kind of interesting that people do it for that.  It&#039;s fun and I will continue to do it because it&#039;s fun.  Also here&#039;s a tip for people who on those days that feel like your not learning anything go back to Japanese videos that made you made want to learn Japanese.  That passion it gave you no matter what it is.  If you&#039;ve been doing this immersion thing long enough you&#039;ll be impress by what you learn.  Yes by giving up English I&#039;ve given up on my identity now.  I also miss those English things I did.  I still have to keep going though.  I believe I will eventually make my own identity piece by piece as I go on.  I really don&#039;t think that people that learn it for economic reasons are going to be doing this immersion thingy for 2 years straight.  You need to have that strong passion even if you do have your dreams.  Money as your passion is very bad for learning a language.  It should be to have fun and as Khatz said do it because it&#039;s there.  English used to be my only passion back then.  I just replaced it with Japanese just this month.

So all in all learn a language because it&#039;s fun.  Who knows you&#039;ll have so much fun that you&#039;ll eventually forget about becoming fluent and just enjoy the path.  Or at least that&#039;s my story.  I&#039;ve forgot about doing Japanese hardcore a year ago when I first stumbled a cross this site.  English was my passion, my life, and my desire.  Now I started my Japanese project meaning that any desired English I would block from my head.  

So make more posts Khatz and keep spreading that knowlege through people&#039;s head.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope you all realize how absurdly WRONG your comments about learning a language ONLY for economic purposes are — that is, unless you specifically limit the statement to Westerners of a certain mindset. 1/6th of the world population — Mainland China — learns English ONLY for economic reasons (well maybe for face too)(okay there is of course the odd exception here and there, but their lack of interest in anything but parts of the language that will get them more money -- e.g. not slang, movies, entertaining things, casual speech forms, betrays what is going on and makes it obvious to anyone who has worked in a Chinese office more than a few years (ME)). 

Symptoms of people who learned a language for the money, and why I hate talking to them:
(1) Zero interest in the culture. They expect to address me in MY language and for ME to adapt to the offensive things that end up coming out of their mouths due to their lack of knowledge 
(2) Disgusting accents — with the response to any critique &quot;if you can understand me, it&#039;s enough&quot;, nevermind the strain and mind-numbing request for repeats required for me to get that &quot;understanding&quot;, these wankers give all the burden of the work in understanding to the listener
(3) (Some people...) Speaking so fast that they trip constantly over their own words and such that I have to strain really hard to understand — they are trying to show-off to their peers and &quot;gain face&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate economy (ever heard of The Venus Project?) so I&#039;m going to comment on the &quot;fun&quot; part. I was (probably???) a fool some weeks ago when I started beating myself with the &quot;Why am I not having progress?&quot; thing. The strange thing is that I APPEARED to be having fun so I had no reason think like that. HOWEVER, reality showed itself when I got some REAL FUN STUFF. What Khatz said is surprisingly effective: &quot;one is only going to go through with the language if one gets lost in the language.&quot; So it&#039;s not just apparent fun, it means to REEEAAAALLLLLYYYYY GET LOOOOOOOOOOST! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Despite my incoherent, rambling comment yesterday, I&#039;m going to risk making a fool of myself again.  I have always learned languages because I LOVE them, and at the end of the day you can only learn if you fall in love.  With the language, though a person who speaks it will also do if you can manage it. ;)  I&#039;m a language butterfly, but it&#039;s only because its my favorite pastime.  I ditched my near-native French for Mandarin fifteen  years ago after I lived in France and found it wasn&#039;t for me.  But now Chinese is hot...you know, which is nice.  But the Russian linguists are out of a job now.  So who&#039;s to say I won&#039;t be out of a job in ten years when Tagalog is the next big thing?   I love Mandarin, so I&#039;ll always do that.  But I&#039;m also a language whore, and nothing will stop me from learning more.  

Because with each language, I learn something new about humanity and about myself.  I learned to be polite and clever in French, and how to be frank but not rude in German, and how to be empathetic and pleasant in Mandarin.  The values of these cultures rubbed off onto me, and I absorbed the best of them.   It&#039;s a beautiful thing, and a lot of this cultural understanding can only come through how the language conceptualizes the world.  So being a polyglot is a philosophical journey as well as a selfish one.

But I really really want to thank Khaz for demistifying language learning, so that being bilingual isn&#039;t seen as an elite activity.  We&#039;re just people who spend our resources differently.  And like Khaz says, at the end of the day it&#039;s the person with real world skills who&#039;s going to succeed, not the language monkeys who don&#039;t anything except small talk.  You need something to talk *about* in the language, too.

Just--right on, Khaz!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz isn&#039;t assuming too much things, he&#039;s just speaking the truth about this subject. My major is Spanish and luckily my class is filled with passionate people rather than some persons that learn Spanish because it&#039;s good for their wallet. Heck, in The Netherlands learning Spanish is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; good for your wallet because there&#039;re few opportunities to use it in an economical way. I don&#039;t care, Spanish is my passion.

In the U.S. on the other hand there&#039;s some craze going on to learn Spanish. Sure, there are quite some latin people in the U.S., but is that your main reason to learn Spanish? To fill your wallet? Same goes for Mainland Chinese learning Japanese or Cantonese people learning Mandarin; just to secure a bright future.

But most fail because their motivation is based on something they don&#039;t fully support. We all want to have a bright future, but learning a language to achieve that is a bad beginning. Like Khatz says; you need to input such a ridiculous amount of time that if you&#039;re not really motived you&#039;re just aiming to fail.

Language learning should be a selfish thing, yes, but not to get rich. You only have to learn it because you &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; want to do it &lt;b&gt;yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Other than that there&#039;re no real reason.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m dealing with my fare share of day-trader pressure right now; when I explain that I am learning Japanese the typical first response is that I should be learning Chinese- &quot;where the money is!&quot; It&#039;s nothing new though; I studied Latin in college and received an equal amount of criticism for studying a &quot;dead language&quot; (I hate that term). But what keeps me motivated is not thinking of languages as means to an end, but as ends in themselves. A more geographic metaphor: I don&#039;t think of language learning as a hike towards some sort of destination beyond the horizon; rather, I&#039;m already at the destination, and it&#039;s a freakin playground! My only job is to explore and play in the environment in which I find myself. The naysayers can go suck eggs while I build sand castles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am French, and I do business studies, so I am used to hearing that kind of things about &quot;learning languages for business reasons&quot;. Yes, speaking a language like Mandarin or Japanese is an asset in your career. But learning a language for business reasons only is impossible. The only thing that make you hold on is the culture. Looking to all these new episodes of How I Met Your Mother I&#039;m gonna watch, and how I will progress thanks to them in learning English. Learning Japanese by watching 茶の味 in Japanese, understanding one or two words a sentence. Thinking that I just know the most famous aspects of Japanese Culture, and that a whole world is waiting for me to be discovered if I keep on.


I started Japanese for business reasons. I hold on for mangas-video games-Murakami books-Kitano films reasons.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel perhaps you are assuming too much Khatz. For instance I am learning Mandarin, it is an investment in my eyes. But not solely from some financial point of view, from the point of view that I get to experience China from an inside perspective as it develops further. I am very curious what kind of changes will take place Politically, Economically, and Scientifically within China(after all they&#039;re going to beat the American back to the moon). Perhaps we are both more on the same page since perhaps I am quite enjoying Chinese as something I do, but my initial decision on Chinese was that there might be some sort of economic benefit **ON TOP OF THE BENEFIT OF JUST LEARNING ANOTHER LANGUAGE&quot;. I don&#039;t think most of these people solely chose their languages on the basis of economic investment, they&#039;re human beings the same as both of us and anyone who seriously studies a language day in and day out in my opinion has to have some passion for it at that moment, and I suspect those people do.  Perhaps you are referring to 3 day monks? or rather, relatively speaking, they won&#039;t stick out long.  In that case... why bother on an article to them. Why not rather an article to encourage those who are in for the long haul.

To me this series feels misplaced and lacks your usual polish. After all you&#039;re more guilty of 500 languages at once than most people here.(I(In reference to previous language studies prior to AJATT.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Just as acting native-like is both the cause and effect of…becoming native-like, so learning a language must become an end in itself.&quot;

This is, I feel, the key point of the article, and one that it&#039;s taken me years (decades?) to learn.  You could print this in 2-inch-high letters and it would still be too small.

For years, I&#039;ve had jobs for which shipping the final product -- the last 2% -- was the satisfying part.  (For some reason I thought that was the right idea.)  Then I discovered something completely different for which the hard work that takes the first 98% of the time is the really satisfying part.

You might suspect the difference is only one of degree, but it&#039;s such a huge difference that it leaks over from a quantitative difference into a qualitative difference.  If I&#039;m practicing *all the time*, I get better much faster, which makes it even more fun, which means I want to practice more, which ...

You have to love the &quot;putting hard work in&quot; part of what you&#039;re doing, not just the &quot;getting results out&quot;.  Nobody loves anything enough to put in work they hate doing for a long time, just to get some results out years in the future.  You will never stay motivated that long.  You can bet Michael Jordan practices 27 hours a day because he loves shooting hoops, not because he wanted to wear a championship ring.  That&#039;s why I think AJATT might actually work: the Prime Directive seems to be something like &quot;do whatever it takes to keep it fun&quot;.

(And no, my activity B isn&#039;t &quot;speaking Japanese&quot;, but it&#039;s related, so that helps.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel compelled to remark on here that language knowledge is absolutely not valued financially as much as it should be in western society. Perhaps this is because some are fortunate enough to grow up surrounded by multiple languages, or in a country where English is a foreign language so learn both their own mother tongue and English from a young age. 

But whatever it is, the next time I see some industry leader or head of the CBI caterwauling that our school leavers do not have adequate language skills I sill be screaming at the TV that they probably would if they saw that language ability actually paid in any quantifiable terms.

Yes, learn languages because you love them, because you love the process, or because you are some kind of masochist! But for goodness sake never forget the hard work you&#039;ve invested in them when someone offers you a job that relies upon them for minimum wage + £1 an hour.
