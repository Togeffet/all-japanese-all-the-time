					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, hello!

I have a painfully obvious question. It&#039;s more painful then typing two or three letters, forming a positive or negative affirmation. It&#039;s so painful, one may want to scream *and* excrete a noun of the same matter upon hearing it.

So, the painfully obvious question is; when getting input, do you try to translate it? 

To expand further on that, do you a) actively try to translate to understand, b) passively listen, expecting that with repetition your brain will get it, or c) do both? [..or d) do you go Super Saiyan and simply expect Japanese to learn you? :P]

I&#039;ve recently discovered your website and absolutely love it! But there&#039;s a strange mist in the air of how to go about AJATT-ing. You&#039;ve dropped hints here and there, but never came right out and answered the question straight up. I think answering that painfully obvious question will explain everything. 

...Well, it won&#039;t explain whether there is an end to the Universe, what&#039;s inside black holes, and if there is an almighty being controlling everything, but it&#039;ll get us one step closer! :)
