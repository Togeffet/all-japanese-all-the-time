					<description><![CDATA[In my haste to get all my thoughts down I forgot to ask the other questions. Do you think it is frivolous of me to think that this method will work, considering that the time I have available to listen to/srs/study people actually speaking Mandarin is so limited compared to most? I&#039;m thinking that the thing that will make the most difference for me at this stage is to play games in mandarin... and at least listen to movies while I eat lunch and dinner.. or drive in my car. As a DJ and a producer I live an extremely hectic lifestyle... that is just going to get more hectic... but Mandarin is one of my main passions and has consistently been so for about a year now. (I am currently planning a tour in mainland china) I am hoping that this will give me a major boost in both inspiration and listening/speaking skill! Anyways, any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks again.

&gt;I was wondering if you know where to find an entire transcript to this Mandarin version of Star Trek?
Negatory. But I have a possible solution for you: try googling longish/unique dialogue snippets...might turn up something. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto,

First off I should probably thank you for all the limitless inspiration you have given me over the last 3 months or so. I have been learning mandarin for about 10 months now and the times in which I follow your advice is when I make the most progress. I just discovered your post about using monolingual dictionaries today and I am definitely going to make the switch. I think that is what I am missing... having to translate in my head slows me down way to much and it is a bad habit. 

I am posting on this blog post because I was wondering if you know where to find an entire transcript to this Mandarin version of Star Trek? I&#039;ve been watching it repeatedly and understanding more and more every time. However, I am currently in a mandarin class.. using the &quot;Integrated Chinese&quot; textbooks... and while I enjoy the class most of the time... the other students just don&#039;t have the motivation that I do. Or at least they are perhaps too busy to put the work in that is necessary to truly move forward. Recently I have been going chapters ahead and am able to learn the new vocabulary very fast.. without doing the workbook work. Would you recommend that I stay in this class but focus more on using SRS and watching films? I have been getting ahead in class on purpose so that I can start focusing more on ajatt method. 

Also, some other questions. Using the Ajatt method is sometimes difficult for me because I am a music producer and an audio engineer. I can&#039;t spend as much time listening to mandarin audio as I would like to... due to my chosen profession. It was hard at first not to listen to the music and english audiobooks that I normally listen to while driving.. but I am making the transition and have already seen a HUGE improvement just from exposing myself to mandarin a few hours a day. (I find that I gain more from listening to mandarin for an hour and doing an hour of homework.. then doing 2 hours of homework) I am also looking into finding mandarin audiobooks. I started using amazon.cn to buy mandarin movies and it has been a great experience. Just making it to checkout reading only characters was quite a challenge! I am currently saving up for Windows 7 Ultimate, simply because you can have the mandarin version of the operating system installed simultaneously and you can switch between them. After this I play on installing 天下2 (an online mmorpg) so that I will be forced to converse with people using only characters. (If i&#039;m going to play video games anyway, I might as well gain something. 

I apologize for this long... unorganized message. It is a culmination of several months of wanting to respond to posts on here. I thank you very much for this amazing blog and all of the useful information you provide. You are redefining what it means to learn a language. Never doubt yourself. You are a true guru of language acquisition. 

Cheers,
Ray Mack]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The intro from the original series in Japanese:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4YIyLxpQik

Q:
宇宙、それは人類に残された最後の開拓地である
A:
宇宙[うちゅう]、それは 人類[じんるい]に 残[のこ]された 最後[さいご]の 開拓[かいたく] 地[ち]である

かいたく 【開拓】
・ (2)新しい分野や領域、あるいは人の進路や人生・能力などを切り開くこと。

I remember looking this one up a while back because m-flo makes reference to it in on of their songs. ;) &#060;3 m-flo

which reminds me, the Japanese title of the original star trek was 宇宙大作戦/uchu dai sakusen, just like another classic from the same era, スパイ大作戦/supai dai sakusen, or Mission Impossible, of which was just recently released on DVD in Japanese. 

Have a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3FyHUbGu9M&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here,&lt;/a&gt;
