					<description><![CDATA[ok I tried it with a small number, 5 sentences per day for a month and I did not like the results. It worked, like I could read the sentences but every sentences felt fuzzy, almost like a guess at all times. Like &quot; uh I think the character is this and that character is that so that would make the word this, am I right, ah yes I am right&quot; 
At first I enjoyed the idea of being able to read full sentences within the first week, but after a while it just didn&#039;t feel real enough. It felt like I was cheating myself out of a lot of that firm grasp I could have on each Hanzi if I learned them with RTH or something first. So it just didn&#039;t feel worth it for me to continue that method.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A Japanese tree fort? That sounds so much better than German homework! I started learning German when I was about two. My parents wanted to make me bilingual, but it didn&#039;t work. I then took German for about 10 years when I was at school. Now that I&#039;m in college, I hoped that I&#039;d get to pick what I want to study, but apparently that&#039;s not the case. I mean, I&#039;m already majoring in English, for God&#039;s sake!
I guess that studying Japanese on my own may be a good solution. At least I&#039;d get to have my very own tree fort. :p
You&#039;ve given me a lot to think about. Thanks! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(continued from that conversation... the reply box was getting too narrow for my liking :P)

&#062;Right now, Iâ€™m trying to cram some German vocabulary right before I go to college in September, and Iâ€™m suffering a lot.
I&#039;m not sure where you&#039;re from, but I&#039;m Canadian, and as you may know, Canada has two national languages: English and French. Now, I&#039;m from English Canada, so for the first 9 grades of school, I had to take French class. (It was optional from grade 10 and onwards.) 
Â 
Both French and Quebec are beautiful, but I never really intended on learning the language. So, I spent 9 years becoming very talented at the art of Just-Getting-By. I have to wonder if maybe you could benefit from just doing what you can with German, and accept it as something on the fringe of your chores. 
Â 
If it&#039;s making you suffer, you&#039;ll end up performing poorly in the subjects that you are brilliant in (and I&#039;m sure that is many!) as well as just causing yourself too much stress. You don&#039;t have to excel in German, you just need to do well enough to garner a passing grade, and if there&#039;s an issue of having to own up to a shaky mark (be it to your parents or to yourself), just tell them/yourself that by the end of the year, all that really would have mattered was getting the credit, nothing more.Â 
Â 
Also, I don&#039;t think you really need to wait until your German commitments are over to start Japanese. I mean, Japanese is like a playhouse to me. I get to go inside, leave the outside world behind, and play with my toys. Anime, kanji, music, chopsticks; they&#039;re all here just for play and nothing more. Hey, you could one-up me and build a Japanese tree fort (and have a sign on the front saying, &quot;No German [language] allowed!&quot;):D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, thanks a lot for this post. You *are* extremely impressive :p (sorry!)
I think I&#039;m scared of studying Japanese because I took Chinese when I was a first-year college student and I completely flunked the final exam.
The teacher was a native speaker but she sucked. Like, she expected us to know a lot of things that she didn&#039;t even teach us. It&#039;s a shame because I was interested in learning Chinese.
Now, I&#039;m stuck re-taking a language I hateâ€”Germanâ€”because of a stupid teacher. Oh well. I mean, I know Japanese is easier than Chinese, and I would have chosen Japanese if it had been available, but I didn&#039;t have that option at the time.
Don&#039;t even get me started on how idiotic the college board is for making us study another foreign language. I&#039;m already majoring in English, I think it&#039;s enough!
Right now, I&#039;m trying to cram some German vocabulary right before I go to college in September, and I&#039;m suffering a lot.
I think studying German for a few months is just what I need to realize how much better Japanese would be.

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Your dedication is impressive. Seriously, learning most kanji in 3 months must have been pretty hard.
Thanks for your kind words, but I have to admit, it wasn&#039;t that impressive... I think I&#039;m starting to understand how Khatz feels when others say that he must be extremely smart. Like, there were *weeks* when I didn&#039;t bother cracking the book open. There were also weeks where I&#039;d only learn 10 new kanji a day. 
Â 
Like, let&#039;s use last Saturday as an example. I spend about 2 minutes on each new kanji. That means that last Saturday, I spent 20 minutes studying. Now, let&#039;s calculate my free time. Say I spent 10 hours sleeping (hey, I like to sleep!), 1 hour on hygienic things, 1 hour eating, and 2 hours on various chores; that means I had 10 hours of free time. 
Â 
Last Saturday, I spent 20 minutes of my free time on kanji. That&#039;s 1/30th of my free time! There&#039;s no dedication or determination in that. I probably spent more time on *The John* than I did learning new kanji! 
Â 
Although I don&#039;t know much about you, Miss Language Learning, it sounds like you&#039;ve already become fluent in multiple languages. You already know - and definitely more than I do - what it takes to learn a language, and you probably don&#039;t need to hear my rant about how anyone can easily learn the kanji. It&#039;s just that I think so many people are immobilized when they think about learning thousands of kanji, and I just think it&#039;s helpful for them to hear that it&#039;s not as hard as they might think.Â 
Â 
&#062;I canâ€™t bring myself to study English vocabulary. Like, not even a couple of cards a day. Then again, I do a lot of stuff on the side.
Yesterday, I was thinking about all the abandoned decks in my SRS. They were all failures. But then again, it appears that the sum of those failures has grown into something quite immense :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, the first 500 kanji took me an embarrassingly long time to do (so long that I&#039;m not going to tell! :P) But that was just because I sucked, not because they were extra hard or anything. The remaining 1542 took me from mid May till now - roughly three months.Â 
Â 
My pace varied. Some weeks, I&#039;d do 25 a day, some only 10, and a couple weeks, I didn&#039;t do any. But that was okay, I got here eventually. I&#039;m sure you (and many others) can do way better than me. I bet it would also be great for studying English, seeing how the key words to the kanji are given in English. (In fact, I learned some new English words, and my native tongue is English! eg &quot;promontory&quot;. Never heard that word before!)
Â 
Good luck to you if you decide to try it! :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keep in mind that Heisig doesn&#039;t take the SRS into account when touching on how strong your long-term retention will be.

The Lazy Kanji model really fits if you&#039;re going the AJATT route. Using vanilla Heisig, you&#039;ll be stuck with weak Kanji recognition, but strong production abilities in the beginning. Using Lazy Kanji, your recognition will be better than your production for a while. This helps because even though you won&#039;t be able to &quot;read&quot; the Japanese in your immersion environment, you&#039;ll easily be able to pick out Kanji and recall their meaning/keyword - this further strengthens your retention.

All of that said, they both balance out in terms of recognition and production in the end, and you wind up in the same state either way: you&#039;ll forget the keyword eventually(replaced by proper understanding once you learn the multiple connotations of the Kanji, and their readings) but you remember the stroke order. I listened to an interview with James Heisig himself and even he doesn&#039;t remember a single story he used.

Anyway, that&#039;s my 2 cents - take from it what you will. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Lazy&quot; and easy is a great idea. You&#039;ll feel encouraged to do reps.
I find this dangerous because heisig says it&#039;s bad. He emphasizes the malignancy of this method; he states that Kanji ----&#062; Keyword hampers retention.

I don&#039;t feel like doubting the almighty Heisig.

However, what I took from this is that &quot;easy&quot; = fast and fun. 

This is just the same old method, but faster because it only gives the elements.

FRONT:
suspend;  hang;  10%;  install;  depend;  consult

PREFECTURE, DNA, HEART

BACK:

It takes less than a minute to make a card.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just started RTK.. Am almost 100 kanji in now. I&#039;ve been using 2 different decks, doing the original heisig way AND the lazy mod at the same time. I figure it doesn&#039;t hurt to do both. But both use only the keyword and not dictionary definitions. I wonder if I&#039;m missing out by using only the keyword? Like.. the whole point of doing this method without learning the readings along with it is to learn the MEANING of the kanji, correct? But don&#039;t we miss out some of the meaning by not learning all the &quot;faces&quot; of a given kanji? Is there a benefit of sticking to just one keyword? Are the keywords close enough to the real/main meaning of the kanji that we can easily pick up the rest when we start sentances?

And a second, more unrelated question.. When you start reading books/manga/whatever.. Do you look up every single word you don&#039;t understand? (which at the start, is pretty much everything!) Seems like a very heavy/boring way to read..  How does one approach this?

Would really appreciate some help ^^
Thank you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hey guys,

So I&#039;m learning the Kanji from the book RTK as suggested, and I got the Lazy Mod thanks to Kendo, and it&#039;s just for me right now, more enjoyable and fun then doing it with the keyword phrase version first.

Basically, what I&#039;m currently doing is learning the Kanji in order from Remembering the Kanji book on the bus, subway, and stuff, and then going home and using the lazy kanji method to practice my writing and I guess remembering it.

I find that it&#039;s more fun, cuz I remember when I did it the other way like on Kanji Koohi, I always felt like kinda of stupid for not remembering it... I kinda of berated my self.

But with the lazy method, I feel that even If I don&#039;t remember what it meant, I still kinda of practiced by writing it out...

So lets see what happens in a few months...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As you can see from the date of my last post on this thread, my attempt to do Lazy Kanji started over a month ago.  In that time I went through 300 Kanji using that method.  I attribute my &quot;slowness&quot; from having to get my SRS back to a normal situation since I was inputting the Kanji I already knew and the related stories in bulk.  

Sadly, Lazy Kanji has not worked for me.  I can see how this could totally work after learning primitives, but if you were to show me the primitive of &quot;sow&quot; or &quot;fingers,&quot; I could identify them, but ask me to write them and I cannot.  Also my overall retention was horrible.  

Maybe down the road Lazy Kanji would be more appropriate, but for my initial learning, it is not working for me.

I discovered a few &quot;tricks&quot; while doing this though, such as putting the sentence directly on the front of the SRS card, but using white text, therefore making it &quot;invisible,&quot; but available if need be by selecting the text.  

If I got anything out of this attempt though, is that my frustration of doing Kanji this way has led me to try timeboxing, and I love it.  I use it for everything now.

Last nite I began my process to get back into &quot;regular&quot; Heisig learning.  I blew through 350 cards like it was nothing.  Of course I already knew them (well, 91% of them it turns out) so that&#039;s not going to be a daily average when I get into new characters, but timeboxing absolutely helped me get through it.  It got to the point where I would be doing my ten minutes of &quot;fun&quot; and I would keep glancing over at the timer, excited to get back to the Kanji, but I didn&#039;t jump back before the ten minutes was up because I knew I would get burnt out.  

So yeah, the lazy method didn&#039;t work for me, but I could see how would for some people.  Oh well, onward to the end of RTK!]]></description>
