					<description><![CDATA[Hi ! I&#039;m just about to start studying Business&#038;Management and Japanese studies at university and, although I&#039;m a bit biased, I don&#039;t think that studying Japanese in a classroom is so useless. I&#039;ve learnt Chinese this way, sitting in a classroom, although in China, for a year. My level is somewhere between HSK 5 and 6 now, which is pretty good I think. I intend to do the same with Japanese. I love going to class, I love to listen to teachers who know what they are talking about, it&#039;s an environment that stimulates me. I&#039;m looking forward to studying Japanese at university, especially since I&#039;m not going to just study the language, but I will also have classes about Japanese History, literature, culture.. taught by renowned experts (it&#039;s so much better to read a book when you know its author!). I also have a compulsory year in Japan as part of my degree, which I&#039;m sure will be super beneficial language-wise but also awesome to make business contacts and such. That&#039;s another great opportunity I will have thanks to my Japanese major. Now I completely agree that not all Japanese studies graduates are fluent in Japanese and that&#039;s sad, but since we are given many great tools to do so, and with passion, I know for sure that many are indeed fluent. Starting with my own brother..
I discovered this website yesterday and I&#039;m looking forward to learn more. Cheers!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m actually doing this now. Since I have already watched several hundred hours of amine subbed before starting the ajatt method, I decided it would be a good idea to rewatch my favs sans subs and also rip the audio from the eps to listen to from my iPod. I actually really like having some kind of idea, from previous viewings, of whats going on. Also, an unlikely source for this is crunchy roll. I generally watch random amine, and since the site has soft subs, one can easily turn the subs off. The only &#039;problem&#039; is that the site has commercials, but I generally spend that time SRSing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I strongly agree with the issue of adult stubbornness.  There are a number of factors in play, it would seem.  Definitely as you&#039;ve pointed out there&#039;s the wanting of the &quot;one button&quot; approach, though I blame the modern American media especially for this one (it&#039;s all consumer-oriented, each advertiser attempting to promise grander results than the next, disillusioning the poor folk into thinking they are kings to whom the world will belong if only they dish out a sufficient enough amount of money at a cause).  

There&#039;s also the issue of the adult ego - adults hate being wrong, they hate feeling like they can&#039;t understand something.  As they try to study, the ego becomes stronger until it screams at them to stop trying the thing they are bad at and to return to the thing they are good at in order to help the ego feel better.  Children have no egos, they simply have no choice but to go through countless series of mistakes until they ultimately achieve the knowledge. 

Another factor that comes to mind is learned helplessness.  While children experience no reserve at trying something over and over again, even if it&#039;s falling off a bike and looking silly, adults have often learned to fear failure.  They have instructed themselves that in order to avoid that which they fear, they must not pursue that particular venue.  This is a subconscious habit that runs in many adults, especially if they are used to following established routines every day that they have grown comfortable in. 

An interesting thought just came to mind, too.  Imagine if someone had never learned to ride a bicycle.  Think of all the hard-headed adults you know.  Picture them trying to learn to ride a bicycle for the first time.  How likely is it that they would agree to go through with it?  They&#039;d rather stand in the corner and frown and nod at the children riding bikes than &quot;stoop down&quot; to learning it themselves.  And then they group up and blame it on &quot;deterioration of ability due to age&quot;.  As long as they keep nodding at each other and agreeing with this &quot;consensus&quot; they get to live in a world that feels comfortable to them because in it, they are not at fault.  But really, they&#039;re just being too uptight and keeping themselves from having fun.

Sorry, felt like ranting a bit.  =P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this great web site!

Question:
Does anyone have any good advice on Japanese radio streams? I only found two fully Japanese radio streams at
http://www.windowsmedia.com/radioui/Search.aspx?culture=en-us

i-Radio is fairly good, from what I can tell and the other stream is a live stream of the Tokyo stock market ( &#062;_&#062;)


Any other good fully Japanese radio streams from Japan? Anyone?
Thanks in advance.]]></description>
