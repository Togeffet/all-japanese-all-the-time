					<description><![CDATA[I know this is a 2 year old review, but I just finally bought the book and wanted to let Khatz know that Dr. Medina explicitly mentions spaced repetition when talking about Dr. Hermann Ebbinghaus: &quot;We now know that the space between repetitions is the critical component from transforming temporary memories into more persistent forms. Spaced learning is greatly superior to massed learning.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I ordered the German version of this and got it in the mail today. Just flipping through, it looks like everything was translated rather well. Also, I think it is formated quite sufficiently. Bolded titles, numbered and bulleted lists, italics, etc. So, it was probably, as you put it, an issue with the translator being a little too rushed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I can’t wait till Japanese books start getting the Kindle treatment.&quot;

You and the rest of the Japanosphere. Actually, it seems that the new kindle can display Japanese and Chinese characters, but the actual amount of J-books you can buy/download on kindle is currently something like 300 (literally). ;_; Which is of course nothing.

The second amazon.co.jp decides to seriously jump on the kindle bandwagon, I&#039;m gonna be all over it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This book really is fantastic. I&#039;ll be writing in article about it on my site sometime.

For anyone nervous about breaking the L2-only streak, this is the book to do it with. The rewards you reap will be far greater than the setback of reading in English. William brings up a good point that it just helps you restructure your life.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope Momoko-san is tall ;P. But seriously, I&#039;m gonna have to breakdown and find a Japanese copy of this book to read. I&#039;ve put it off because I didn&#039;t want to read it in English, but if there&#039;s a J-version I&#039;ll have to get it...or maybe just read his website, lol.]]></description>
