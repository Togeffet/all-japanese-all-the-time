					<description><![CDATA[amazing stuff as usual khatz, i have recently realized teh power of reading, the sheer power of it! i mean, u being to see and recall sentence structures so much easier and actually retain so many words you weren&#039;t even trying to learn. I have one question, i am reading a wonderful site for 2 hours a a day, the storeis are all short fairy tales, and in just a few weeks my comprehension of them has shot up to around 30 to 40 percent, thanks alot. IM wondering is reading short stories almost in there entrieity rather then skimming a large book something that  you would recommend?I know there is no truly correct way to doing this, but what is your own opinion?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with this. This way, you are increasing the chances of getting you interested in actually reading a book. Let&#039;s say I read a book the &quot;sloppy&quot; way and hit on a scene, where the main character ends up being betrayed, a friend of him gets killed and tons of other plottwist awesomeness happens, and now let&#039;s say it&#039;s in my L2 language, and I actually understood 70 % of the scene, that would definetely increase my desire to read the book the &quot;proper&quot; way, because I would like to know how it all came to that situation, and my interest in mastering my L2 would also be multiplied, because I&#039;d be like: &quot;Holy crap, I actually understood what happened in this scene, I&#039;ve actually come pretty far, I remember when I even couldn&#039;t do...&quot; and so on. 
We get into shows and animes the same way actually. We&#039;re being &quot;sloppy&quot; and goofing arround on youtube, and then we eventually hit upon an epic opening for an anime, and get interested in it. We&#039;re like &quot;Holy crap, look at this badass, I want to know his background story&quot; Or we see a girl with big boobs and say : &quot;I want her to have more screentime. ;)&quot; (Will this actually make you watch the whole anime, I don&#039;t know lol.) haha]]></description>
