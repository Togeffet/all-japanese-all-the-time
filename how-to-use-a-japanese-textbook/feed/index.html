					<description><![CDATA[Okay, so I&#039;m not sure where exactly to ask this, but I guess here is as good as anywhere(?):

I know textbooks suck; I have some I&#039;ve used for sentence mining and by the second book I&#039;m all &quot;augh, I hate this, I want to mine sentences from the hordes of fanfics I have bookmarked!&quot; But I find that even if I look up all the words in a sentence from something I see on a Japanese website I don&#039;t understand the sentence. I know basic grammar, and I can sometimes guess how it&#039;s supposed to go, but I hate not being &#039;quite sure&#039;. Currently when I mine sentences from Japanese websites I only put the meaning of words, even if i don&#039;t understand the sentence. But is this really helping me? I don&#039;t know... I feel like the only place I can get sentences that I understand is from those boring textbooks. This is kind of why I&#039;m having trouble switching to Japanese-Japanese QA in my SRS. Well, that and even when I look up the definition of words with a J-J dictionary I can understand the definition at all... (Have I just not done enough reps with my 500+ cards... or what?)

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give; I really love this website and all its content. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just anything, ANYTHING but &quot;Japanese: The Spoken Language.&quot;

First of all, not only is there not a single Japanese character in sight in the whole freaking book, but it uses the most irregular romanization I&#039;ve ever seen. Seriously, it&#039;s terrible.

Also, there&#039;s pages and pages of uninterrupted, overanalyzed grammar. After &quot;reading&quot; them I just go ?_? (usually with an accompanying 何これ！？, right?) Seriously, it&#039;s terrible. It&#039;s scary. I should post a photo sometime– just, don&#039;t do it.

That&#039;s beside the fact about it being outdated as hell. It still talks about &quot;便利なタイプライター&quot; (useful typewriters), okay? Typewriters haven&#039;t been all that useful for YEARS. (I mean, it&#039;s just an example but w/e.)

Spare yourself your sanity. I only have it for school requirements, just like I use Windows purely for a school requirement, and…I digress.

Point is, don&#039;t do it! :)

Great tips though, I&#039;ll try my best!これからも頑張ろうね〜　仕様がないかも。]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just anything, ANYTHING but &#8220;Japanese: The Spoken Language.&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all, not only is there not a single Japanese character in sight in the whole freaking book, but it uses the most irregular romanization I&#8217;ve ever seen. Seriously, it&#8217;s terrible.</p>
<p>Also, there&#8217;s pages and pages of uninterrupted, overanalyzed grammar. After &#8220;reading&#8221; them I just go ?_? (usually with an accompanying 何これ！？, right?) Seriously, it&#8217;s terrible. It&#8217;s scary. I should post a photo sometime– just, don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s beside the fact about it being outdated as hell. It still talks about &#8220;便利なタイプライター&#8221; (useful typewriters), okay? Typewriters haven&#8217;t been all that useful for YEARS. (I mean, it&#8217;s just an example but w/e.)</p>
<p>Spare yourself your sanity. I only have it for school requirements, just like I use Windows purely for a school requirement, and…I digress.</p>
<p>Point is, don&#8217;t do it! 🙂</p>
<p>Great tips though, I&#8217;ll try my best!これからも頑張ろうね〜　仕様がないかも。</p>

					<description><![CDATA[NHK offers a free textbook at http://www.nhk.or.jp/lesson/english/learn/story/index.html
It has 100 lessons, and each of them comes with 5 minutes of audio (around 30 seconds of which are in Japanese) that you can listen to while going through the text. I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty good for a bilingual textbook. It doesn&#039;t even try to waste your time with useless tasks, it just gives you a few hundred Japanese sentences with English translations, wrapped up in a little story about a martial arts student who comes to Japan in order to become an Aikido master (you can do a lot worse for a textbook story). 

But, I have to say, &quot;mining&quot; this thing got boring pretty quick for me, even though it&#039;s not all that long. I lost interest after lesson 36 or so... dem computer games I&#039;ve got here are much more interesting, and going through them feels a lot less like work. Maybe I&#039;ll finish up the rest of the book in a couple of weeks or so... but for now, finishing Planetarian 〜小さな星の夢〜　and Ever17 has priority :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yes, Japanese for Everyone is THE book. In my opinion it takes you REALLY FAR and where grammar is presented, it&#039;s presented in a *useful* way. The accompanying audio (&#039;out of print&#039;) is great too and you can get it here and there legally, as it&#039;s not in shops anymore.]]></description>
