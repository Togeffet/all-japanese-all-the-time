					<description><![CDATA[wwww There is an &quot;end game&quot; for getting used to Japanese.

I believe that when I get fluency, those close to me will be very FURIOUS at me, for not doing what THEY wanted me to do.

Example, I order Japanese food at Amazon, just because I had extra money and wanted to try different things.  To my surprise, the food was REALLY good and not as expensive as previously thought(most of it at least).  I want to do it again a few weeks later, except on a different site.

I did this, and brother is starting to call me a weeaboo for preferring something else over the food here in America.  When I get fluency I know at least 3 people who will immediately want to use me like a wet sponge, 1 of which I HAVE to live with for a very long time, another who is my father and the other a family friend who is old, stubborn and likes to try to manipulate me with varying success each time.

I&#039;m VERY annoyed at this, but I&#039;m a terrible speaker in my L1, so it really cannot be helped.

In spite of this, I will continue even if something bad happens because I truly find Japanese very fun and because I probably have the intelligence of a 7 year old(at least that&#039;s what those around me think).  Besides, writing/typing/speaking my problems out really relives stress for me, even if nothing happens/nobody will ever listen.


P.S.   I have no plans on moving to Japan.  I simply enjoy the food and the language so much nowadays.  It&#039;s the main thing keeping me quite happy in spite of all the bad things that happened.  

It&#039;s ironic really, my brother wants me to try different things, but gets mad because he&#039;s pretty much a meathead weightlifter who wants me to be a meathead like him when I have no interest in such.

He wants me to eat lots of protein when I usually eat whatever I feel like at the time, usually lacking in protein because I either don&#039;t care or actually forget to eat such things.]]></description>

新年快樂!! 恭喜發財 !!!

Well, maybe not in Japan, but I&#039;m sure you inspired more than a few Chinese learners.  Thank you again for helping people improve themselves, regardless of what language they want to learn.]]></description>
