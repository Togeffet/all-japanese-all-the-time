					<description><![CDATA[I just tested out Khatzumemo with a few sentence items. I must agree with Jack Dietz that it would be much quicker if one could skip the stats page in between reps. I really love that one can insert HTML into the question and answer fields. Useful for inserting images from a separate server (i.e. -- Photobucket, Imageshack). 

The only issue I have is that it&#039;s online. Useful for mobile phones, but could be dangerous. You basically relying on AJATT being around for as long as you are using Khatzumemo. What would be really cool is a release of the source code, because I&#039;d love to run this straight off my machine and be able to edit whatever. Having a test server on your home computer is pretty much necessary if you&#039;re a web student. Plus, having it on the machine vs. a server speeds things up quite a bit. I&#039;d just have to figure out the database structure, which, I don&#039;t imagine to be too complicated.

Enough babble. -- Thanks Khatzumoto.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use KhatzuMemo.
Most requested features for KhatzuMemo:
1) Put an option to skip item stats page and go directly to the next item.
6000 stats pages for 6000 reps adds up!
2) Put next interval on the scoring page like it does in Anki
3) Password change feature
4) Password recovery feature based on your email]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just wondering because it&#039;s kind of an odd feeling people get when a new method is presented. You get the feeling that the old method doesn&#039;t work anymore. At least, that&#039;s kind of how I felt. Which is why I do the Audio+Image thing talked about in the Chinese notes instead of text only.]]></description>
