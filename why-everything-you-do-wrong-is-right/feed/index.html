					<description><![CDATA[The Google list really hit home. That&#039;s exactly what I did when I was first starting out. I read blogs in Japanese, I blogged in Japanese myself. For some reason now that I&#039;ve started to get into the blogging game again, I&#039;m more English-centric„Éºthe blogs I read are in English, and I write mostly only in English because writing in Japanese is &quot;hard&quot;... Definitely need to fix that. I love being able to figure things out, and learn more about what people are actually thinking about in Japan rather than rely on secondhand sources. It&#039;s time to take back the control! (She says, as she actually has another 10 mins allotted to catch up on AJATT blog posts. &#060;-after that, I promise! I have a timer and everything!) Thank you always for motivating!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a way, yes, yes it is right! You already know at least one language, and you&#039;re &quot;just&quot; getting  another one for free. That probably means you can learn even more languages... How come you are getting used to that &quot;wrong&quot; language of yours? Copy that behaviour and paste it straight into the language that you want to learn. 

There are no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; languages, they&#039;re all beautiful (unlike women, whoever said so is a lair). They  have a lot of things in common (not grammer, grammer sucks), but a &quot;feeling&quot;, feel more languages and you can feel others easier. It&#039;s like hitting on women, it get&#039;s easier some how, get&#039;s your confidence up when you score. So just keep scoring, because unlike women, there are no bitches and they never stand you up. They&#039;re easy, always waiting for you, you just have to show up!]]></description>

Or better yet, instead of wasting time telling Khatz off, why not use that time to study some Japanese?!? It&#039;s not like you&#039;re paying to read this site. Chill out!]]></description>
