					<description><![CDATA[Hi! I&#039;ve been reading this site and think it&#039;s great. The ALTs in our community have also used this extensively when preparing for orientations on how to learn Japanese. 

I just wanted to add to the list of suggested reading:

There are two; one for fiction and one for short essays. The books are arranged in order of increasing difficulty and there are English translations on the left side with Japanese on the right. The thing is, the translations are really by phrase, perfect for Anki input.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with whoever said more resources, I recently got a game which is perfect for me, ゼルダの伝説 夢幻の砂時計 for DS, because there&#039;s a lot of kanji, and the furigana is only visible when you click it. With fixed furigana I can&#039;t help but look at the furigana first before giving the kanji a chance. I&#039;m not sure if a lot of games have that, the only other game I tried to play was Pokemon Pearl which I love, but got bored of because it&#039;s kanji-less :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding manga, my suggestion to beginners (and people at any other level) is to read &quot;よつばと！&quot;. It&#039;s so funny and fun and the vocabulary used is very simple, while still being of everyday use. Right now it&#039;s the only thing that I can read (almost) entirely without the help of a dictionary. But don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s not meant for children.

Also, you may want to try げんしけん, because it&#039;s another great example of everyday Japanese, and it&#039;s not excessively difficult. It&#039;s also very interesting, because it depicts the lives and adventures of a group of otaku.

Those are the ones I&#039;ve found to have the best balance difficulty-enjoyment for me, as of now. Hope you check them out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Heya Khatz,

In regards to your request for more ideas for articles, I think an interesting article would be about how to compose a resume in Japanese. Maybe include examples of how you did it and the like. 

That could also tie in with an article on that job fair you went to, as well. 

Good article!

					<description><![CDATA[I Love this website. However there are a few things I think need to be discussed a bit further..The first is that of using these methods after getting to intermediate stage using the uneffective conventional methods. In particular i would like to ask James or anyone else who started the sentence method at intermediate level, what was the rough timeline of your progress. I studied Japanese full time in Japan for over a year and reached the (JLPT) 2級　level, but low and behold found that my speaking was still a bit stilted and that I couldnt really read real things! I have now come to my senses and found and have started follwing the method in this site....but i would like some feedback from someone who has started halfway through as it were. The second thing i wanted to mention was the wisdom of learning the language before actually moving to Japan...I think this is a very very wise move.

Also for job resources try: careercross (they dont mention any qualifications)
or Japan career  (you generally need 2級　level or above but if you can actually speak the language that might be even better!)

Also no mention of Dr Slump on this site...this comic was easy to get into the swing of and he repeats alot of the same vocab plus its pretty funny.]]></description>
