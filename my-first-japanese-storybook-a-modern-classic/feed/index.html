					<description><![CDATA[That is a really interesting review on the product, Jaybot. I wonder what exactly do people want in a book? I would be really interested to see Khatz put a poll up with miscellaneous options and to see the spread of those options. Then again, I just saw Stephen Colbert&#039;s pollster episode last night, so many I just want to see a poll on something I am interested in :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[マイファースト初めてのジャパニーズ絵本 -&#062; it&#039;s great, it&#039;s fun and the author is shameless crazy (I hope he will appreciate). Pictures were probably done by a grown up child called Khatzumoto. Voices are good.

You won&#039;t find another great crazy japanese book like this one. You will like it if you like the AJATT fun. As always when a book is good, it&#039;s too short. 

Khatzumoto : next time could you deliver also a spreadsheet for SRS items?]]></description>
