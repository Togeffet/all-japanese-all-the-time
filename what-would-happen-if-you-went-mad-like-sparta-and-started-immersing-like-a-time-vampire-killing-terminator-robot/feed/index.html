					<description><![CDATA[This is my third time trying to get used to Japanese (last two attempts failed, and I can&#039;t really remember why...) and this time I&#039;m going all in! I think part of the issue was a lack of L2 material to keep me going (was pretty much running on 10-12 Vocaloid songs) so any recommendations on material/where to find it would be greatly appreciated. I also really like this idea of two audio sources at once, sounds exactly like the kind of crazy I&#039;d brew up. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ve been doing this more recently and i think its helping alot. But what I do is instead of having 2 headphones connected to 2 different audio players, i would gather a few audio tracks and using an audio editor program like Audacity, combine 2 audio tracks but have one played on the right ear and the other track played on the left. Then just upload on my ipod and go. Really good for repetition and like this post says, helps to kind of focus on one track if you want. Having tracks with different voices or speakers work really well too (in this case if you were using an audiobook where its one person speaking from chapter to chapter, it can help get a different audio to help focus attention )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool ideas here for sure, but im not really into the whole not taking a break part, if i read that correctly that is. I find that a total break form anything, language learning or guitar is amazingly effective at both somehow consolidating what you know and keeping motivation high, I have learned slowly and painfully that the real key is to maintain a state of non boredom! when your mind starts wandering during srs reps, STOP, do some guitar, ear training, whatever it is u like, something totally different(even if its still related to japanese)__, 10 mins later an hour 2 etc you will feel the urge again, and it will be fresh, 

Also, in terms of a technique to share with others, i have recently upped my reading ability a huge amount by reading blogs online of bands and female singers i love, wow, its so amazingly effective for me personally, its the emotional connection , and so many sentences are so interesting because of the fact they are describing the life of someone you admire, you literally cant forget them, at least that&#039;s been my experience, i find the recall of my blog and reading sentences vs my pre made srs decks is substantially higher, amazing stuff,.

Also, for some amazing reading material here is a wonderful sight of fairy tales and others stuff, sometimes hard to navigate but never hard to find a story http://hukumusume.com/douwa/pc/kaidan/index.html  . also, i use a great program called &quot;free youtube down loader,&quot; it has an amazing ability to donwlaod all the videos from a playlist, and i i use this to downloads gigabytes of great Japanese radio to my pc that i can listen to over and over, its great to find an interesting voice you really like too because its that much more interesting!! 

If anyone wants some great recommendations for youtube channels with tonnes of j radio to downlaod give me an email or reply here!

Of course the reason I starerd all this is to be able to understand teh beautfily songs and singesr i hve grown to love in japaens nd i have been dualy rewardeede, using vocab form songs is amzingly efective for me again, because of that emotial tie to the material. I basically never fail srs reps of song sentences!! I have grown to truly love the japanese language and i want to thank everyone and anyone on this site for inspring me to cointinue !!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[crazy thing is i&#039;ve thought about this before. Its just seemed to make sense. Its like doubling your listening time instead of listening to one thing for an hour, listen to two things which combines to 2 hours of immersion in one hour. I didnt do it for long but one thing I noticed is that, while listening to one thing on repeat for a couple of hours can be boring, having the dual audio makes it significantly LESS boring, especially if the different audio plays for a different length of time. Glad others thing of language learning &quot;hacks&quot; as well]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I tried this before. I ended up dropping it out of laziness. I can&#039;t say how well it worked or not but I can say out of the two things I was listening to there was always one I&#039;d rather listen to more than the other.]]></description>
