					<description><![CDATA[I decided to start my 4th video game in Japanese, and also the first one with Kanji yet without Furigana (I played Pokemon HG and the two NDS Zelda games in JP). This 4th one is Super Mario RPG, a game I&#039;ve always kept going back to (so hey, I already know the story!).

I wish to place my focus on reading Kanji, now that I can recognize them all. What I do is simple: I read through everything (doesn&#039;t matter if I don&#039;t understand), and if I stumble upon a Kanji word I don&#039;t know how to read, I look it up and add it to my new vocab deck (I&#039;ll review it later). So far, it&#039;s going quite great and I&#039;m having fun, especially when doing links with words I&#039;ve found often in previous games. I plan to always increase the level after finishing a game, so that there&#039;s always more Kanji to be found, but never an overwhelming amount.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is getting really off-topic, but there are lots of private servers for Ragnarok Online. I&#039;m sure at least one of them would be Japanese. MMOs aren&#039;t fun for a super long time, anyway, but I mean, if you like RPGs, you could at least look for alternative options like the one I mentioned.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Exactly what Japanese Level Up is talking about. Catching up on a two-week-long backlog of Anki reviews (Achievement Get! - Three-Day Monk Green Belt) feels almost like repeatedly going through Petalburg and stomping Goombas to get enough Star Points to fight Rawk Hawk, a miniboss from &lt;em&gt;three chapters later&lt;/em&gt;. (Sorry if you don&#039;t get it, the &quot;Paper Mario&quot; and &quot;Mario &#038; Luigi&quot; series are the only RPGs I&#039;ve actually been able to get my hands on.) Or going back to the katamari comparison (again, haven&#039;t found a copy of that game), having a car-sized katamari and trying to pick up sand. Well, I&#039;ve got 600 grains of sand stuck in my 靴 right now (200 shaped like kanji, 250 of the vocab type, and 50 unknowns), and good grief I want to get past those already!
 
Wow, that train of thought went out the 窓 in a hurry.]]></description>
