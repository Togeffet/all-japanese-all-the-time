					<description><![CDATA[Pride has been holding my back in a way since I started. I thought being fluent would be cool and I could stay in my little immersion chrysalis until that happened and come out and everyone would be like &quot;wow!&quot;. I thought anything less was unacceptable. Trying to talk to people at 4 months in I thought was unacceptable. However that really started to kill my motivation. I realize the only times I feel inspired to learn the language are when I know I can use it. And if I keep my headphones on or stay in my room listening, I&#039;m not using it and its like I am going against what I really want to get out of the language making the process ASM instead of fun. Now I&#039;m starting to realize that fluency is just an abstract concept, like perfection or infinity. Its not a goal worth aiming for and my brain knows it so it says either do whats fun or give up. The aim in my opinion should be to reach that point where the language feels like its yours. Its feels native to you. That is the beauty of language learning IMO. Its like you grow a second soul when you have a second language that feels natural to you. Also its like growing a second citizenship. Second soul more so tho. I reached that point at around 8 or 9 months and I had maybe a 2000 word vocab but gained through immersion and audio srs cards so it was in there like swim wear not just memorized by rote where I could forget it if I shook my head too hard lol. Also though, having fun with it, talking to people as soon as you can, is probably the best way to become fluent because why would you quit when you have built relationships with real people and comic book characters maybe. I was also kinda scared I would reach a point where I would be content with how much I knew of the language. I think that situation might be reserved for people who only wanted to know enough to get by and not have fun in the process, like people going overseas to work but were never interested in the culture in the first place. We arn&#039;t in that situation. we like other cultures, japanese, chinese or whatever, and if we have that, and fun, we can&#039;t lose. We can only win.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember reading that for people with developmental disorders, such as autism, high quality input is very important.  Though the following article is for children, I have a feeling that it would also be true for adults:

https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&#038;q=cache:F5ymj1qclE8J:www.hms.harvard.edu/cidp/pub/pdfs/SevereDevDisordersBilingualism.pdf+&#038;hl=ja&#038;gl=us&#038;pid=bl&#038;srcid=ADGEESgNkxyLQB1R2Tnw5VrFXpyoXU8uu0HrARGNWoWI9toX3CIBUzjTljmFXThhIAaoUjFSa40TeedpgjZaSMD4j_s6-X-pcE5Qw15TIGhFhdMBpSoK0cmsOYBx7gDH6Wu5xfHYvYvm&#038;sig=AHIEtbQ7g9o9bCUAzdGAwNHRtktcd5IKFQ

Now, when I speak I can usually give the impression of being normal, but once you get to know me the autism will shine through more.  What would suck though is that for both of us when we speak Japanese we may still come across as funny, which would likely be blamed on having foreign accents or just being foreign, when autism may be more to blame.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This seems to confirm the warnings of Antimoon and AJATT regarding early, forced output:

&quot;One possible way to account for pronunciation errors in both the L1 and the L2, but 
especially so in the L2, is by using Krashen’s Input Hypothesis and possibly positing that 119
bilinguals are reutilizing their own incorrect pronunciations as input and perceiving this input to 
be correct, thereby eliminating any opportunity for correction. Krashen (1985) argues that simply 
speaking in the target language does not result in complete acquisition. He contends the 
commonly held belief that language learning of acquisition is contingent upon speaking abilities. 
Instead, he proposes that comprehensible output is the outcome of language acquisition. Thus, if 
mispronunciations are rarely corrected early in the acquisition process in the home, the family 
could speak a language that is different from the target language, and the individual has a 
diminished opportunity to produce comprehensible output. This could be a possible future 
direction in which my research could lead, potentially yielding more interesting findings.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Sweet link!! That guys a boss of language learning!
It seems that everything thinks ajatt is all about immersion and just doing sentences, but after going through your link i bet shadowing is one of the techniques that boosts your japanese considerably. I bet along with that extensive reading and copying out texts (scriptorium) are part of SS. I&#039;ve read all of this blog and I remember these being hinted at. Still an awesome site! Just my 2p on AJATT.]]></description>
