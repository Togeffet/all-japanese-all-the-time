					<description><![CDATA[Please Khatz, is there any way to export your collection from Khatzumemo since I&#039;d like to get a back-up. And manually pulling down about 700 cards is utmost BMT. 
Please, if there is a way, enlighten me ;D If not, I beg you to add it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[„Åï„Åô„Åå, You were right... I just had to stop inputting for a day or two and those sentences I&#039;d inputted weeks ago and forgotten about suddenly popped right up! :) „Å≥„Å£„Åè„Çä„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅÈù¢ÁôΩ„Åã„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ
And I guess it is useful to see how many I didn&#039;t get that day, too (where it&#039;ll say, „Åü„Å®„Åà„Å∞„ÄÅ‚Äù105/120 reps today&quot;; or in my case, &quot;105/147&quot;)... I understand that it doesn&#039;t actually take any longer time, but somehow it sure seems like it, when I see that higher number, lol.

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, a search function! Yes! I&#039;ve been waiting for that!

I think I like the new behavior for misses, although I haven&#039;t had the opportunity to use it yet (been travelling back home). I just have to make sure to know the stuff well enough so that I&#039;m not sitting there all day! XD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amy--also, for those older items, try using the &quot;Do More Reps&quot; function, you will get to them eventually. The thing about forcing a a limit of 100/day is that I had to chose to prioritize.  So I chose to prioritize whatever items were already &quot;in process&quot;, especially items you get wrong a lot, or that have really long intervals (so they only come once in a while).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;1.) Today instead of 100 reps for the day, it kept adding more and more as I went alongÔºé Why is that happening and how can I keep it at 100 reps per day?

What it&#039;s doing is excluding your &quot;redos&quot;, where you had to repeat the same item again because you got a low score on it. You still do 100 unique items, but if you have a redo it may come to more than 100 reps. I had 120 reps today. I thought it would be better in terms of learning. Do you still want to keep this behavior?



&gt;2.) I noticed when I was looking at all my sentences that there‚Äôs a bunch of them I added long ago that don‚Äôt seem to have ever been put into the ‚Äòdeck‚Äô at all..

Did you add those by hand, or from a file?]]></description>
