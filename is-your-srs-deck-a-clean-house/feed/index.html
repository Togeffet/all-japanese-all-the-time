I recently started using SURUSU maybe 3-4 weeks ago mostly for sentences and everyday I miss adding sentences really brings me down since I know things will start making sense once I keep SRSing those sentences. could the site be going through an update? Is anyone else having this issue as of late (this week mostly)?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For some reason, even though i have gone monolingual, i still think of a sentence meaning in english..

Example:
Front
この作品
Back
この作品「さくひん」
作品（作ったもの）

Even though i learned it with a japanese definition, i still manage to think &quot;made thing&quot; when i see it.

Another question, should I bother to learn the readings of definitions?
Such as:

水没（水中に忱んで見えなくなること）
Something to do with In water becomes cannot see, right? I already feel the meaning, but should  bother to learn readings of kanji in the definition and should i try to understand everything in it even if i get a feel for it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[16,000 or so for me. I don&#039;t think that there is a total &quot;too many&quot;, put personally there is a daily limit for reps. My daily reps are 150-200 so its not a problem for me.
If you have a feeling there is too much, there probably is. Delete liberally, leave only ones that you can give yourself a good reason not to delete.
Remember that Katz recommends 10,000 sentences, and I would definitely agree that is a good target to have. If you are like me and don&#039;t have a problem with a big deck (that sounds funny) go nuts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Running into a small problem...
I&#039;ve done some major cleaning in one of my decks and I find myself often marking cards as failed just so I can them more. I do this for almost every card in this deck because they are so awesome. Gets really tough with 100s of reviews every day though.

I think I have issues :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t bother translating it.  Just define the new words in the answer section.  Use a translation if you have one available (the Yahoo dictionary is a reliable source for sentences w/ translations) but otherwise don&#039;t worry about it.  If you&#039;re at least passingly familiar with the grammar, that&#039;s all you&#039;ll need.  If it doesn&#039;t make sense to you with all of the words defined... skip it and move on.  And it&#039;s a good way to transition to monolingual cards.  (Just swap out the English definitions for Japanese.)]]></description>
