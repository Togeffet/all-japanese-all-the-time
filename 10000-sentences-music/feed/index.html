					<description><![CDATA[Looking at some of the music selections, as it seems Katz is definitely into the rap type of thing I just wanted to add my 2 cents.

For folks into more alternative rock formats I want to definitely give a 2nd thumbs up to the listing of Asian Kung-Fu Generation.  With these guys basically just think of Weezer.  On catchy song after the other, lyrics that are understandable, and decent rock-credi prowess.

A band I didn&#039;t see on the list is Number Girl.  These guys are just plain genious.  Fairly equivalent to a Pixies, Sonic Youth, Nirvana type of mix.  They&#039;re not necessarily great for language learning since they&#039;re screaming inaudibly half the time or playing around with crazy distortion or guitar riffs, but if you just want a Japanese band that can flat out rock they&#039;re probably as good as it gets.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, I have a question. It might be good. O.O
Should we use lines as sentences, or a whole lyrical phrase? What I mean is....
Should we use this :どんな時だって (First line of Utada Hikaru&#039;s song, Hikari)
Or this : どんな時だって (first lyrical passage of the song)
             ただ一人で
             運命忘れて
             生きてきたのに
             突然の光の中、目が覚める
             真夜中に
I was wondering, because a lot of times, a whole passage is written to convey ONE message. But it seems like sometimes one lyrical line could work alone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, yeah. I&#039;ve been listening to a LOT of Utada Hikaru, yet I had no idea I could use the lyrics as sentences. I was getting frustrated, too! D: I&#039;m a sophomore in high school with no job, and I have no idea where to look for sentences. I mean.... I do....But the books and everything...I cannot afford~ This was great knowing this, but I still continue to search for ways to get sentences~

					<description><![CDATA[@Brent
&gt;Should we use lyrics as sentences?
Yeah, definitely.

&gt;it would mess up my Japanese learning.
It wouldn&#039;t. It&#039;s no different from learning poetry. There are lots of allusions and allowances for rhyme, but it still makes just as much sense as an English song would to an English speaker/user; the vocab and structure are all there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey! I love this site, and when I get the kanji down, I may have something to work with. Anyways, I had a question about sentences and Japanese Songs.

Should we use lyrics as sentences? (Because sentences are usually not grammatically correct...)

I just wanted to be sure, because it would be nice to actually know what they&#039;re saing, but I don&#039;t know if it would mess up my Japanese learning.

Thanks for listening!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey buddy! Newcomer to the site, but incredibly impressed (and, I&#039;ll admit, annoyingly jealous) of what you&#039;ve got here. At any rate, I hadn&#039;t seen this mentioned anywhere so I thought I&#039;d link this to you:

http://powersugoi.net/tingdong/index.php

It&#039;s a great resource, especially since I picked up the Chinese version of Mulan the other day and I&#039;m incredibly addicted to &quot;男子漢&quot; (http://powersugoi.net/tingdong/song.php?song=189).

Anyway. That&#039;s enough out of me. If you&#039;ve found it, great, if not, then I contributed something! Yay! Keep it up with the Chinese!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz (If I may be so bold),
  Thanks for the excellent posts!!  You beat me to my next question.  I&#039;ve started with 
the music and needed a source for lyrics.  Since you like hip-hop, I recommend Shonen No
Kaze.  Great band with a reggae flavor.

P.S. Anyone else have any recommendations for music?  I mostly listen to hard rock and the occasional hip-hop.]]></description>
