					<description><![CDATA[I think this all depends on the software you use to learn.
Mnemosyne/iSRS make you give a score between 0 and 5, that is 6 scores in total ! That&#039;s way too much
Some other methods give you the choice of Yes or No. Not enough.
I moved to using JapanEasy[1] (seems to be iOS only) and they ask for Yes/No/Maybe which is to my mind the best way to do it. I don&#039;t spend time worrying whether I should rate this card 2 or 3 like I did with other methods and this gave me tremendous results. (and I like the example sentences that you can access from all the cards btw)

					<description><![CDATA[The way I&#039;ve been doing it for the Lazy Kanji deck in Anki:

*Remembered the keyword just by seeing the kanji: Very Easy
*Didn&#039;t recall from the kanji itself, but remembered after reading the sentence with the kanji: Easy
*Didn&#039;t recall even with the sentence, but was on the right track: Hard
*Total failure, not even close, &quot;D&#039;oh I missed!&quot;: „ÇÇ„ÅÜ‰∏ÄÂ∫¶ (but I almost never use this button outside of the first or second review)

If I stick to these guidelines, I can usually power through a 25-block of kanji in about two minutes (I have all my decks timeboxed to questionlimit=25, another reason I really don&#039;t like using the „ÇÇ„ÅÜ‰∏ÄÂ∫¶ button because it messes up the cardcount for the rest of that day).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever been consistent about this, but maybe it&#039;s not that important, because:
A, I&#039;ll certainly see the card again, B, it&#039;s one freaking entry out of thousands, and C, anything really important will turn up again in another context. 
In short, I just wing it. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I use Surusu and I...so rarely give myself a 5. I only really do it if I&#039;m just sick and tired of seeing the card, and would like it go away for months/years. Maybe I&#039;m grading myself too harshly, but it seems right for me. I like having more reps I think :D

But yeah, my default is 4 if I got it right, 3 if I got it right after serious hesitation (30-60 seconds or more), 2 if I got it wrong but was, like, super close mentally and 0 if I just totally drew a blank. I hardly ever use 1...can&#039;t fathom a purpose for it.

Sometimes I&#039;ll score myself a 3 knowing I will see it in exactly the same amount of time as the last interval, if I just really like the card or am having some struggle with it.¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For Anki, if I don&#039;t know it or I need to read the story to write the kanji, I grade it a 1 and do it again. When it comes up again I just hit spacebar, which let&#039;s Anki decide the best grade (which is usually a 2 if you answered it wrong that day.)
If I can answer it correctly I just hit spacebar and move on. If I felt it was¬†ridiculously¬†easy, like Êú®„ÄÅI&#039;ll grade it very easy. Usually it&#039;s just a hit of the spacebar, minimal thinking, minimal effort.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been SRSing for about 9 months now. Although I&#039;m usually an anxiety goblin who worries about everything, it never occurred to me to worry about how to grade a card. So I&#039;ve just been bashing the keys on instinct and immediately. My reaction to this article was 100% surprise to learn that anybody worries about grading.
¬†
The point for you guys is this: I&#039;ve done zero worrying for 9 months and the scheduling has been fine. So if you want to worry less, you can rest assured that the scheduling will still be OK. It is safe to chill. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I pick the first score that comes to mind. The way I see it, if I&#039;m wrong, the next time the card comes around my knowledge (or lack thereof) will let me score appropriately.

Yes, there are times when I pick a score and I go &quot;oh **** I really should have gone with the other&quot;, but then I just let it go. No point worrying about it. Grab a score and go.¬†]]></description>
