					<description><![CDATA[Sennheiser CX300. Will set you back $20-40, shopping around recommended and be wary of knock-offs if you shop online.
They are in-ear &#039;passive&#039; noise reducing headphones with amazing sound for the price.
Not everyone likes in-ear phones, but I can wear these all day in the office 7-9 hours without any discomfort whatsoever. The only discomfort caused is to my colleages, who now have to walk to my desk everytime they want to ask me someting - I simply don&#039;t hear them.
Even on long haul flights (London-Tokyo) they are great and if you fly with Virgin, you can plug them straight into the arm rest socket and have less noise and hear more movie. Sweet!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve tended to use earbuds, which DO have a definite difference in the &#060;20, &#060;100, etc ranges. Spent a couple of months with a pair of Etymotic 6i-rs or whatever before I broke the wonderful things from overuse/abuse [they have GREAT sound quality, and they&#039;re very isolating... meaning I listened to music on loud airplanes at minimum volume, meaning less hearing damage] [also, super comfortable]. I can still listen to music, thankfully, because I also have a set of speakers which I use often, an ipod + fm transmitter I use in the car, and a laptop that I use almost everywhere else. 

The great bit on earbuds is you can hide &#039;em and wear them to class. Can&#039;t beat it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently using (or plan to use when I begin my hardcore Mandarin studies) is a pair of Philips SHS3200, which are just perfect for walking around, as the cord isn&#039;t too long, and the earbuds themselves can&#039;t fall out.

(http://www.amazon.com/Philips-SHS3200-37-Flexible-Earhook/dp/B000G0JKNM/ref=pd_bbs_8?ie=UTF8&#038;s=electronics&#038;qid=1224242629&#038;sr=8-8)

In addition, and in order to reduce background noise when I&#039;m on the bus or studying in the dining room when people have the TV going is a pair of Skullcandy earbuds. VERY comfortable to wear. More comfortable than my pair of Sennheissers which I use for music.

					<description><![CDATA[@Ed
You might not be able to &#039;hear&#039; 8hz but you can feel it, which makes a difference if you like bass slam/extension. It&#039;s perfectly safe for your ears, assuming you keep the volume low enough.

Also, like I said earlier, what it says on the box rarely matches with what the headphones can actually produce, and a larger range doesn&#039;t necessarily mean the headphone sounds better]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[8Hz? Wtf? Why would they make something that goes lower than the range of human sound response? Your ears might take some damage from something like that, but I have no clue.

Also, these are my favorite pair of headphones that I have experimented with so far:

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a fan of Grados for home use.
The sennheiser rec&#039;s above are also good.
Koss ksc-75 are amazing given their price point and come with a lifetime full replacement warranty.
My favorite headphones when I need quiet are Jays q-jays (a bit pricey)
I&#039;ve seen denon&#039;s as a good go to brand for hip-hop/rap, though haven&#039;t ever owned any.

Generally the frequencies printed on the box of headphones are not good indicators of actual frequency response :/
Poke around head-fi.org &#039;s forums if you&#039;re willing to open up your wallet a bit.

For sleep and around campus I wear crappy earbuds, generally I&#039;ll be listening to pure voice, where I don&#039;t care about sq as much.]]></description>

<p>Generally the frequencies printed on the box of headphones are not good indicators of actual frequency response :/<br />
Poke around <a href="http://head-fi.org" class="autohyperlink">head-fi.org</a> &#8216;s forums if you&#8217;re willing to open up your wallet a bit.</p>
<p>For sleep and around campus I wear crappy earbuds, generally I&#8217;ll be listening to pure voice, where I don&#8217;t care about sq as much.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to have to second the Sennheiser recommendation.  They know their headphones, and they have a lot of quality products even in the budget range.  I personally use the HD595 whenever I&#039;m at home (I&#039;m cool with just using some dinky little earbuds when I&#039;m out and about), and regardless of what Khatz says, there&#039;s totally a noticeable difference between quality headphones and cheap ones.  They key is just to make sure that the headphones actually ARE high-quality, and not just expensive, because the two don&#039;t always correlate.]]></description>

These are my wireless headphones. Although I have a slightly older version I think (these look a little different from my own). They are very comfortable for me. Sound quality is also very important to me and these did not disappoint (Of course they lose out to my wired headphones which can match speaker quality even on high volume).

Wireless headphones are good if you study at a desk and the wire gets in your way. It&#039;s good if you want to cook and listen to stuff. It&#039;s good if you have a roommate/significant other and don&#039;t want to bother them with your noise but still want to have mobility while listening to stuff.]]></description>
