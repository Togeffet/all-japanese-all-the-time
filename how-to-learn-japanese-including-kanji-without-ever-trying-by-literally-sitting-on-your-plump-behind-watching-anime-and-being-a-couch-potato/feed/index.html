					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been married to a Japanese woman for 19 years. Other than a few minimalist phrases like Good morning, wait a minute, Thanks, and How are you, my mother-in-law in Japan thinks my wife married the biggest moron in the US. (19 YEARS and all he can say to me is How are you??).

Truth be told, I see that Japanese is pretty simple gramatically, but since I have no real need to speak it (my wife speaks PERFECT broken English, I never learned it. I did at one time learn to stumble my way through Frnch and Spanish (4 years of Latin in High School certainly helped). I&#039;m also a jazz singer and most musicians seem to have an affinity for languages (they all have their own rhythms and flow), but Japanese vocabulary seems daunting. If I lived in Japan for six months, I&#039;m sure I would learn to speak it relatively well. Hopefully, your AJTTT methods will help me to impress both my lovely wife as well as her Mom and all of her  Japanese friends, both in the US and in Japan.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be perfectly honest, I stopped RTK a long time ago. About three or so weeks ago I started this exact process and I can pick up entire phrases without parsing them through my j=e translator in my head. I can enjoy parts of anime and reading just like english- by just understanding what was said/written. I stopped giving a flick about anything and just do my reps when I feel like and I just take it easy. I add a lot of MCDs at one time but I don&#039;t actively worry about any one of them.

Thanks for the update Khatz, and for everyone else, this actually works! Phrases are constantly popping into my head in situations where it would make sense. I can kinda remember kanji I reviewed a few times that go with a phrase, and for ones that are further off I can write from memory without having ever written them. That may be because I look at a lot of japanese [I have newspapers taped to the wall in a large swath] and my immersion environment, but that just goes to show that this shiz works!

If this is just three weeks in, I wonder how amazing 6 months or a year on this will be!]]></description>
