					<description><![CDATA[I think I might be tech-challenged...but I&#039;m having serious trouble with Surusu. I&#039;ve added some test cards so I could get a feel for how things worked. But every time I select Do Reps, a quick screen flashes with something like &quot;Reps done/Good job&quot; or something and then back to the single drop down menu again. Why won&#039;t it let me do the cards I put in? Am I just using this all wrong? I need help! Arigatou!]]></description>
