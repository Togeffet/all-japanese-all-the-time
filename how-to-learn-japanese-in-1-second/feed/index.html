					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE this post. Especially the butt-power part. Cause yup, we have to do a lot of sitting since we watch TV and use the computer a lot haha.
Today, I had an epiphany. I&#039;ve been studying my target language for almost 10 years (well, 7 years hardcor-ish) and I&#039;m really starting to get it now. I discovered your website about 3 years ago and I&#039;ve been trying to listen to my L2 more ever since. No, it doesn&#039;t (and shouldn&#039;t) take 10 years to learn a language. I was doing it the wrong way. Ironically, studying grammar and vocab worked for me when I learned Italian, but that&#039;s another story.
I finally feel like I&#039;m fluent. Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice blog!
Everything you write makes sense to me, motivates me, and inspires me.
Also I have this tiny request, would you allow me to translate this blog &quot;How to Learn Japanese in 1 second&quot; into Arabic
to help Arab learners of Japanese?
I&#039;ll mention the source of course.

P.S Sorry for any mistakes (English is not my mother tongue).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished posting Kanji on my wall got some many enforcements towards my own blog here quoting KHATZ in my posts! I loved this portion so true!

&quot;o, I know I keep saying this, but, Japanese isn‚Äôt something you acquire as much as something you turn into. And the only way you‚Äôre going to turn into it is by using (all of) what you have. And all you have is this tiny, precious moment that you‚Äôre busy wasting on deciding whether or not to watch Gwen‚Äôs new video. Solution: don‚Äôt watch it. Watch a Japanese video instead. Two years from now, you‚Äôll still be able to go back and YouTube ‚ÄúNo Doubt‚Äù in about two seconds; but for now, let it go. As Winston Churchill once said to me when we were hanging out: ‚ÄúGwen Stefani will still be pretty in two years, but if you don‚Äôt learn some Japanese right now‚Ä¶then in the morning you‚Äôll still be ignorant‚Äù.&quot;

Man learning and doing these things has cause me to appear to be CRAZY and people have treated my different but if you keep it up you will be good!  I started in March with basic classes in highschool and As I look back i SUCK way less than before! I can have a 100% Japanese conversation and am in a position to pic up more and more! ALways got audio in the background! LIVE everyday like your last!
GO hard! TIl it over loads!]]></description>
