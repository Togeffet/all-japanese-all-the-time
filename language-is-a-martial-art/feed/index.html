					<description><![CDATA[&quot;You don’t have to think, you just have to be.
You don’t have to listen, you just have to hear.
You don’t have to read, you just have to see.&quot;

&quot;You don’t have to control all the variables in order to achieve control of the entire situation. Like a row of dominos, you only have to topple one, to topple them all. All you have to do is put your body into Japanese — if you just keep your body there, Japanese will then put itself into your mind. I am repeating, restating and reiterating for a reason.&quot;

Those two quotes reminded my of my first few episodes of anime in Japanese only. Man, I felt so screwed and my mind couldn&#039;t comprehend. I either watched pictures to follow or I listened to Japanese and figured the plot. It really took some time to adapt, but in the end it worked out well.

All went down to: Get going, watch anime on end and eventually you will manage. 

Best regards from Germany

I&#039;ve finished RTK, so I guess I&#039;m at the good stage of this method.

I&#039;ve looked up lyrics before, it&#039;s partially effective for me. But I find it a lot easier when people add J-subs to a song I find it easier to follow and I learn readings for Kanji :D]]></description>

Well when you can read enough Kanji to look up Japanese song lyrics then use those with the song, so you don&#039;t do a &quot;Ken Lee&quot; yourself. I sang pretty much nothing but Gackt songs through high school, so I kinda mimic him when I sing, and usually do his songs when I go to Karaoke. 

Looking up songs is a great way to take a break from Kanji reps, Kanji can give me a headache after a while but singing a few Gackt or 嵐 or 氷室京介 songs makes the headache go away. Then I go back to Kanji reps. I&#039;m on about 1300 in the Heisig book, been slowing down recently though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you again Kaz, we&#039;re birds of a feather, though I think you&#039;re noisier.  I want to add that singing (notice I didn&#039;t say speaking) Japanese should also be apart of the fundamental training.  I noticed when I sang along with japanese songs, my ability to &#039;hear&#039; (read: remember, recall, distinguish, differentiate) improved .....like something out of a scifi movie.  Time slows, I can recognize words, though I might not know their meaning.  

  So, I&#039;m suggesting as part of anyone&#039;s language training, sing along, match sound for sound, not word for word, the singer&#039;s voice.  It does something (children just flat out do this) that can&#039;t be acquired from reading or  listening.  I feel qualified to say this because I watched anime &#038; tv for 15 years nearly every day (hooray for torrents and usenet) and couldn&#039;t really do jack with Japanese.

But with singing...something about it caused new brain cells to wiggle or old ones to make more friends or something.  Spend a month and memorize a song, to the degree you can sing along harmoniously with the singer and see how it affects your other areas.

  To me it feels like I own it.  It feels the way I imagine fluency is supposed to feel.  Though I don&#039;t have a vocabulary like i do in English;  kitto itsuka wo tsukamun da.  ne sou darou.

  So to fill out the be, see, hear list.  Don&#039;t have to speak, you just have to sing!

Thank you again Kaz for another timely and inspiring article.]]></description>
