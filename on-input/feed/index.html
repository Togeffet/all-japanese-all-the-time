					<description><![CDATA[It seems like the input hypothesis works for inspiration too.
Having an immersion environment has brought me back to learning Mandarin when just a few days ago I would be thinking maybe I&#039;m just not interested anymore. I might have stopped doing reps for days or even weeks but then something from the environment that still remains would re-ignite that fire. Because of this I think the environment is soooo key because after a while of not seeing enough of your L2 you might, subconsciously even, start to think it&#039;s not worth learning(as well as being confused and upset at yourself for feeling less and less interested. 

Side Note: This inspiration input thing seems to work with any kind of inspiration like art for example. If you want to stay inspired to create art or music, make sure your seeing and hearing enough because input equals output.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;How do you know when something‚Äôs really stuck?
&#062;Excuse me for sounding like a Daoist text here, but‚Ä¶you‚Äôll know when you know. Or, more &#062;accurately, when you know, you won‚Äôt know. It‚Äôll be so obvious to you that you won‚Äôt even &#062;be aware that it‚Äôs obvious to you. When you start taking it for granted, or using it almost &#062;unconsicously, that‚Äôs when you know. Does that make sense? Like, when it‚Äôs so clear that &#062;it‚Äôs no longer an issue, that‚Äôs when you know.

Wow - I must admit that that answer really did make me laugh :-)  Don&#039;t get me wrong - I completely agree - it&#039;s just the way you put it - excellent!

BTW - though only having a monstrously large Supermemo/SRS database right now (with only a still relatively small Japanese component), rather than the truly gargantuan databases that Khazumoto and others on posting here have - I personally would say that the point at which you know something has stuck is the point at which you become complacent, and start to believe that you don&#039;t need your SRS anymore!

At least that&#039;s my experience - and I respond to this erroneous belief by quickly swatting it away before it really becomes entrenched, I stop doing my reps, and revert to my pre-SRS days of struggling to remember anything at all...]]></description>

No. Not that I can think of.

					<description><![CDATA[Heya Khatzumoto!

I have a (probably silly) question! How do you know when something&#039;s really stuck? I mean, I have like a bazillion sentences in my SRS and I study about an hour or so a day and, yes, I am improving greatly, but is there ever an excuse to enter the question part in English and the answer part in Japanese? I mean, sometimes I&#039;m not sure if I will remember the meaning/writing of a word and this acts as a way to make me recall it. This is probably a big no-no, but I was just wondering whether you think this is an okay thing to do?!

Thanks! Take care!]]></description>
