					<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] This no-abstract-worries thing is a lot like how you ask questions of the Internet. Basically, you w&#8230;. Don&#8217;t ask whether or not a problem can be solved, ask how to solve a specific problem and be prepared to pay for high-quality answers. Don&#8217;t learn &#8220;how to cook&#8221;, make one (and only one) dish for dinner tonight. Don&#8217;t solve &#8220;world hunger&#8221; (a stupid phrase if ever there was one). Feed and love this one kid &#8212; and only this one kid &#8212; now. [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[last week I realized an acquaintance still sucks at Japanese despite being a teacher, therefore, the teacher&#039;s learning/teaching methods must not work. (the students who learn by watching anime/reading manga surpass the teacher at reading kanji.) number one thing this teacher is doing right is not using a textbook. in the ESL world we like &quot;authentic material&quot; and it works for any language. I like education reform - especially when it comes to language learning. if I can&#039;t teach you to have a natural conversation or read and understand クレヨンしんちゃん, what&#039;s fun about studying Japanese?? if your level is around intermediate/B2, you should be using an English-English dictionary and able to watch tv without subtitles at my school. same goes for learners of any language.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like the first point, and it seems to apply to more than just language learning.

Sometimes, I feel the need to Google something like, &quot;How to be happy&quot; or, &quot;How to think positively&quot; or even, &quot;How to become motivated/productive&quot;. On occasion I will find something interesting (which will lead to a more specific follow up search) but usually, I&#039;ll come to the conclusion that the answer to my self-improvement question must come from within.

What I mean is, only I know what will work for me. The Internet can give me some fresh ideas/suggestions, but when it comes to how effective they are, only I can accurately gauge that for myself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you ask the internet (especially the learning Chinese brigade) if ANYTHING will work, they tell you it won&#039;t. So instead I just have articles of faith. I have zero evidence for them. One day, when they happen, and I have evidence, I&#039;ll tell the internet.

Here they are, for those interested.

Articles of Faith

1. Even if I can&#039;t choose native pronunciation yet, I will be able to, eventually.
2. Listening to music won&#039;t ruin my tones.
3. The tones will one day 「split out」, just as the non-tonal sounds did.
4. Language-feeling will come, eventually.
5. Material relevant to the things I want to say will eventually show up in the immersion environment.
6. You can trust and mimic FUNBUN that has been translated into Chinese from another language.
7. Something valuable is happening when I read something I only partially follow.
8. I can pick up a massive adult vocabulary without SRSing absolutely everything. It will go in somehow.

(A few things used to be on the list, then they happened:

* I will get native handwriting, eventually, somehow.
* The character elements will 「blend together」, eventually, somehow.
* The sounds will 「split out」.
* The grammar will stop sounding weird.
* I&#039;ll start thinking in Mando.
* I&#039;ll read a comic with 100% one day.
* I&#039;ll follow the plot in a novel one day.

and countless others)

So yeah, next time you have a doubt, make it an Article, and promise to check if you still doubt it 365 days hence. You almost certainly won&#039;t. If you still do, well, maybe you were right, or maybe you need more time.

I know *exactly* what the internet would tell me if I asked about any of the above, so why bother asking?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the second part, wouldn&#039;t you still need to have some knowledge of grammar to be able to understand what you&#039;re reading? I don&#039;t mean sitting down and drilling all those verb endings and particles etc., just... reading through a guide or a textbook just to know what each ending/particle/whatever does, in general, just to be aware this stuff exists so you won&#039;t be utterly confused when you run into it in the wild. 

I use &quot;just&quot; far too often.

But anyway, that was sort of how I learned English. I, like every kid, started with classes at school which gave me enough background to be able to sorta understand what I&#039;m reading (with a lot of assistance) and then I discovered the internet, anime (w/ English subs) and video games and it went from there.]]></description>
