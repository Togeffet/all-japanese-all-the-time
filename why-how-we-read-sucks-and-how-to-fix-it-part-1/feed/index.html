					<description><![CDATA[That is so right. My teachers will ask me every single word on the page and if I can&#039;t give the meaning of the word, she&#039;ll give a very thick book and tell me to search every word that I don&#039;t understand. It was horrible.

But I can say that I still read all the time, and I skim every book I read. Only after I finished the book and find it quite good will I then read the book again in detail.]]></description>

I think that would be a great way to get people to donate too!  you could maybe on the front have one of your cartoons and then on the back maybe have in big characters ‚ÄùÂãùÂÖÉ‚Äù with a quote in japanese.  anyways that idea really seemed cool to me and i would proudly wear/support you/your method/your site! please consider it!  by the way keep twittering away; I enjoy reading your little words of witty wisdom.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Drewkie well Khatz may be goal driven but I believe that&#039;s a good thing too.  I seriously believe you can learn Japanese without having a goal.  You must have something if you want to learn Japanese.  So there must be something keeping you attach.  You are right studies have shown that people who write down their goals have a higher chance of suceeding and becoming more successful.  He just wants us to have fun and not be bored.  In some of his posts he says &quot;Dicipline is just remembering what you want&quot; so he gives some ways to do that which is by blocking English websites.  Thrust me people are used to things.  That could be a bad thing or a good thing depending on your situation.  Thrust me if you&#039;ve been doing 6 months Japanese without touching or hearing English for a long time you will be use to it.  Even if you&#039;ve been doing 1 month of Japanese like I have hardcore you will find your mind is changing slowly.  I have just weirdly sometimes me thinking in Japanese like randomly in my head.  Sometimes when I&#039;m speaking in another language i know a Japanese word sometimes slips out for some random reason.  

Also this will lead to isolation.  Espicially if you have a random mind like me.  It doesn&#039;t matter who you are you live in a English society you will be isolated.  It&#039;s not lonely hardcore isolation but it&#039;s more like your being treated differnt.  I have no idea if this will work that should be included for all of you.  I will still do it because I truly believe Khatz learned this way.  I will continue to live on as that proof.  Besides have fun and use common sense.  In some situations in life rarely sometimes you have to defy all logic to make up your own.  That&#039;s how world history was invented.  :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I deliberately buy dipping books (that is, books which don&#039;t have a narrative, where each chapter is stand-alone), so that I can choose what I want to read, and how much, and which topic, without having to feel guilty or getting confused when I find out I&#039;ve skipped the bit about character A&#039;s neurotic breakdown.

I&#039;ve also given up on forcing myself to read to the end of something.  In fact, I have a new rule, whereby if I find myself counting the number of pages until the end of the chapter, then I put the book down, and choose another.

					<description><![CDATA[Seth, since Khatzumoto clearly took a vow of comment-silence a while back (I assume because comments became Q-and-A-tzumoto time), I&#039;ll respond to that with a link to this post,

http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/2008/page/7

Khatzumoto was also too goal-oriented once, but in his teaching style. He taught goal-orientation a little too much, and people reacted the wrong way. Maybe he overcorrected, but I think that&#039;s probably for the better. Nobody will not-learn Japanese by having too much fun and not focusing on a goal. Nobody will walk away hating the language and cursing all the time they wasted watching good anime and reading good manga and listening to good music and reading good websites etc etc. 

But people will focus on the goal too much. They&#039;ll do that all on their own (myself included). I imagine very few people set out to learn Japanese without a goal in mind. We all want fluency. Khatz deliberately steers us away* from that mindset and to a mindset that guarantees language acquisition, even if it&#039;s not on a perfect timescale. People who work well with goals will cling to their goals and be better for it, and that&#039;s that.


*If it weren&#039;t for the fact that I can cite sources there, I&#039;d definitely feel like a preacher for the Church of AJATT after writing that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[hmmm i don&#039;t know if anyone interested in going beyond the initial 2042 kanji needed for Japanese or not. I already did up to 3007 and up to 1800 sentences. But hmm i might want to try and go up to 6000 kanji cuz i surfing the net and found kanji kentai http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_kentei

Anyhow it tests for 6000 kanji!!!!. To be honest one of the reasons i want to go far and learn the meanings/writing of them all is cuz i want to head towards manadarin/cantonese after japanese. Since they all use the same characters knowing large amounts would be easy to transfer over once I&#039;ve reached a good level in Japanese. But i think for the kanji kentai you need to know large amounts of vocab. in order to use the kanji past 2042 so hmm. I guess it&#039;s best for ppl to learn how to use initial 2042 then head towards 3007 then beyond. I heard that are university graduates in china know around 5000-6000 characters. This is standard there but in japanese knowing this amount would lead to high levels of reading/writing as well. But i also read that heisig i think is going to make 4000+ characters and ultimate goal of 10,000 characters. But first things first get fluent in japanese!!! then learn wayyy moreeee characters!!!]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>hmmm i don&#8217;t know if anyone interested in going beyond the initial 2042 kanji needed for Japanese or not. I already did up to 3007 and up to 1800 sentences. But hmm i might want to try and go up to 6000 kanji cuz i surfing the net and found kanji kentai <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_kentei" class="autohyperlink">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_kentei</a></p>
<p>Anyhow it tests for 6000 kanji!!!!. To be honest one of the reasons i want to go far and learn the meanings/writing of them all is cuz i want to head towards manadarin/cantonese after japanese. Since they all use the same characters knowing large amounts would be easy to transfer over once I&#8217;ve reached a good level in Japanese. But i think for the kanji kentai you need to know large amounts of vocab. in order to use the kanji past 2042 so hmm. I guess it&#8217;s best for ppl to learn how to use initial 2042 then head towards 3007 then beyond. I heard that are university graduates in china know around 5000-6000 characters. This is standard there but in japanese knowing this amount would lead to high levels of reading/writing as well. But i also read that heisig i think is going to make 4000+ characters and ultimate goal of 10,000 characters. But first things first get fluent in japanese!!! then learn wayyy moreeee characters!!!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I just had an idea Katsumoto, and that&#039;s that people are generally on two poles in terms of character and study.  Those that are too hard on themselves, always thinking of practical ways to improve, and in the end never having any fun, never getting anywhere.

There are the others that have no problem having fun, but tend to be not &#039;goal focused&#039;, so they don&#039;t get anywhere as fast as the might if they were more goal oriented, more practical.

The ideal student is someone who is goal oriented, always pushes their self, but also is always easy on their self, and always has fun.

You&#039;re always pushing the &#039;have fun&#039;  but you should push the goal oriented stuff too.  I think some percentage of people want guidance in that realm.]]></description>
