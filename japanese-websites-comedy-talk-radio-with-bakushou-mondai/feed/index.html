					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto

I originally saw a video clip of you hanging out with TkyoSam, and then I saw you again talking about your method of learning Japanese and just submerging yourself into everything  Japanese. 

You&#039;re method really makes sense to me, so I&#039;m going to use it and hopefully it&#039;ll work for me too. I listen to Japanese music on youtube, and just now I started playing the podcast of Bakushou Mondai Cowboy. 

I have been looking for Japanese radio shows online to listen to, but on Windows media player, all I find are anime radio stations, or stock market radio, and there&#039;s only so much of that I can listen to haha. I know you said that Japanese radio can be hard to find, but if you know of any could you please suggest other radio stations online that I can check out so I can spice up my listening. 

Also, do you think my North American radio will work in Japan? Or would I be better off purchasing a Japanese radio when I move?

Arigatou

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah...this whole, &quot;but is it masculine/feminine?&quot; thing that has so many Japanese learners worried is nothing but premature optimization. Yes, there is that guy who learned from his girlfriend, but first we need to worry about whether it&#039;s Japanese or not. You need to build the house of Japanese first. The color of the tablecloth in the dining room (i.e. the gender style of speech) can wait till last.

Interestingly, in the TV drama „Ç±„Ç§„Çæ„ÇØ, the head of the investigative section, a middle-aged man, has a young (20-something?) girlfriend. And, because of all the time he spends with her, his speech at work sometimes has inappropriately youthful or feminine slang and Ë™ûÂ∞æ...but...why am I telling you this?

Anyway, build the house first. When it&#039;s time to pick tablecloths, because you know Japanese, you&#039;ll know what color to pick.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah, ok.
I know the difference between girl&#039;s speech and guy&#039;s but I tend to copy what I hear in Japanese for practice regardless if I understand it all, so I was just a little worried that I might pick it up. 
Thanks for calming my fears and thank you for your great website!
It&#039;s my favorite Japanese learning blog.
(I don&#039;t usually comment on blogs much but since I&#039;m a big fan of your site,
I figured I&#039;d give it a try. )]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Rin
I wouldn&#039;t worry about it. As in English, there are speech forms/styles that are primarily masculine and primarily feminine, but, there is also a healthy middle ground. Masculine speech in Japanese is mostly grunts („ÅÇ„ÅÇ,„Åä„ÅÜ, Âà•„Å´Ôºâ; feminine speech is mostly squealing („Çè„ÉºÔºÅ„Åô„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Åî„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„ÅÑÔºÅ, Êó•Êú¨Ë™û‰∏ä„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„ÉºÊâã„ÅÜ„ÅÜ„ÅÜÔºÅ, „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÅÜ„ÅÜ„ÅÜ„ÅÜ„ÅÜÔºÅÔºâ. Both are stoopid, IMHO. As a girl, just stick to ÁßÅ and limit the number of „Åûs and „Åús in your Ë™ûÂ∞æs and you&#039;re golden. [Having said that, in certain dialects, both men and women use ‰ø∫ 8) ]. Anyway, enough theory! Let&#039;s all quit worrying and listen to the show! No need to bracket or limit your Japanese...just focus on enjoying yourself.

I mean, even if one were to have the wrong gender speech style, which you won&#039;t, but even &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you were to pick it up, on a scale of 1 to 10, Japanese that has native-like accent and word usage but the wrong gender still earns a 9. There are tomboys and ÂÉïÂ∞ëÂ•≥ in Japan, too.]]></description>

They have the same thing in American Amazon....$0.01 books.

When you sell something over amazon, amazon credits you $3.99 for regular shipping. So these people have some way to ship very cheaply, and make money off of the shipping credit Amazon gives them.

I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s a way to bundle used things from the same user for saving shipping costs, but typically since you will buy each item individualized you will pay shipping cost times how many items you buy.

So the 1 yen used mangas would be great if you could buy a ton of them and pay 500 yen shipping for them all, but I think you have to pay the shipping for each of them so it&#039;s just cheaper to buy it used at the bookstore (or get it new for the same price...)

(Selling back college books is a great way to learn about Amazon&#039;s auction system!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This doesn&#039;t really have anything to do with your post, but just a quick question.. when you&#039;re putting definitions for words that you don&#039;t understand in your srs, do you think that you should put all definitions for a word, if say, there are four or so, or just the ones which are relevant to the sentence that you&#039;re trying to understand? So far I have just been putting the ones relevant to the sentence, but I&#039;m not sure whether this is the best way to do it or not...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to say some more things like:
When I‚Äôm listening to japanese music, sometimes I begin not to understand it but to follow the sounds almost fluently and sometimes even without a single break. Did it ever happen to you? 
Everytime it happens, it inspires me to go further and then comes my brother to watch TV **CONFLICT**. Also, about my english, I think you may not remember but I said it was due to many subbed movies, songs and will to speak english. As that kind of material here is almost if not free(on TVs and Radios), I just had to get my ears working and my eyes pointing to the right textual input. But with japanese, it‚Äôs been a little more difficult, though not impossible, for example, I managed to get 333 MB of japanese music and some GB of anime. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going for it. It‚Äôs my dream since I was 8, damn it. It‚Äôs not too late although I‚Äôm 19 by now, right? Well, see you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oops, I think I posted two comments in the wrong place, so I&#039;m posting again:
&quot;Wow, thanks Khatz! I didn‚Äôt know I had such a great chance(some 60% based on their student-master culture) of success. Well, the people I found here are near my house so I hope they accept the suggestion. However, they look busy but yep, my brother said that once, one of them got out for a lunch while reading the ‚ÄúDomingo(sunday)‚Äù newspaper. It could mean that at least one of them is trying to learn portuguese. To be honest, I was thinking about talking to them today, but I was waiting for your reply to see if it was correct. My father doesn‚Äôt even want to know about Japan but kept reading some magazines about Japan I had brought from the ambassade for 3 HOURS. I don‚Äôt really understand him but I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm going and that‚Äôs all. My brothers aren‚Äôt going to collaborate either as the computer is near the TV, **Conflict**. So, I began thinking about all possibilities(almost scientifically), and this one came up. I‚Äôll let you know about the result.&quot;]]></description>
