					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatzumoto,
Thank you for the correction (and I also like when people point out the karate kid thing &quot;Your the best! AROUND!&quot;)  I never put it together that 優しい and 易しい were two different words.  Perhaps they share the same やまとことば.  This book comes to mind, one I was thinking about purchasing:

http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%B2%E3%82%89%E3%81%8C%E3%81%AA%E3%81%A7%E3%82%88%E3%82%81%E3%81%B0%E3%82%8F%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%AE%E3%81%B5%E3%81%97%E3%81%8E-%E4%B8%AD%E8%A5%BF-%E9%80%B2/dp/4093874522/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1221792687&#038;sr=8-1

とにかく、ナチュラルと易しいとは反対じゃないと思う。もちろん、大人の会話に使える表現と親子の会話のは違うけど、両方とも自然でしょう？ブログの読者たちが日本語の子供だって言ったでしょう！　あるいは、僕だけのレベルは子供と同じだ。。。Anyway, I know you put a lot of work into this site, so you don&#039;t have to humor my requests!

Alec, I was suggesting dual English/Japanese versions.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to say I disagree with Daniel. I&#039;ve been a fan of this blog for a long time but I much prefer the AJATT articles to be in English. No matter how good Khatzumoto&#039;s Japanese undoubtedly is, I&#039;ve never felt comfortable reading Japanese written by foreigners. Also, it&#039;s nice to be able to run through RSS feeds quickly rather than taking the extra time it takes to read Japanese. Furthermore, not all AJATT readers can read Japanese well yet. By writing in English, you&#039;re letting beginners and also students of other languages access your blog. Remember that there are lots of readers here who use and support AJATT for learning Arabic, French and other languages completely unrelated to Japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Danielさん（Karate Kidかっ！！）
コメント、ありがとう御座います。

先ずは訂正。
&gt;優しい
この場合はヤッパリ「易しい」です。変換のミスでしょうね。:)

&gt;前の日本語の記事のような慣用語句いっぱい記事じゃなければ
そうかなぁ。要するに、AJATTの内容を題材にした「リーダー」みたいな奴？
解かりました。検討に入れさせて貰います。

でもね！でもね！でもね！それじゃ、多少日本語のナチュラルさが止む無く失われるだろう？それ、どう思う？

ご意見お願いします！]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to see your blog posts in Japanese.  I&#039;m not going to stoop to presuming how easy it would be to bang out a Japanese version of each post, but I think you could give us a &quot;parent to child&quot; style simplistic Japanese version of many posts that many of us would appreciate (in other words, if they aren&#039;t chock full of slang, many more Japanese learners could appreciate them).  That is not to say I don&#039;t appreciate what you have already done, you really have given us so much already.

日本語で勝元さんのブログを読みたい。他の言語で書くのは難しいかもしれないけど、優しい日本語で書かれた記事は面白いと思うよ。つまり、前の日本語の記事のような慣用語句いっぱい記事じゃなければ、みんなが日本語文章を読みながら勝元さんの知識と教えを学べる。]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would appreciate it if you would do this. I don&#039;t think anyone would hold you accountable if they end up not liking something that you&#039;ve read (Where do you live again?) 

Just like you mentioned, for people outside of Japan (like myself), without being able to walk into a bookstore, it&#039;s hard enough trying to finding reading material that matches one&#039;s interests let alone determining if something is worth buying.

A list like this would at least give us some ideas that we can investigate. Speaking of the list.......any idea when we&#039;ll see it?]]></description>
