					<description><![CDATA[I do this for Chinese situations by finding a chinesepod lesson on the topic, grab the associated transcript and vocab list, then email myself the vocab list.  During the conversation I&#039;ll keep the email open on my smartphone just in case I need to look a few things up. 

Takes about 2 minutes and saves me at least 5 minutes of fumbling around in the conversation.  Haircuts, pharmacies, buying a phone, getting the house painted - all can be easier if you have 4-5 key words fresh in your mind.  And I find using these words in real life is worth 50 reps in terms of sticking in your mind.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is basically what I tell newbies who are scared of talking to a native speaker for the first time to do prior to their first language exchange (via skype): write down a bunch of questions and statements that you think you might want to use during the conversation and practice saying them before hand (use forvo for any words you&#039;re not sure how to pronounce).  This will make you MUCH less nervous and the call MUCH easier to conduct, primarily because now you&#039;ve completely eliminated the possibility of the &quot;oh god I can&#039;t think of anything to say&quot; nervous silence that everyone&#039;s terrified of.

Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mm, yeah, this is a good idea. I never thought about writing things down and carrying that with. Typically what I&#039;ve done when I know I&#039;ll need to go somewhere new is I&#039;ll do some domain-specific reading (need to pull some money from your overseas bank account? read about banks and cards) and learn the new terminology, but NOT look up the actual information I need, that way I&#039;ll be forced to ask questions and figure things out in person.]]></description>
