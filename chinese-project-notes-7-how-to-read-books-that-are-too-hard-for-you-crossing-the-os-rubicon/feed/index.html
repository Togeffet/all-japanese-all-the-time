					<description><![CDATA[Learning English using katakana sounds pretty interesting, actually. If this Japanese thing doesn&#039;t work out for me, maybe I&#039;ll just try to mess up my English instead.

Anyway...
Khatz, can you recommend any Japanese books on programming? I&#039;m trying to nipponize my personal library, but I just don&#039;t know what to look for. I suppose I could go for translated versions of the books I already have, but even then, I don&#039;t know their Japanese titles. orz]]></description>

It&#039;s me once more. (Sorry)
I was wondering, how did you learn the tones? Were they hard for you? I cannot find an effective way to learn or remember them.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much! But I have one final question, sorry: 

I was told that it is best if I learn everything other than the characters and save those for last. Is it true? I find that I pick up characters and new words and phrases at the same time just by watching Disney movies, as you did. I believe that I have answered my own question, but would still appreciate your input. Thanks again. C:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I think it would work. I mean, I would follow it; I am following. There are only 3 principles. The Three Laws of Linguistics, if you will:

1. Have fun.
2. Always do stuff in [target language] that agrees with principle 1.
3. Follow principles 1 and 2 all day every day.

The more geeky version goes:

1. A human may not bore herself or allow herself to become bored.
2. A human must read/hear/listen to/speak stuff in her target language, and it may not violate the First Law.
3. The First and Second Laws must both be obeyed, all day, every day. Allowances are made only for situations that would impair your ability to obey the Second Law.]]></description>

I am beginning with Chinese and was wondering if I should follow the same method that you recommend for Japanese.

					<description><![CDATA[@Max
&gt;Can I ask how long it took you to learn the 4280 characters you started with?
It took me a while. At about 2500-3000 I started learning sentences and doing characters at the same time.

&gt;doing the extra 1000 in RTK 3 before going onto sentences
You could if you want. Most people who are done with RTK1 are often raring to go with sentences, but if you want to get those extra kanji now, it wouldn&#039;t be a bad thing at all. Go for it! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Khatz,
  Not sure were to put this but since I see that you are now in Chinese OS territory, you&#039;ve finally conveinced me to swap my safe English OS for an adventurous Japanese OS (all Windows).  My question is somewhat related.  I&#039;m in the IT field and I spend far more time studying for IT certs than studying Japanese.  I figured that I could *theoretically* kill two birds with one stone if I studied for my IT certs in Japanese.  Any thoughts on that?  (I&#039;m mainly looking at the MS stuff and I assume that it would be quite painful at first but get better with time... also, the amount of katakana may lessen the blow).  As always, thank for your inspirational help:)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto,
I&#039;m getting to the finishing stages of RTK 1, and was wondering what you&#039;re opinion was on going ahead and doing the extra 1000 in RTK 3 before going onto sentences. I run into kanji from book 3 pretty often.

					<description><![CDATA[Well, seeing as 漢字 are not foreign to me, my opinion is rather skewed for a 漢字-newb foreigner; I can&#039;t say at all that it works, it just seems to me that way. 

At any rate, any form of the Heisig method is decidedly better than how we native 漢字-users learn new characters at school - by copying rows of characters dozens of times. We take about 10 years of education to master all the common characters, very inefficient compared to the Heisig method. 

Seeing as you, a foreigner who hasn&#039;t had any prior exposure to 漢字 before trying out Heisig&#039;s method, have memorized the shapes and meanings of around 4000 characters with the no-reading method, your opinion is definitely worth more weight for the foreign learner of Chinese/Japanese than mine.]]></description>

Thanks for your comment. I have had many people share that opinion with me...I personally found it easier to do it the Heisig way, even for Chinese, because while there is a stronger sound-character relationship than with Japanese, and fewer multiple-reading characters...there were enough exceptions, enough non-patterns, to make it frustrating (and slower) for me personally to attempt to do readings at the same time.

So, this is me speaking as just one guy, who went from seeming to have 0 chance at Chinese literacy (I failed miserably at my first Chinese class at university because I was fixated on looking for a way to memorize the characters long-term, and not just for the upcoming test), to using a variation of the Heisig method and becoming a kanji nerd, able to understand, write and read characters of arbitrary number and complexity. If Heisig&#039;s method can be said to be a divide-and-conquer approach, then his was the division that worked best for me: one adult with no strong phonetic associations with Chinese or Japanese at the time.

However, like you said, it may well be not be that much of a stretch to learn reading and meaning together, and I would join you in recommending that any curious person give it a try: they may be pleasantly surprised. Some people have also suggested learning a single kun-yomi reading while learning characters in the Heisig way for Japanese...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reading shounen manga and children&#039;s books are also very helpful for learning readings, since furigana are on most of the kanji.

Just my 2yen but honestly speaking, as a native speaker of Mandarin, I think that learning the reading of a  Chinese character at the same time as its meaning is not that much of a stretch if you are familiar with the four tones, because Chinese characters on the whole have only 1 reading; those with 2 are usually those with a more archaic reading which is somewhat closer to Middle Chinese, which you probably won&#039;t use in most situtations. e.g. 給与/给予  is ji3yu3 instead of ge3yu2. These words are rather rare though, we don&#039;t have the 呉音・漢音・唐音・訓読み difference in Chinese. This of course, applies but to Chinese, if you&#039;re learning Japanese, I&#039;d say follow the classic Heisig method.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha! Ikari Gendo.
I&#039;m really excited he (and Timothy Richardson) are finally doing it. My only teeny, tiny complaint is that they only do 3000 chars total...plus, the first book is only coming out with 1500 chars or something...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello khatzumoto!  

So whats your opinion about the new hanzi books Commander Heisig is publishing?

(...you once mentioned that you mentally picture James Heisig as being black.  For some reason, I always picture him as being Gendo Ikari.  That&#039;s why I address him as Commander Heisig.)

Bye bye!]]></description>
