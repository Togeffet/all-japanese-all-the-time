					<description><![CDATA[Addendum: Yes, we can manipulate our beliefs via an SRS, but if we still haven&#039;t achieved that coveted state of eudemonia, you can bet that either our flashcards suck or we simply haven&#039;t flashcarded our way through the right insights yet. No amount of repetition will fix that fact that we aren&#039;t repeating the right stuff yet. 

Oh boy... that can&#039;t be good for those of us already struggling with SRS addiction... or hooker and blow addiction. The H&#038;B thing is still a gasser for me every time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Learned a few new words thanks to this article...always a pleasure reading Khatz&#039; blog. 

Way off topic, but an element of the reasoning behind this article I think might have to do with why I and some other people have had problems engaging with traditional religion as it was foisted upon us when we were young. For me it was Christianity...always you would hear that it&#039;s your *choice to believe* in Jesus or whatever other deity. 

Really? I don&#039;t think we have so much control over our own perceptions, appraisals of the world around us. We can&#039;t very well choose what to believe in...that&#039;s nonsense. We believe in whatever we are most convinced of. In a way, the insight that we encounter has true authority over how we perceive and evaluate the world around us, as long as remember that insight. No matter what we profess with our lips or keyboards, our behavior day-to-day truly reflects what we most believe in.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha ... I can relate to this.
