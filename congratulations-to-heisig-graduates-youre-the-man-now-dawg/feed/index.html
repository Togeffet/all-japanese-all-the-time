					<description><![CDATA[Khatz. I first saw you through Sam. (You know Sam) It was 2008. I liked what you had to say in his 3 part video. I just never took the initiative to learn. Welp. It&#039;s been a week and 3 days and I&#039;ve been a mad man. I know both Hiragana and Katakana from memory and JUST started RTK 2 days ago. I&#039;m at 350 Kanji. Adding to the chaos, the only thing that keeps me sane is the progress. I&#039;m NOWHERE near fluent, but the fact that when I watched Japan&#039;s 2004 film, &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; after a week into this immersion program, I began to hysterically laugh because I understood the majority of the movie and what was being said. How? Well let&#039;s put it this way, this is the most English I&#039;ve experienced this past week. I surround myself with nothing BUT Japanese. I listen to Japanese music, watch Japanese anime (ENTIRE DragonBall series is coming in the mail soon) Japanese movies, also the Youtuber &quot;Megwin&quot; and the Marimoeo ladies from Hokkaido. I&#039;d like to say thank you to both yourself and Sam. I&#039;ll see you in Japan in the next 3-4 years...u_u...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, I&#039;ve been reading AJATT since May, and just wanted to let you know that I&#039;ve completed RTK1 and kana, and am now doing sentences. I don&#039;t think I could have gotten this far without the advice on this site. I adapted a lot of it and developed my own method a little differently, but the core of it came from here.
So thanks, Khatz. Maybe one day I&#039;ll see you in Êó•Êú¨ and buy you a „Éì„Éº„É´„ÄÇ :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been learning Japanese for almost eight years, but have always had trouble with writing kanji. I have some questions for those learning &#062;10 kanji/day.

1. Do you create your own mnemonics? 

(I use [most of] Heisig&#039;s primitives/keywords, but I create my own mnemonics. It&#039;s quite time consuming. Creating 10 mnemonics can take 15-45 min. The most I ever created in one day was 50, and I was at it for about five hours. This is why I&#039;m curious of the methods of those who learn &#062;100/day.)

2. Do you make flashcards by hand, use an app, e.g., Anki, or just follow what&#039;s in RtK1 and don&#039;t write anything?

(I use Rtk1 + Anki + Kanji Koohi [if I can&#039;t create a vivid mnemonic; creating them yourself sticks the best])

***

I was able to read manga, elem. and some middle school textbooks before starting RtK1. It took me about six months to clear 2000 kanji with my above method (avg. 10/day). I haven&#039;t studied nor reviewed the mnemonics I&#039;ve created, but I&#039;ve retained a good portion of them. I can&#039;t wait to review all 2042! I&#039;m scheduled to finish them this week! I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll fly through more than 100/day.

Thanks, Khatz. All the best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was able to finish both RTK I and III... it took me a bit less than a year, but I did it. And on January of this year, I stoped reviewing... which is something I truly regret. Now, if I want to get into Japanese again, I have to start all over again... form scratch... from kanji 1...

In short: NEVER-STOP-REVIEWING!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Barmack, a lot of that info is in other posts, if you want a &quot;table of contents&quot; of most of the meat of this blog you can check here: http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency

the answer to your on/kun question is that once you finish working with RTK1, you start the sentence drilling phase, which is where you start to pickup the readings.

					<description><![CDATA[1681 Kanji and counting. Schoolwork is robbing my time, but I think given one or two more weeks and I can join the ranks of Phase 4: Sentences. I&#039;ve been anticipating it every single day. And, it&#039;s served as a form of motivation for me, as well. (That&#039;s right, more Japanese serves as motivation to do Japanese. Goooood stuff).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been studying Japanese for a couple of years, and I&#039;d say I knew about 750 kanji before I stumbled onto this site the other day. The second I got Anki, I went a little crazy with RTK.

Crazy = I did 500 the first day, haha.

It kind of sucked cause I had 300 to review today, but I&#039;ve already learned so much, and even with a huge number like that, I&#039;m remembering at least 75%. I&#039;ve slowed it down to 150 per day, and it&#039;s not that bad.

Also, Khatz, I took your advice, and I put Oprah (my Oprah radical is Ëé´) into my stories. Now, Êº†, Ê®°, ËÜú, and Êë∏ are so much easier to remember :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally, I found that the Heisig method just wasnt working for me and so have changed gears a little in that regards. I picked up a book called Essential Kanji, by PG O&#039;Neil. The kanji are organized in such a way that you will never see a compound made up of characters you have not yet seen which you can then create sample sentences from for practice. My one complaint is that readings are given in romaji.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sup khatzumoto!  Just wanna say that you&#039;re an awesome inspiration and a great guide in my learning journey.  You keep me going man and I appreciate that to a huge degree.  But man 100 kanji a day!?  Damn I&#039;ve been doing like 20-25... guess I should step it up!!  My only concern is what comes after this, the sentences...  I feel that it&#039;s going to be difficult to do, tracking down sentences that I hope are helpful..yare yare...  O well I&quot;ll worry about that as soon as I cross this bridge!  And I&#039;ll give you a donation for sure (just as soon as I get this whole japanese language thing down pat ;)  Thx for everything man you rock!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[WTF! reading those stories makes my adrenaline rush so badly, that i begin to shake of desire to learn kanji -_-;; 

I&#039;ve known about heisig ever since i started learning Japanese, but only began reading this site this week. I&#039;ve had the Heisig book on my PC for months I had this SRS for months and never used it. WTF! 

I never did because i was anxious about getting wrong meanings and confusion when learning new kanji that don&#039;t show up in heisig. But i guess that, when you&#039;re done, and are well into the japanese sentences bit you don&#039;t need to make up stories anymore because then the new kanji wil be so special that you remember them and their readings anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, so.... if i learned kanji with heisig at roughly 1.7 - 2.0 wans would that be good or bad? It seems to be a super fast method, I only work three days a week and i&#039;m on summer break from college so ihave loooooooaaaaaadddds of free time. I&#039;ll become the kanji demon, maybe if I keep my motivation I can become the sentence demon too!!! Also on another note, I had the idea from your site about SRS devices, in the way that I could employ it to helping my friend learn his music theory. I think it would work do you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just finished Heisig&#039;s RTK1. Now on to RTK3 and real sentences(which I have been cheating and doing a little of anyway).  I wanted to tell the world.  So, I am telling this forum.  Thanks Khatz! You have already improved my Japanese AND Mandarin.]]></description>
