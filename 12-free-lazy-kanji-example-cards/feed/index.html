					<description><![CDATA[So Khatz; I&#039;ve been working with this method for a few days now, but　now I realized that with all those Kanji-Methods I&#039;d never actually learn how to say the things I&#039;ll then be able to read.
So I get what the Kanji&#039; mean, but then I have no idea how to actually say them without looking up the romaji version of the word.

What I basically mean by that that I have no way of connecting spoken japanese (like in a podcast/radio) and written japanese (books, websites). Only thing I could imagine is getting subtitles to everything watched, but there aren&#039;t many Anime transcripted to japanese (as seen in your list of correctly subbed Anime) or podcasts like that.
Did I miss something important on the way here?

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062; Speaking of mnemonic stories, RevTK/RevTH is a treasure trove of those! KanjiDamage is pretty sweet, too.

Personally, I don&#039;t recommend taking other people&#039;s stories. Maybe it&#039;s just that I only ever found the bad ones, but I rarely came across one as memorable as the ones I came up with myself. Sure it was more time consuming, but it was time enjoyably spent (I still laugh every time I get a rep for 創, as it makes me think of somalian pirates performing a raid and only getting genesis CDs :P). Besides, you&#039;ll eventually need to do it when you inevitably come across a kanji not covered in RTK (e.g. 臍).]]></description>
