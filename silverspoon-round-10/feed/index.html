					<description><![CDATA[How many hours daily does SS take? Is it possible to do it for a busy (and I mean it) university student? By daily hours I mean those hours that you&#039;re only learning japanese, not hours spent doing something else with japanese immersion (because I suppose number of the latter would be around 24 ;) ).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&gt;can I change my plan afterwards?
You can

&gt;If I try either the daily or monthly plan for a few days and decide it&#039;s not for me, I ask for a cancellation, will I not get a refund until after 1.5 years??
That is correct. So, if you&#039;re on the fence, I&#039;d recommend holding off on joining for now and waiting for whatever round is running when you&#039;re feeling more certain :D .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi

I&#039;m confused about each option plan.

If I sign up for the monthly option, and I decide that I&#039;d rather pay for the Full package, can I change my plan afterwards?

If I try either the daily or monthly plan for a few days and decide it&#039;s not for me, I ask for a cancellation, will I not get a refund until after 1.5 years??  

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found someone blogging about SS, but they aren&#039;t too far into it and aren&#039;t consistent with their posts.  Might be worth a look.  I&#039;ll post more if I find them.  And I&#039;ll be posting about it on my blog as well.

					<description><![CDATA[So...I assume this is making money since you&#039;re up to round 10 now.  Cool!

I am...far too cheap for this.  Additionally, I&#039;m making my way through the Kanji at my typical snail&#039;s pace, and feel confident that, although it will take me longer than, uh, everyone else, I&#039;ll finally get this Japanese thing down on my own.  

...glad to see you making money, though!  :D]]></description>
