					<description><![CDATA[If you ask the internet (especially the learning Chinese brigade) if ANYTHING will work, they tell you it won&#039;t. So instead I just have articles of faith. I have zero evidence for them. One day, when they happen, and I have evidence, I&#039;ll tell the internet.

Here they are, for those interested.

Articles of Faith

1. Even if I can‚Äôt choose native pronunciation yet, I will be able to, eventually.
2. Listening to music won‚Äôt ruin my tones.
3. The tones will one day ‚Äúsplit out‚Äù, just as the non-tonal sounds did.
4. Language-feeling will come, eventually.
5. Material relevant to the things I want to say will eventually show up in the immersion environment.
6. You can trust and mimic FUNBUN that has been translated into Chinese from another language.
7. Something valuable is happening when I read something I only partially follow.
8. I can pick up a massive adult vocabulary without SRSing absolutely everything. It will go in somehow.

(A few things used to be on the list, then they happened:

* I will get native handwriting, eventually, somehow.
* The character elements will &quot;blend together&quot;, eventually, somehow.
* The sounds will &quot;split out&quot;.
* The grammar will stop sounding weird.
* I&#039;ll start thinking in Mando.
* I&#039;ll read a comic with 100% one day.
* I&#039;ll follow the plot in a novel one day.

and countless others)

So yeah, next time you have a doubt, make it an Article, and promise to check if you still doubt it 365 days hence. You almost certainly won&#039;t. If you still do, well, maybe you were right, or maybe you need more time.

I know *exactly* what the internet would tell me if I asked about any of the above, so why bother asking?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post. I guess maybe to add a bit, perhaps learning how to use the tools (ie the method) could be equally important. Bookmarklets may be powerful tools, but if I don&#039;t know how to use them, I&#039;m still kind of stuck.

PS The site is wider O.O Other than subtle changes to the nav, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever witnessed a change to AJATT&#039;s layout..]]></description>
