					<description><![CDATA[Aron, are The Ultimate Word List books still available? Amazon says they&#039;re out of print. I was planning to start with the one for Spanish. I do already have a list of common words that I got for free, but I think the way you present it in your book would be more helpful than working from a plain text document with no translations.
BTW, for the folks who were looking for a Frequency List of Japanese words, Wiktionary has lists of most common words for over 30 languages, including Japanese. See &#039;Wiktionary:Frequency_lists&#039; at http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists

					<description><![CDATA[I went through about 2,500 words(and example sentences)religiously from a frequency dictionary for Portuguese. And while it certainly wasn&#039;t as much fun as native material, by the time I&#039;d finished I found that all the native material I looked at was so much more accessible and enjoyable. Personally, I find it really hard to resist looking up words I don&#039;t know in native material, which takes the fun out in itself. So, spending a few months cramming the boring high-frequency dictionary  sentences was like an investment in increased fun later on... I found the fun-cost you talked about was worth it. And I&#039;m doing the same thing in my next language (French).

I&#039;m Aron.  I don&#039;t have Hindi (yet), but there might be something for it in the future.  I have some additional stuff in mind for the future that I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;ll all love.  Plus it might be free.  We&#039;ll see.

					<description><![CDATA[Is there any way I can have Aron&#039;s email?  I am looking for this type of book in Hindi.  I see he has many other titles but I am specifically looking for a Hindi book of word frequency lists.  Maybe this would not be so useful for Japanese but for any other language it is extremely useful.

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That actually reminds me of a little set of programs I wrote to help me study.  It downloads a few hundred pages from the yomiuri shimbun (usually totaling around a megabyte worth of text when the stories have been parsed out), then it uses the periods at the ends of sentences as delimiters to break up that megabyte or so into usually around 100,000 sentences or so.  Then it runs my sentence database through Jim Breen&#039;s edict dictionary to count what &quot;patterns&quot; are used in my sentences and then it does the same for every sentence from the aggregate webpage.  Then it uses that to figure out how many new &quot;patterns&quot; are in each sentence and it organizes the sentences based on that.  In addition, it does a similar type of comparison with my kanji database.  Only, with the kanji, it counts &#039;unfamiliar&#039; kanji.  An unfamiliar kanji is currently defined as one that has either not been &#039;activated&#039; yet or which has a prescribed delay of less than 30 days.

To keep a short story short, my programs spend a few hours downloading webpages, delimiting them into sentences, and cross-referencing that aggregate with my sentence and kanji databases to produce a list that is sorted primarily by the number of new words and secondarily by the number of new kanji and it&#039;s all presented in a nice html page so I can use RikaiChan.  : )

					<description><![CDATA[While I fully support any product that will help people learn Japanese, I have to criticize the concept of a frequency list from a standpoint of what I think are &quot;the principles of ajatt.&quot; In brief, I think that what you ought to learn, and in what order is a hugely complex issue that comes down to much more than statistical word frequency.

For instance, I have a friend who&#039;s learning Japanese basically so he can read OnePiece (a comic about pirates). To him, learning the word 海賊 かいぞく [pirate] is probably more important than learning the word 経済 けいざい [economy], despite the latter being more common in Japanese, generally. The reason you should learn a word is not simply because it&#039;s common, but because it is interesting to you. The reason you learn a sentence is not just because it is in Japanese, but because the content and meaning of the sentence is interesting.

One of the great things about AJATT and using native media as a primary study tool, imo, is the opportunity to discover Japanese for yourself, which gives the language intrinsic value and meaning to you. This opportunity cannot be engendered by a set of words and grammar structures spoon-fed to you out of context from a textbook or a teacher that merely is there to study &quot;because it is Japanese.&quot; In other words, the search for words and grammar that have meaning to you, parsing the wheat from the chaff, is an important part of learning how to read. Using and reading real Japanese is not only the end goal, it is also the means to achieving that goal.

In practice, though, the majority of the first several hundred words will be in high usage regardless of the media, and in fact using native media can quite difficult at the beginning of the sentence phase. (Or maybe I should say, it&#039;s tough to find good media that is appropriate for beginners) I would guess that a resource such as this could be helpful for people in the under-500 ish sentence range, but I would encourage people to wean themselves off bland lists of words, sentences and characters (i&#039;m lookin at you, Heisig) as early as possible and start learning to read things that are fun to you regardless of how unacademic or useless they might seem. (pokemon anyone?) Its about the journey not the destination! 

In brief, I worry that people will use a book like this less as a reference and more as a &quot;heisig for words&quot; learning every one religiously until they reach the end. This may achieve some literacy, but at what cost? The cost of the fun that comes with engaging with native media.

fwiw,
Tommy]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I agree. I think you could do a lot better with $30 than on a frequency list. I honestly would rather pay for two months of AJATT+, a much higher value per dollar. I just think that it should be seen, as you said, as another tool to use, not the &quot;wrong tool&quot;.

Sorry, I&#039;ll stop typing. I don&#039;t know why but it just pieved me with all the negativity. Sometime negativity is very good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think this is necessarily a bad book.  I just think it&#039;s solving a problem that doesn&#039;t exist in Japanese.  With most languages, there&#039;s no definite priority-sort for words; there&#039;s no big, glowing sign saying &quot;literacy begins here&quot;.  Japanese, for better or worse, does have this:  the General-Use Kanji.  And Heisig presents a far more complete method of getting there than this does.

If this book handled compounds, or contained example sentences, it would be more useful in the context of AJATT.  It can still be used, as Branden pointed out upthread, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s worth $30.  Were I learning any other language this series covers (especially one without Roman script) it&#039;d be quite useful though.]]></description>
