					<description><![CDATA[I seem to have been experiencing &#039;burn out&#039; with Japanese recently so I came across this article while looking for articles that reference this issue.
Although I never really get &#039;bored&#039;, I have suddenly had a case of brain fog and tiredness, and I got the feeling my brain had started resisting the language. I think reason 1 and 2 are spot on, that is &quot;They listen to the target language dutifully but indiscriminately&quot; and &quot;When they do find something they like, they repeat it beyond enjoyment&quot;

I&#039;ve been repeating episodes a LOT. The method I&#039;ve been using is to look up all the words of an episode and repeat it over and over throughout the day. At first this was exciting as I was learning so many new words in such a short time, and as I generally don&#039;t get bored I figured I could handle any amount of repetition. However, once I had learned a few episodes, it became a bit of a burden to maintain, having to routinely watch the same things for so long.

As I really wanted to assure the vocabulary I learned would stick, I kept repeating even after it was no longer stimulating. While repetition is important, so is quantity/variety of exposure - if you&#039;re getting enough quantity you should be able to afford to leave some things behind (they&#039;ll catch up with you soon enough).

Glad I read this article today. Brings me back to the basics - just show up. Simples.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was thinking last night that it would be really cool if I had a book full of Japanese word searches. That way, you would remember which kanji and kana make up this one word and which ones make up this other word, and you would also learn to recognize kanji and kana even if you didn&#039;t know what they mean (yet).I don&#039;t know if there are books stuffed with Japanese word searches, but they probably exist. They&#039;d better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I kinda did that with english, a couple of years ago, and it was a great things.
I still watch several series cause I love it and want to keep pratice listening.
I wanna learn japanese now, I&#039;ve watched some doramas, so I plan now to watch more doramas and animes than I watch series :)
I don&#039;t want to stop all at once with my favorites american series, but I can do both right? 
But I must confess I&#039;m still kinda lost to where to start with japanese... I learned the hiragana and katakana, but I don&#039;t have vocabulary at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before you&#039;ve finished kanji, reading is not your priority.  Start learning them right now; the format doesn&#039;t really matter, the important part is to do them.  The sooner you start, the sooner you&#039;ll be through them.  (And screw what Khatz suggests, try everything and go with what YOU like.  Invent your own format.  It&#039;s your learning, own it.)
 
Until you&#039;re done, focus on listening for your immersion.  Youtube videos (雑談 -- lit. miscellaneous conversation -- is a good general search term), music, anime (Crunchyroll streams a lot of series for free; the more recent ones even have removable subtitles.)  Just have stuff on in the background; it really does help, I promise.  LOOK at books, and manga, and whatever, but until you&#039;ve at least most of the way through the kanji, don&#039;t expect much.  (Oh, and FWIW, even with the head-start your reading skills will probably catch up to and surpass your listening pretty quickly once you start.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(I&#039;m going to assume you&#039;ve learned the kanji.  If not, get on that and don&#039;t worry too much about written immersion until you&#039;re done.)

Start with your dictionary.  Look up what you&#039;re interested in, find out the Japanese term for it.  (Alternately, look it up on Wikipedia and use the sidebar to go to the equivalent Japanese article.)  Take that term and google it.  So, for example, I&#039;m a guitarist.  Searching ”ギター　ブログ” returns about 30 million hits.  From there, it&#039;s just a matter of sorting the wheat from the chaff.

As for not understanding it... well, that&#039;s kind of the point.  Let go of the need for 100% comprehension or you&#039;re going to be very bored.  Find a sentence you *almost* understand.  Break it down, learn all the readings, learn what it means, and stick it in your SRS.  Rinse, repeat.  (If you truly don&#039;t understand *anything*, you may need to do some easier stuff first.  I just spent a month working through All About Particles -- not the most interesting material, but I now can more easily learn the stuff I really *want* to learn.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like this idea, but i just dont see how it can be economically viable/time efficient at all . . for me personally i cant watch things over and over without getting bored, and i&#039;m also finding that watching things when i barely understand any of it takes away a lot of the enjoyment, so it has to be something pretty amazing in the first place to hold my attention.
Plus i spend a lot of time obn the web just browsing stupid comedy sites, blogs etc and searching for that kinds of thing in japanese i have no idea where to begin, and dont understand emough to enjoy reading them anyway ... 
So any ideas on where to find an abundance of free/cheap resources ? 
(ps. ive pretty much scoured everything that&#039;s already been suggested on this site in posts and comments! yes i know i should have a ton of stuff from all that, but i am being picky after all :D)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry guys, I was bored on my lunch break in the far future from when the previous post to me was created lol. I remember going through RTK, and one of the ways that I attempted the kanji was to try and &quot;follow everything by the book&quot;. NO. Don&#039;t do it. Following this website &quot;To the T&quot; is honestly NOT the way to go. I&#039;m getting there Khatz if your reading lol just don&#039;t think im EVER putting your site down cause this site is AWSUM. Doing this &quot;by the book&quot; crap honestly wasted probably 4 months of my japanese study. The reason why I say this is because I was going nowhere. I needed way that interested me and kept me upbeat and going further. I liked the IDEA of one day knowing Japanese, but the road ahead of using someone else&#039;s ideas and creativity had to come to an abrupt halt. I had to step back and honestly question how I was carrying on with my study. My SRS reps sucked and I wasn&#039;t remembering much, my attention span sucked unless it was something exciting and interesting and lets face it, most of Heisig&#039;s mnemonics suck to the younger audience.

What I did was almost MANDATORY for me in order to retain the kanji the way that I can now. Every single kanji mnemonic HAD TO BE my own, otherwise it was useless. The whole point of a mnemonic is to associate what you see with a memory, and if the memory is &quot;by the book&quot; like the readings of Heisig&#039;s representation in RTK, then it&#039;s stupid to think that you can use his OWN visulization of that kanji in a way that will work for you.

It really wasn&#039;t much more effort on my part to get this down and done. BUT, I did make flash cards ON PAPER that seemed to work much better than the SRS program at the time. To do this, you need to think like a boring art teacher thinks. You know what I&#039;m talking about, like when thery ask a group or a class &quot;What does this painting really mean to you?&quot; Good question. The same thing applies to a kanji. Look at it and think, do you know of anything that you run into in everyday life or from a vivid memory that LOOKS like the kanji in question? If so, write down the situation that the &quot;kanji&quot; or &quot;look alike memory&quot; is in in plain english. Voila! You have your mnemonic for the kanji. It doesn&#039;t even have to be very long, just so long as you can look at the kanji and remember the situation that your nmemonic describes.

Some kanji will just have to me REMEMBERED because there will be no mnemonic that you can possibly think of or come up with. I actually managed to come up with exactly 1841 personal mnemonic devices for my kanji. But it&#039;s funny when you run into a kanji through your SRS that you somehow REMEMBER doesn&#039;t have a mnemonic, your brain will seem to narrow it down in some magical way that you can remember even the NON-mnemonic kanji faster and more accurately. I dont know, but that is how it works for me.

If I was to add up the time it took me to write the mnemonics down for each kanji, I bet you it would probably end up being 1/16 of the total time of constant blank face memorization. It really paid off in the end.

Through my kanji learning journey, I started with trying Heisig&#039;s mnemonics and it took me about 4 months to have a retention rate of around 700 kanji. But, with my new mnemonic flash cards, I had them written down on paper and entered into an SRS in about 2 months WITH a retention rate of about 1600 round and about.

So I think it paid off, let me know what you guys/Khatz think about this idea.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry guys, I was bored on my lunch break in the far future from when the previous post to me was created lol. I remember going through RTK, and one of the ways that I attempted the kanji was to try and &#8220;follow everything by the book&#8221;. NO. Don&#8217;t do it. Following this website &#8220;To the T&#8221; is honestly NOT the way to go.

					<description><![CDATA[Khaaaaaz Thank yoouuuuu. I AM 16. I wanted to learn japanese so i wanted to go to a japanese school or sumtin. But..... TO HELL WIT TEH SCHOOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1. I read sum of your entries and they got me into learning Japanese NOW. I got that &quot;naaaah ill do that later&quot; stuff outta my head.  I started reading the book last night and i already cought on the first few kanji. Like up to 20 or something I dunno.I&#039;m going to download the SRS now to  see if i really memorized the ones i read on. If anyone had told me there where almost 2000 kanji before I found this blog..... I probably would have slapped em and dropped  this language there and then.  But you have a good way of saying things ;) so i don&#039;t think i&#039;ll be stopping anytime soon.

@Jenny: hmm. Well Jenny i was born bilingual. I know spanish/english. Even though spanish is my native language, i rarely spoke it except for at home. Therefore when i DID speak in spanish it had a very &quot;foreign&quot; accent to it. Now since i moved to the Dom. Rep. my spanish is very nice :) , but my english suffered a bit with the accent.
So what i&#039;m trying to say is if you speak 1 language more than the other, the accent of the one you speak more is bound to stick to the one you speak less. It&#039;s           NOTHING PERMANENT. You say you hardly do anything in your native language anymore; So since you speak and hear so much english that accent is going to be present in your native language.ONLY because your accustomed to speaking so much English. But if you ever start to speak in L1 more than english... Well that accent WILL disappear.Your fluency WILL return (if you&#039;re any less fluent now than you were before). I&#039;m sure of that. Regardless of what language you speak.]]></description>
