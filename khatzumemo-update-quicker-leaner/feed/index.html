					<description><![CDATA[Hello Khatzumoto!
First of all, I want to say that I find your website very inspiring and funny at the same time. You seem like a great person dedicated to helping others succeed like the way you did, which I appreciate more than you can imagine.

Just a suggestion for Khatzumemo- Maybe something that tells you when the next repetitions are due, because I don&#039;t like getting the final screen either =)
If I knew when my next reps were, I&#039;d just come back and do them then. THANK YOU (even if you decide my suggestion is useless, hehe)]]></description>

@Dareru
Depending on the amount of reps that are due for you the next day (i.e. if there are items due the next day), KhatzuMemo *does* allow you to do more.
However, at the stage you&#039;re at now, it may well be the case that all your items have intervals longer than 2 days, in which case KhatzuMemo does not allow you to do more
if only because you don&#039;t *need* to do more. Remember, the idea is *spaced* repetition, not forced drilling by rote -- that was the old way.

So, from the main screen, and also from the &quot;add item&quot; screen KhatzuMemo (if certain conditions are fulfilled) should allow you to do more reps.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;ve been using Khatzumemo on my cellphone for a while since I didn&#039;t have access to a computer.  I recently got access to one and was able to download Mnemosyne.  Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t been able to find a way to transfer files from Khatzumemo to Memosyne...is there a way to do this?  I would like to be able to use both programs (one for online, one for desktop).  Just being able to download my Khatzumemo vocab list as a text file would already make things a lot simpler. 

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto, I&#039;m really sorry my review came off as harsh as it did. Looking back I didn&#039;t mean it to sound that angry, I wrote it after a 15-hour, really stressful workday.

That being said, I still think the ads needed to go, the load times needed to be faster, and you need a link to view stats whenever you want.

I&#039;m really impressed that you responded to criticism so quickly though, and that speaks a lot for Khatzumemo that it will be improved thanks to criticisms of lowly bloggers like me. Thanks for taking the time.

I plan on writing an updated review of Khatzumemo in the next week or two, so show me what you got.

Thanks,
Todd
