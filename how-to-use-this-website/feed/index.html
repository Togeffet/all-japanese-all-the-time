					<description><![CDATA[When my brother saw how quickly my Japanese was improving, he asked me what he should do to learn Chinese. I pointed him to this site. He was like, &quot;There&#039;s a lot here, what should I read?&quot; and I, having never really considered this, gave the stupid, stupid advice to read sections x, x and x of the Table of Contents. Needless to say, he was intimidated by the amount I said he would &#039;have to read&#039; and gave up pretty quickly. 

After I found out he&#039;d given up, I realised what I&#039;d done: I&#039;d taken all the fun out of it. When I found this site I was thrilled! I hadn&#039;t been exposed to any kind of really &#039;out-there&#039; learning methods before and was having a blast just reading whatever caught my eye. When I told him that he had to read all this stuff, though, it turned into just another pile of text, like a boring text book or something, that was looming over him before he could really get going. This made him procrastinate and eventually quit. 

Unfortunately when I realised this I was too late and he had lost his interest in language, but hey, please learn from my mistake: if someone asks you how to go about learning a language just give them the link to this site, tell them to poke around a bit(or just link them to this post, though they&#039;ll probably find it on their own), and make sure they don&#039;t turn it into some kind of dogma.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is this cool motivational guy, Christian Pankhurst, who makes the analogy that finding your path in life works like a GPS system in a car: you have to start driving in a direction first -- any direction -- for it to register whether you are going in the right or wrong direction. In other words, inactivity won&#039;t let you know if you&#039;re going in the right direction.
I thought this analogy worked great for this post =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s exactly what I do! I try to connect to the internet! I actually just bought my first Nintendo 3DS in Kyoto two days ago (wow? only 2 days... feels like we&#039;ve been through so much) and I didn&#039;t read the manual at all. I just opened it up, held it in my hands, raised it up on pride rock for a bit, listened to some animals sing, and then hit dat powah button. Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t connect it to the internet as I only have a lame ethernet connection in my room, but I did get to play some sweet ass virtual reality game. I felt like we really bonded after I destroyed the dragon with an extending neck coming out of my pillow and now we are the best of friends.

FWI, if you are trying to learn Japanese with a 3DS, the only vocab you will learn from Mario games is セーブしています。。。 so yeah. Get something like... actually, there is a game that produced by Level 5, in conjunction with Studio Ghibli called 二の国（にのくに）and it comes with a play through book that is necessary to finish the game. I&#039;ve heard good things about it from my friends and there is no, and never will be an English version for the NDS version. So yeah :) might be something worth buying.]]></description>
