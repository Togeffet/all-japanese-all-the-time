					<description><![CDATA[Hey, just a quick note, there is indeed a Kindle edition: http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Is-Overrated-ebook/dp/B001HD8NZ8/ I know because I read it when it first came out, and there&#039;s no way I paid the king&#039;s ransom it takes to get new English non-fiction in Shanghai, so it must have been on a Kindle. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I found a quote that made me think of you, in that I knew it would totally annoy you:

“Learning is not child&#039;s play; we cannot learn without pain” -Aristotle

See?  Even long dead people can be really wrong. :D

Anyway, that&#039;s not related at all to the above post, so...that seems like a cool book!  If only I was literate in Japanese and wasn&#039;t pretending to be illiterate in English.]]></description>
