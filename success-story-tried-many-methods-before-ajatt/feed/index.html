					<description><![CDATA[AJATT is definitely the way to go. I can identify with this way of thinking. It&#039;s hard to find a good method, and I&#039;m still not over the fact that I lost so much time looking for something good enough that could help me learn languages]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This brings back memories of my language exchange experiences. Chinese people usually message me on Skype, even though I try to explain to them that I am learning Japanese.

A Taiwanese person messaged me a couple days ago, and tried to explain (in broken English, over a bad microphone) a mathematical equation explaining the flow of electricity in computers. That was interesting, to say the least.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hate language exchanges. Yes, I tried them. And yes, I&#039;ve met nice people but I&#039;m only still in contact with the ones who don&#039;t use me as an &#039;English-pump&#039;. I answer some questions now and then, but most of the time our conversations end up being in the target language (in my case Spanish).

The people I have the best conversations with are the natives I met when I was in Spain. They only speak Spanish so that&#039;s only good for me I guess, hehe. I know it&#039;s a bit selfish but it&#039;s just brutal speaking half an hour English, half an hour Spanish (or any other language you study).]]></description>
