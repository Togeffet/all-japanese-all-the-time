					<description><![CDATA[Guys (or girls), have you actually read the OP ?
The word &quot;necessity&quot; is not even there.
And nor am I speaking anywhere about a necessity.

I&#039;m stating that first learning another language, in this case Latin and Old Greek, as a step-up for other languages is not dumb by definition, as suggested in the OP.

If you don&#039;t like learning those languages, please don&#039;t.
If you do like them, please do ... and hope for good teachers.
I did have really great teachers for both those languages. They were continuously crossreferencing the Latin and Old Greek words to other European languages and we learned a lot about the origin of our Western civilization in a very pleasant way.

By the way, one of the other things we learned during the reading of &quot;the classics&quot;, is to analyze the texts and try to find out what type of &quot;tricks&quot; the author was using to convey his or her message.
I find that one of the most usefull and important skills I ever learned in school.
It&#039;s the best antidote against deceptive one-liners, like the one on top of this article :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Read the original article : it is not speaking about a &quot;necessity&quot;, nor am I.
I state that it is NOT dumb to learn first Latin and Old Greek before tackling other European languages.
Yes, you first loose a lot of time, but afterwards you race through the other languages like a bullet train and moreover, you do it with insight, because you have a much clearer look on how those other languages are build up.
See the example I give with the Kanjis. It is not necessary to learn first the Kanjis when learning Japanese, in fact you first lose a lot of time, but afterwards, it pays back big time.

And besides the language part, you learn a lot about the origins of our western culture.
How is that for a nice bonus ...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree that a large part of the reason that it helps is that it results in you &lt;i&gt;knowing&lt;/i&gt; (not &quot;thinking&quot;, &lt;i&gt;knowing&lt;/i&gt; for certain) that you can learn another language, however...

You neglected to mention the second part of that: it also greatly assists you in learning another language because it teaches you &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to learn a language, that is by learning your first foreign language you learn &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to learn a foreign language, you learn all your own personal little quirks, you learn how &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; need to be taught in order to learn.  That&#039;s a big one right there.

Cheers,

					<description><![CDATA[For once, I don&#039;t agree.
I learned old Latin and Greek during my secondary school and it really helped me big time in learning other European languages.
Most of those languages (including English), I learned mostly by watching television and reading books.
My knowledge of those two old languages speeded up the learning experience tremendously, since a lot of the words and grammar in European languages are derived from those two.

To give a simple example :
Latin : fenestra
French : fen√™tre
Dutch : venster
Spanish : ventana
German : fenster
Though the English word is &quot;window&quot; (derived from Old-Norse), the English word &quot;defenestration&quot; (to throw someone out of the window), contains the Latin words &quot;de&quot; (out of, away from) and &quot;fenestra&quot;.

Another example :
Old Greek : thura
English : door
Dutch : deur
German : T√ºr
Latin : postis
French : porte
Spanish : puerta
Dutch : portaal
English : portal
...

I compare it somewhat to learning Kanjis. Once you know their basic meaning, it&#039;s much easier to learn actual words and you start to understand how Japanese words are formed with those Kanjis.
The same with Latin and Old Greek. Once I knew the basics, I started to see them popup in all European languages and a lot of times, I could derive the meaning of those foreign words, though I never learned them.
And since Japanese consists of about 11% loanwords, even there, knowledge of Latin and Old Greek can help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s just a plausible excuse to learn another language, or at least to take a look at it.  It seems that you can&#039;t just start learning another language because you want to and it&#039;s fun and also an easy thing to do with proper technique, no, fun is bad, first you have to justify it somehow --- so people make up all sorts of excuses; &#039;I need X for Y&#039; rather than &#039;I need X for fun&#039;.  On the other hand it&#039;s also an excuse _not_ to learn language Y for those who don&#039;t really want to learn Y.

My personal favorite so far is to try out a new technique.  For example, I&#039;ve been itching to try out MCDs for a long time but no projects seemed appropriate since it&#039;s easier for me to learn everything (with a few exceptions such as RTK) through media alone, so I finally took up Ancient Greek (where media is nonexistent --- unfortunately, people just weren&#039;t making any podcasts or movies 2500 years ago), which is too fun to learn by itself, and made some MCDs from http://www.amazon.co.jp/CD„Ç®„ÇØ„Çπ„Éó„É¨„Çπ-Âè§ÂÖ∏„ÇÆ„É™„Ç∑„Ç¢Ë™û-ËçíÊú®-Ëã±‰∏ñ/dp/4560005907/ for a start.  It&#039;s really nice to see how MCDs tremendously help to learn things in context where there&#039;s virtually no context :3]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it&#8217;s just a plausible excuse to learn another language, or at least to take a look at it.  It seems that you can&#8217;t just start learning another language because you want to and it&#8217;s fun and also an easy thing to do with proper technique, no, fun is bad, first you have to justify it somehow &#8212; so people make up all sorts of excuses; &#8216;I need X for Y&#8217; rather than &#8216;I need X for fun&#8217;.  On the other hand it&#8217;s also an excuse _not_ to learn language Y for those who don&#8217;t really want to learn Y.</p>
<p>My personal favorite so far is to try out a new technique.  For example, I&#8217;ve been itching to try out MCDs for a long time but no projects seemed appropriate since it&#8217;s easier for me to learn everything (with a few exceptions such as RTK) through media alone, so I finally took up Ancient Greek (where media is nonexistent &#8212; unfortunately, people just weren&#8217;t making any podcasts or movies 2500 years ago), which is too fun to learn by itself, and made some MCDs from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/CD„Ç®„ÇØ„Çπ„Éó„É¨„Çπ-Âè§ÂÖ∏„ÇÆ„É™„Ç∑„Ç¢Ë™û-ËçíÊú®-Ëã±‰∏ñ/dp/4560005907/" class="autohyperlink">www.amazon.co.jp/CD„Ç®„ÇØ„Çπ„Éó„É¨„Çπ-Âè§ÂÖ∏„ÇÆ„É™„Ç∑„Ç¢Ë™û-ËçíÊú®-Ëã±‰∏ñ/dp/4560005907/</a> for a start.  It&#8217;s really nice to see how MCDs tremendously help to learn things in context where there&#8217;s virtually no context :3</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d say that&#039;s actually true, I&#039;m learning a lot of things about the structure of English that I never would have otherwise learned from learning other languages.  However, there&#039;s a reason we don&#039;t know them and can still use the language perfectly; that knowledge&#039;s completely superfluous unless you&#039;re planning on majoring in linguistics :P]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of my German Teacher in school.

She was like &quot;You don&#039;t really know how a language works on the inside until you learn another one. Basically, you don&#039;t know how English works with all the patterns and such until you learn another language.&quot;

I felt so many WTFs at that moment.

I swear, my German teacher spews some of the most hilarious garbage sometimes, and I feel bad for the people in my class falling for the trap that they think they will get good in 4 years of public education language learning.]]></description>
