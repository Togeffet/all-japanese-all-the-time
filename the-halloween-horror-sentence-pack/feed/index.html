					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good sales tactic, is there a setting for PayPal so that with each purchase the price goes up a little? Or that the price increases over time? I was looking through my e-mail and happened to see this. The price of the pack is now $200.00]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Awwwww this post made me miss you. Also, I just saw this which means my withdrawal from the internet to get stuff done BACKFIRED. Stupid Timebomb. Takes me 10 days to see anything on the internet, apparently, but I&#039;ll buy it anyway. 

Instead of a compost pail. 

I want you to know that it&#039;s your fault that I won&#039;t have a compost pail. NONE. Fruit flies everywhere. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Darn it Khatzumoto, you finally got me. I saw this super early, saw that it had the 2 sentence packs I&#039;d been considering buying (my first and sci-fi), and saw that the price was great so I finally broke down and bought some of your stuff.
Now I&#039;m on Ajatt+ and I&#039;m more motivated and learning Japanese at a faster pace than ever.  Pretty trick of you, you sly fox you.]]></description>
