					<description><![CDATA[I am that supercharged person who has already hit fourth gear in Spanish, and am looking for a ride that will give me at least two more gears, and a bunch more of language horsepower...I am smart as a whip (I could give you numbers and GPA&#039;s and stuff and you&#039;d be impressed enough to know that I qualify for something intense and geared to the truly dedicated, but I&#039;d rather not number-drop).

Former Marine, studied aikido for several years. Have travelled in Latin America without a tour, a guide or even a phrasebook. Able to leap over tall translations in a single pass (with a little dictionary help when I hit a new word, which happens only infrequently).

I read Spanish newspapers regularly: ABC, El Pais, El Tiempo, La Nacion of CR, are some of the regulars. Watch TV. Watch movies. Of course, all in Spanish. Usually without subtitles. When I use subtitles I prefer Spanish ones.

My best friend from college days lives half the year in Baja. We communicate in writing and verbally several times a week, half of it in Spanish, even though both of us born in the EEUU. (He spent summers growing up in Cuba, before his grandfather lost his business due to &quot;modernization&quot; of Cuba.)

My accent, my vocab and my grammar are good enough that people often think I might have been born in a Spanish speaking country, and moved here when I was younger. Wrong, but thanks for the compliment. 

Don&#039;t think I mentioned that I too am a CS major, and also studied my *** off in a grad Acctg. program. I have a systematic and algebraically organized mind, which makes both the memorization and use of tenses fairly easy for me. I even  use the future perfect subjunctive once in a while, just to be a p***ant.

I am determined to move to a Spanish speaking country to live, while I am still young enough to enjoy it. I don&#039;t know what criteria you use for selection for the Neutrino program, but I believe it would be a good thing for me, and I believe I can make the cut, whatever criteria you use.

Will you give me a chance, please? ¿Me ayuda, por favor? Vd. no lo lamentaró sí Vd. lo hace. Hablo sin pelos y de mi corazón. Soy un estudiante ideal para su programa.]]></description>
