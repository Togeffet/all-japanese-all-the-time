					<description><![CDATA[Everyone always tells me to also say what I want to say in English because they don&#039;t understand my Japanese.
 
 
These are the same people that will lecture for an hour in English about　「それ」
 
I&#039;d rather sound like a child, because quite frankly, in Japanese I am a child. You&#039;ll never sound like a grown-up if you don&#039;t spit out words sooner or later. So if you have the audacity to correct my Japanese, at least correct it IN JAPANESE rather than feed an hour of English words ABOUT Japanese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify, I didn&#039;t intend for this to sound like I&#039;m anti-Lang-8, as you CAN get pointers on grammar and the correct vocabulary from using it.
The real issue is that you&#039;ll get the kind of language people think they speak and write. You&#039;re not &quot;supposed&quot; to end a question with だ or use 全然 before non-negative words, but you&#039;ll find some people doing these things in informal speech and writing. Sometimes it&#039;s okay.
Also, if you&#039;re looking to improve your writing to fit with grammar rules, I think a book on the subject or even a good Google search (http://bit.ly/o5hedt) can take you further than random native speakers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have to disagree here, in that on lang-8 the idea is that you are practicing composition, not speaking. If you start a sentence with &#039;but&#039; in English, you are writing incorrectly. If you handed in an essay at school with but at the beginning of a sentence, you would/should lose marks. It&#039;s important that we make this distinction clear. Writing and speaking are very different types of activity. With speaking we have an active audience, we can watch their expressions as we speak and see that they understand us. There is tone, context, body language, etc. With writing there is none of this, which is one reason why you need to take a different attitude and write clearly so that you cannot be misunderstood.]]></description>

I just stumbled upon something that said は emphasizes what comes after and が is before it. Since then i always though about it instead of just being natural and using what feels right. Luckily I don&#039;t do it that much anymore, but yeah. It&#039;s not good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Type 2 is exactly the reason I gave up on Lang-8 pretty quickly. When I was correcting people&#039;s English, it was always the English I thought I was speaking, but it still sounded kind of weird when I thought about it. I saw another English speaker say to never begin a sentence with &quot;but&quot;. But I realised I do that too!
You gotta learn to break the rules, but break the rules the right way. You can&#039;t and won&#039;t find a complete guide to that anywhere. It&#039;s something you can only get from experiencing the real thing, and using that to try to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; the real thing.
