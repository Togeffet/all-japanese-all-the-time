					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about this post a LOT in the past few days.

At the moment I&#039;m having Midwestern-Protestant-upbringing-level guilt about doing Japanese.  There&#039;s no reason why I *should* be doing it.  It isn&#039;t going to earn me any more money or help me transition into a career I actually enjoy (well, not any time soon anyway) or become the self-employed musician I was *supposed* to be...and yet I can&#039;t focus on those things because all I want to do is write to strangers on Twitter in a bastardised mix of English and awful Japanese.  It&#039;s almost getting to the point where it&#039;s like, maybe I should give up this crazy Japanese thing and go back to being &quot;normal&quot;...only I can&#039;t because it&#039;s so much fun.

At least I can draw some small comfort from the fact that, apparently, because I feel guilty and tormented about it, at least I&#039;m doing it &quot;right&quot;!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So...

You&#039;re saying that whatever source material you&#039;re using should be fun and interesting for you, it should meet what I think is the most important criteria: that if it were in your native language, you&#039;d still want to read/listen to/watch it?

You&#039;re saying it should be fun, in other words?

Shocker! ;)

Oh, and absolutely agreed.

Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I got into this phase where I was watching/reading/playing with things in Japanese that were all awesome, and I did this thing where I completed the games/animes/mangas that I was enjoying. But then I &#039;ran out&#039;, so to speak, of stuff and so I acquired a bunch more stuff from a friend. I started going through some anime series that were now on my hard drive, and attempting to complete them from start to finish. I did the whole &#039;try everything at least once&#039; thing, where even if the first episode of an anime wasn&#039;t so captivating, I would push on through the series to see if it got better. The result was that I stopped watching it. I stopped everything. It just happened. I didn&#039;t plan to stop, in fact, I planned to keep on going. But I subconsciously started prioritizing other things ahead of Japanese continuously, until before I knew it, a week had gone by and I hadn&#039;t watched a single episode of the anime I was trying to finish.
Â 
I now understand the importance of channel surfing. I&#039;m starting a new thing where I watch the first 3 episodes of an anime, and if I don&#039;t like it, I delete it. I might just cut it back to the first episode if this doesn&#039;t work. Or maybe just a quick flick through. I miss the days of watching Claymore during university exam&#039;s and being so captivated I wasn&#039;t able to study for my exams till I&#039;d finished the entire series. Now THAT&#039;s a guilty feeling haha.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is this philosophy supposed to apply to things outside of language learning?
For example there are plenty of books well-regarded books I have like Psycho Cybernetics that would give me plenty of society stars, and I wouldn&#039;t mind reading them as it interests me, but I still wouldn&#039;t feel guilty doing it either.
So while it wouldn&#039;t make me feel guilty to do it, it would also be pretty fun, however this article kind of gives that impression that I should feel guilty if I&#039;m not doing things that make me feel guilty.]]></description>
