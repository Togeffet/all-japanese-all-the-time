					<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of that one thing Khatz said ... hell, it might not have even been on this site. Something like... you don&#039;t know Japanese, you just get used to it as long as you keep doing it *constantly*. 

So much truth in that. It&#039;s pretty much like f**king magic once it happens, and you realize you&#039;re following all (okay, 99.9%) of the 漢字 in the 字幕 during an 映画 or ドラマ or even during some バラエティー show.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Spence, I think it depends on what extreme you take AJATT to as to whether or not the people around you care. Khatzumoto rightfully pushes 100%, but you can shave off 10-20% and skip all the &#039;alienating friends and family&#039; sacrifices. My dad invited me to see Avatar with him last week. I&#039;m not about to tell him &quot;Nope, it&#039;s in English.&quot; When my friends recommend a book, I pass, but when they want to hang out and play Rock Band, I&#039;m there.

My unwillingness to make social sacrifices almost made me avoid AJATT entirely, but it&#039;s turning out fine. I&#039;m making some fantastic progress. Yeah, I&#039;m not going to pull a &#039;Moto and be in Japan a year from now, but I&#039;m not in such a rush.

It comes down to the fact that AJATT is not completely binary. Yeah, you need the mega-monster-personality-changing-commitment, but you can go 90% and make a lot of progress. What you need to decide is whether or not 6 months matters. For me, I&#039;m 8 months into AJATT (5 kanji, 3 sentences, immersion for last 4), and I have a year and a half of college left. If I take even twice as long as Khatzumoto did to be reasonably proficient, none of my plans will change.

So to answer your question directly, no. No interventions, no &quot;You&#039;re taking this a little far.&quot; I annoy my friends when I reject English media recommendations, and I annoyed my family when I told them I don&#039;t want anything in English for Christmas, but that&#039;s all pretty tolerable, so nobody bats an eyelash.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, thinking in japanese will probably take alot of time. I&#039;m not quite at that level yet, but I am general understanding japanese easier than a few months ago. I can even  predict what ppl say now in most situations(not all of course). But i still think i&#039;m far from fluent yet. I remeber talking on the forum for reviewing the kanji. And i said i dreamt in japanese. And some replied back that, dreaming in the japanese means you&#039;re developing+gaining fluency. But when i look at my skills+success so far in  Japanese. It&#039;s still not where i want it to be. I used to add so much sentences before, but I have lower that now. Cuz they reviews were building up alot for the past few days. So as of today I&#039;m at 5100 sentences. Feels good to be this far into japanese and wanting to go far and very far into japanese. I&#039;m sure my motivation to get fluent+the love of japanese will get me fluent in no time.(1 year i;&#039;m hoping?!, ppl say that&#039;s the benchmark year for some majority improvements). But as long as people keep going, they will reach there goal. For some sooner than later.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Katz, are you aware that many people are using you as their &quot;person&quot; primitive down at Reviewing the Kanji?
It would seem that your blog is quite good at getting into people&#039;s heads...


&quot;On a side note, has anyone’s parents ever threatened to kick them out of the house if they don’t stop AJATTing?&quot;
No, but...  they made me go back to Spanish for a while.

If I listen to Spanish all day, I can think in it almost exclusively.  I&#039;m not quite that far in Japanese yet.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[short and sweet... just what I was looking for.  Some times taking the japanese route causes more stress than it is worth.  Like wearing head phones in the house, It is a huge deal in my house.  So, I switched to listening with speakers.  Little things like that make it less stressfull.  On a side note, has anyone&#039;s parents ever threaten to kick them out of the house if they don&#039;t stop AJATTing?  Well... this happened to me yesturday, not fun folks.  I think its time to lay low.  Use the foot in the door affect (start changing small and then slowly build up the immersion).

Best of luck to all.

					<description><![CDATA[What I try to do is to fill the gaps with up and down activities in Chinese. I have my power study methods: textbooks, SRS reps... basically active studying. But I also have my laissez-faire study methods. Basically, I found the gaps in my day where I wasn&#039;t doing something Chinese related and filled it in. My down activities involve watching a drama series I quite like, Chinese translations of The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy, manga, news, music videos, etc. Things I would do to blow time procrastinating in English, I just turned into Chinese. I made sure I had a variety of down activities that I would like to do. I don&#039;t always want to read a novel, so I&#039;ll switch to a comic book instead. Maybe I&#039;m lazy to read, or what I want to watch something while I eat, so I pop on the drama. Or, maybe I just want to sing poorly to drive away my friends, then I go for the music videos.

All in all, it&#039;s actually &lt;i&gt;really easy to do&lt;/i&gt; it&#039;s just hard to start. Wikipedia is a good place: look up what you like in English, then click on the &quot;other language&quot; sidebar and find the name of the movie/book/series/author in the language you want to pursue and then go find it :D That&#039;s what I did anyway.

Hope it helps! :)

And a P.S. you know how most of what we say in English is probably quoted from someplace else? Movies, books, TV shows, etc? Those &#039;catchphrases&#039; probably exist in other languages too, you just have to watch and read a lot and they&#039;ll start to pop up. Plus it&#039;s fun to pick a character to &quot;speak through&quot;. I found my voice through a combination of Keitaro Urashima and Arthur Dent. Chances are if you love then in English, you&#039;ll love them in your target language too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if this is the site to discuss this but has anyone had dreams in full japanese? It&#039;s weird as I&#039;ve only had two dreams in Japanese before. One was all full of kanji characters and the other full of japanese speech. Anyone care to share there own dreams-based on japanese in someway. Unno if this is anything related to learning japanese but I guess nothing wrong with it. I guess i&#039;m asking this because i&#039;m not yet capable of thinking in full japanese yet or fluent yet. But it&#039;s weird b/c I remebering just a week ago I was listening to japanese+watching anime for like 90% of the day. And I literally was dreaming in japnaese in every sense of the way lol. It was sooo weird. Anyhow anyone care to share?]]></description>
