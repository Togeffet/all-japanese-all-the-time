					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I didnt see it here, but you can try Format Factory. It&#039;s totally free, has a dvd ripper where you can change the audio/subtitle language settings, there is a video/audio merger, and you also can convert almost any video to audio as well.

The only drawback: it seems that it cannot handle filenames in non-roman scripts, but the interface is able to go into many different languages.

Peace&#124;Joy&#124;Love

					<description><![CDATA[Remember those mini-disc recorders?  They&#039;re old technology now, but they work wonders for language study.  You can rip any audio source (although it&#039;s &quot;ripped&quot; in real time), but the best thing is that you can track an audio file wherever you are.

I&#039;m often listening to a movie I&#039;ve ripped, and then i get to a sentence whose structure I&#039;m unfamiliar with.  So I just put a track mark at the end, and at the beginning--very easy to do on a subway, car, class, wherever--and loop it a few times.  Then, once I&#039;m bored with (i.e. have memorized) most of the movie, I can delete the longer passages that I know, and just keep the shorter passages whose structure I&#039;m still learning.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m on a Mac.  And like Khatz, my schedule doesn&#039;t like 90 min of straight audio study.  I found Fission http://www.rogueamoeba.com/fission/.  Has anyone had any experience with this.  It looks great but if I can get the job done for cheaper, I&#039;m up for suggestions.
Thanks,
Charles]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No problem Khatz.

I didn&#039;t rip everything which probably sped up the process a lot.  I&#039;ve got a program called &quot;avi-mpeg-wmv-rm to mp3 converter&quot; by Allok Soft that I use to get it into mp3 form in the first place which lets me watch a .avi and when I get to a part I want to rip I can say &quot;ok start here and go for....10 seconds.&quot;  A free program that you could use after ripping the sound (if you don&#039;t have that one but another way to do it and it only gives you the whole thing) is Audacity (for windows, but I think there&#039;s a mac version)  Then you look at the time on the .avi and match it up with the .mp3 time in audacity which lets you zoom in to rip a little chunk.  Then you cut out the section you want, paste it into another window.  From there, you can &quot;export as .mp3&quot; and you have it.  I guess if you wanted to make just one string of the characters stuff you could keep pasting into the same .mp3 window (I&#039;m not sure how to word it, but basically it would be like having 2 windows open, and continuing to paste into the new sound file window consecutively.)  I hope this makes sense because I changed direction in the middle of rewriting it and switched everything around.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks!  It looks like I&#039;ll have to convert some of my VBR files to constant bitrate files if I want to use that program to split them up.

Tony, I guess I was always nervous that 道明寺&#039;s speech irregularities weren&#039;t limited to the obvious ones where people call him out on it.  Certainly telling people that you&#039;ll ぶっ殺す them if they don&#039;t answer your phone call is rather uncommon, IMHO.  Gokusen also comes to mind as another great series 松本潤 is in, however that&#039;s also got pretty non-standard sounding speech.  (BTW, the Japanese subs for 花より男子 use dots next to the various words that 道明寺 messes up, as well as next to the corrected word.)

For those who have begun speaking, do you find that it&#039;s painfully slow in the beginning?  I think I can generally make good, grammatical sentences when speaking, but that usually involves long pauses between the various bits of the sentence.  I&#039;m generally formulating sentences directly in Japanese in my mind, but it takes a while to piece things together.  It&#039;s probably slow to the point where native speakers would not find it fun to listen to for more than a few minutes.  I can speak faster, but that generally involves tripping over words and saying things which are ungrammatical, hence my general decision to slow down.  Is going this slow a sign that I still shouldn&#039;t be trying to output things, or more just a sign that I need to do it more to work on my fluency?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The url for the mp3 splitter should be : http://www.codevisions.de/mp3splitter/readme.html
so I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s redirecting you to www.8op.com?

I thought about that when I was thinking about using 道明寺 as well, but since I&#039;m not using everything he says, and it&#039;s pretty clear when he makes a mistake since someone corrects him (in the English subbed version I&#039;ve got it also says what the mistake is and explains it), so I didn&#039;t think there was so much of a problem.  If you&#039;re looking to use him as an actor, I don&#039;t know how the subs are, but you could try 君はペット。]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The url for the mp3 splitter should be : <a href="http://www.codevisions.de/mp3splitter/readme.html" class="autohyperlink">www.codevisions.de/mp3splitter/readme.html</a><br />
so I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;s redirecting you to <a href="http://www.8op.com" class="autohyperlink">www.8op.com</a>?</p>
<p>I thought about that when I was thinking about using 道明寺 as well, but since I&#8217;m not using everything he says, and it&#8217;s pretty clear when he makes a mistake since someone corrects him (in the English subbed version I&#8217;ve got it also says what the mistake is and explains it), so I didn&#8217;t think there was so much of a problem.  If you&#8217;re looking to use him as an actor, I don&#8217;t know how the subs are, but you could try 君はペット。</p>

Actually, that never occurred to me, LOL! Maybe partly because back in the day, I didn&#039;t exactly own DVDs, if you catch my drift.. Anyway, chapters is a really good idea.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Does anyone have another download link for the MP3 Splitter referenced in the post?  The link on that page doesn&#039;t work for me -- www.8op.com can&#039;t be found.  (There doesn&#039;t seem to be a DNS entry for it.)

I also considered picking someone from 花より男子 to imitate.  I personally ruled out 道明寺 because his Japanese is purposefully odd in a lot of places.  Sadly, a lot of the stuff I have where there are characters I&#039;d like to imitate are animated.  So that doesn&#039;t work out well for looking at mouth shape, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another idea that I had before when you wrote the post about acting -- I took Hana Yori Dango and broke it down into sections where only Don Myouji was talking so I could listen to his parts over and over since that&#039;s who I wanted to imitate.  It works out well since the subtitles are exact and I don&#039;t have an overwhelming amount to go through at a time.  If you&#039;re breaking it up into these smaller sections and listening it&#039;ll be easier to remember/take out those things you want to copy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, this is unrelated to audio and Japanese, but it is related to Chinese, and it&#039;s just for you.  http://www.flash512.com/fullscreen.php?fname=20070800/0821/room.swf

I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s about since there are a ton of kanji, but on antimoon it said one of the things they did was play Monkey Island and this is some kind of game in Chinese (strongly making that assumption here, I don&#039;t know what the difference is between Cantonese and Mandarin or which one you&#039;re learning...or if they&#039;re written the same way but pronounced differently etc.) where you go looking for stuff.  My friend sent it to me and said &quot;Use your kanji skills!&quot;  But mine aren&#039;t for this one.]]></description>
