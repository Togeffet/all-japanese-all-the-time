					<description><![CDATA[with ditzy girls with names like “Kimberley”. . .gee thanks. *insulted*
Anyways. . .
I&#039;m sad, sad because I knew all along that I have to sacrifice tihngs I love beyond my own understanding to get to the place I&#039;m gonna get to. You just made it even more obvious, and real.
But acknowledgement is the first step. The rest comes afterwards.
(sudden urge to eat water chestnuts)
The people that are closest to me are on opposite ends of the scale on this.
On one hand, a person who knows equal exchange and therefore sacrifices a lot of time with family to be with friends and a lot of time with those friends to play videogames (true passion)
On the other a person who wants to do everything right and true and preferably all at once too.(imagine how much that person gets done in a day. . .not much)
So i know the joy of doing what you want to, and the sadness of the people you give up to do that.
You can&#039;t jump to one trapeze without letting go of the other but damn if most of us don&#039;t try to anyways.
Ah, all the things I&#039;m gonna miss. . .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m afraid I am NOT willing to do all that, not quite.
 
To me, the prospect of success afforded when I maintain my current life while also leading a &quot;Japanese life&quot; is good enough.
 
Maybe I won&#039;t learn Japanese to the level you did in 18 months, hell I may never get to your level, but I know Japanese can be learnt without such drastic measures and I&#039;m happy to pay the time penalty and the extra difficulty if it means maintaining a good protion of my current life.

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if you&#039;ll read this Tal, but it is pretty obvious that the reason he is so demanding is because he knows that we are all adults, and all have English in our lives somewhere. He even stated this. 

However, if he suddenly said, &#039;f it, just try and put the Japanese wherever it seems good, preferably after dinner and before late night with talk show host&#039; then the whole meaning would be lost.

You are telling me I have to not see my friends, not participate in society, not make NEW friends except for with people who speak Japanese...

Screw.

That.

Noise.

This reads like some sort of &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Language God&quot;.  Don&#039;t watch that movie on the weekend w/ your friends, YOU&#039;LL FAIL!
Don&#039;t chat with people in English... YOU&#039;LL FAIL!

That entire post was about as demotivational as possible.  Also, a ton of hogwash, as you yourself said that you had &quot;a life, a job&quot;, etc etc etc.]]></description>
