					<description><![CDATA[Hi khatzumoto! Thank you for your blog. It is inspiring, no doubts. 

A technical question regarding the SRS software. Can you address the source of flashcards with kanji&#039;s? I understand that there are resources of kanji&#039;s on the net, no matter commercial or for free. Am I right? 
I do not believe that in order to use SRS I have to enter each kanji into the software. Could you advice on that please? Can anyone help withthis access?

Thank you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Khatzumoto! 

Well before everything, a HUGE thank you is the least I can say, especially if you know that I tried billions of sites or/and techniques to learn japanese, and linguistic immersion happens to be the most simple, yet, the most effective. I don&#039;t really know if you have already been asked this question, nor if there is an answer for it somewhere in the site. But when it comes to learning kanji, which of those orders would be the best to follow:
Learning kanji by key, or strarting from the most simple to the most complicated, or starting from the most used words, or learning the kanji of every new word I learned? The last would probably be the best, but your confirmation is always welcome! 
P.S: I actually randomly learn them, which means: I learn the easiest from the new words I learn.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatzumoto,

Thanks a lot for this site, I&#039;ve discovered it a few days ago, and although I&#039;m studying Chinese (Mandarin), it&#039;s really helpful, with a few changes here and there because of the differences between Japanese/Chinese of course.

Although I know you&#039;ve said a few times that it doesn&#039;t matter which SRS you use, as long as you use one, I am still wondering if you could write how Khatzumemo compares to Anki (and Mnemosyne).

I was first using Mnemosyne, but now I also want to use SRS on other PCs and on my phone, so I was searching for an alternative, which brought me to Anki.
Which looks really cool and all with the nice interface and all extra options.. but many extra options always make me wonder if it&#039;s making up for something if you know what I mean. I like simple things. So maybe KhatzuMemo is the good middle way to go?

I saw in one of the articles that you&#039;ve started using Anki to study Cantonese because you can use audio files, have you totally switched to Anki? or are you using it next to KhatzuMemo?
Maybe some pros and cons between Anki/KhatzuMemo would be nice to read.

Thanks a alot for your time :)

Lorenzo.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Khatzumoto,</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for this site, I&#8217;ve discovered it a few days ago, and although I&#8217;m studying Chinese (Mandarin), it&#8217;s really helpful, with a few changes here and there because of the differences between Japanese/Chinese of course.</p>
<p>Although I know you&#8217;ve said a few times that it doesn&#8217;t matter which SRS you use, as long as you use one, I am still wondering if you could write how Khatzumemo compares to Anki (and Mnemosyne).</p>
<p>I was first using Mnemosyne, but now I also want to use SRS on other PCs and on my phone, so I was searching for an alternative, which brought me to Anki.<br />
Which looks really cool and all with the nice interface and all extra options.. but many extra options always make me wonder if it&#8217;s making up for something if you know what I mean. I like simple things. So maybe KhatzuMemo is the good middle way to go?</p>
<p>I saw in one of the articles that you&#8217;ve started using Anki to study Cantonese because you can use audio files, have you totally switched to Anki? or are you using it next to KhatzuMemo?<br />
Maybe some pros and cons between Anki/KhatzuMemo would be nice to read.</p>
<p>Thanks a alot for your time ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Lorenzo.</p>
