					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I get negative thoughts like that a lot. When I hear that someone knows more than me at the subject I&#039;m focusing on I end up hating the person and even more-so myself. I&#039;ve always known its a bad attitude to have but its a basic feeling that&#039;s popped up numerous times during my Japanese studying. &quot;Oh look that guy can read novels easy and I&#039;m having to look up words in my manga with furigana, guess I should just give up I&#039;ll never be like that guy&quot;. I&#039;ve had those thoughts a lot and its always had a negative effect on my progress...and its just not fun. I had been just ignoring other learners (no matter what level) to try to get rid of this problem but I guess the whole parent idea does have its merits.]]></description>
