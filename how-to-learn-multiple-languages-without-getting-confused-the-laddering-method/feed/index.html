					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been learning Japanese for about 5 months, but I&#039;m not good enough to read a textbook in the language. However, I&#039;m going to a new school in the fall (a Boarding School in CT) and their sister school is in Beijing, meaning half the population at my school is Chinese. All of these students speak Chinese and my mother warned me: &quot;If you go to this school, you need to know enough Chinese to hold a conversation.&quot; I didn&#039;t believe her until I had my interview, where the only non-Chinese appliers that day were me and 2 other kids. 

So now I&#039;m trying to pick up Chinese, but I can&#039;t find a single Japanese textbook *written in Chinese* qq. Where do you actually find these things?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz!! I have a question regarding this as a person starting their 3rd language.

I&#039;m a native English speaker, and in 2 years I became fluent in Japanese (whether speaking/reading/writing/listening).
I&#039;ve started Spanish using English again as my base language.

Now I&#039;d love to use Japanese as my base language, however it seems (from what I hear, and from the early stages) that Spanish and English are quite clearly WAY closer together than Japanese and Spanish.  Grammatically and in terms of vocab.

I can see why one would go from Japanese-Chinese, but would you still &#039;ladder&#039; the languages so different like Spanish-Japanese?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Although the Chinese economy is growing really fast, I am still rather skeptical weather millions and millions of foreigners will be able to speak mandarin by 2050. In the past, people from developing countries often might have thought that learning the English language meant that you would (in the most cases) have connections to a country which had an economical advantage over yours. So by learning English you might be able to move from a job that earns you like a few hundred dollars a month to a job that earns a few thousand. This must have been a huge motivator and one of the more common reasons why people wanted to learn English so desperately. I think for foreigners learning mandarin today, it is rather the connections that you will make and the opportunities you get out of that which might help you economically during your career. Entering the Chinese workforce will not give you any direct economic advantage. Obviously if you can live as an expat in China earning the same amount of money as you do in most western countries, then yes…you will definitely be benefiting on that. 

The difference is Opportunity (indirect benefit that has to be recognized first) VS. Money (direct benefit that is easy to recognize) 

Opportunities have to be recognized before there is any motivation to create action. I still find that a lot of people are still ignorant or unaware to what benefits there are when learning a new language. (However it’s great to see so many people learning Japanese on this website) 

For those who learn or learned English in the past, it&#039;s pretty clear what the motivation was. Everyone knew the benefits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think this is a really interesting idea and I agree that are many benefits to it. And for my case, I&#039;m also learning Chinese using English. 
And using this method would also mean that one would proceed with a new language only when one has mastered the current language. And learning another new language using the newly-mastered language as a base language provides an excellent opportunity to review and improve that base language as well.
Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I never looked at this issue from this point of view, though I guess I&#039;ve been doing it kind of unconciously... I am Brazilian, so I&#039;m a native Portuguese speaker. English came very smoothly to me, cause even though I&#039;ve never studied it in an English school, I&#039;ve learned it quite effortlessly. So, a couple of years ago I &quot;discovered&quot; Japan and I completly and blindly fell in love with it. Learning the language became an obligation to me. I decided to dedicate some time to study it daily, but I couldn&#039;t (and still can&#039;t) reach the level of fluency I long for... this year I&#039;ve started a French course, and as a &quot;base language&quot; I&#039;m using what I know from the Japanese and it&#039;s amazing how fast I&#039;m improving both, my Japanese and French. Thanks for sharing this awesome tip with us! ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Merci beaucoup pour cette méthode.

I&#039;ve been speaking French for about half a year now, and have kicked up my approaching fluency by immersing myself after reading of your ideas for doing that. I&#039;m also very glad that I bought a monolingual dictionary relatively soon.  It keeps me from having to context switch back into English every time I need to look up a word (I can&#039;t give you credit for that idea though, unfortunately).

Now, I was thinking for some time about which language to learn next.  I thought that I would want to learn Spanish next, but the more that I thought about it the less it held my immediate interest.  I had wanted to learn Chinese for a long time, but all of the information about how hard it was turned me off to it.  The characters scared me, and the tones didn&#039;t help that.

I read a wealth of information on your site, and I realized how possible it was for me to learn Chinese.  I finally decided to go for it and get some studying materials for Chinese in French.  I&#039;m pretty excited about it, although I know to succeed I will need to have a similar approach as my French that got me where I am, able to handle conversations as long as they aren&#039;t too fast.  I&#039;m in the process of looking for podcasts and other material to start listening right away, while the books travel to me from France.]]></description>

I had wanted to learn Chinese for a long time, but all of the information about how hard it was turned me off to it.  The characters scared me, and the tones didn&#8217;t help that.</p>
<p>I read a wealth of information on your site, and I realized how possible it was for me to learn Chinese.  I finally decided to go for it and get some studying materials for Chinese in French.  I&#8217;m pretty excited about it, although I know to succeed I will need to have a similar approach as my French that got me where I am, able to handle conversations as long as they aren&#8217;t too fast.  I&#8217;m in the process of looking for podcasts and other material to start listening right away, while the books travel to me from France.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello ! 
Really GREAT website.
I discover it this morning and will be back very often.
I totally agree with this article. I am french and I started learning japanese
last month.
Material in french to study Japanese is pretty poor, so I decided to use english
material to do it. It works fine for me. 
English and Japanese do not mix in my head.
I was using the &quot;laddering method&quot; without kwowing it :-)
Bonne journée à tous !  Jaa mata !]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great site! The most helpful thing I&#039;ve found on language learning so far!

The article about laddering is very true. I am a Peace Corps volunteer living in an African francophone (French speaking) country. I am learning the African language in French, and I notice both languages go much faster when it&#039;s done this way verses learning the African language in English (my native tongue). I think it&#039;s very important that the two languages you are learning are at different levels; one needs to be at least a comfortable intermediate level. A bonus of laddering is that if your base language isn&#039;t very strong, you&#039;ll not only NOT forget any of it (which is a problem when learning multiple languages), but laddering provides a great support for the base lang. 

My best advice for language learning is exactly the main point of this website: immersion. When you have no choice or outlet, the language will come. Language learning can be very intimidating (especially for Americans) but it really is all in our heads. To learn multiple languages fluently is not a miracle or just something you read about online. The proof is in the hundreds of thousands of Peace Corps volunteers who can converse in a foreign language in two months and are fluent within two years. 

My question:
Anyone who&#039;s learned multiple languages at once, do you feel that your progress was slower because of it? I&#039;m wondering if spending equal time on two languages means both will move at a slower pace than if i put all my efforts into one language (which seems like common sense, but seeing everyones comments about laddering, it seems like learning two using the laddering system wouldn&#039;t slow things down all that much?). Sure, laddering works much better than learning two languages NOT laddering, but does it slow down progress compared to learning just one?]]></description>
