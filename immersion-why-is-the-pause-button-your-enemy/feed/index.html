					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really loop, but I have Japanese TV (I dont live in Japan). This goes on 24/7, so, its pretty good for immersion. Sometimes there is not much interesting to see, then I just lower the volume like you suggest.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I got it, loop that sh#t until you find new immersion media that suits you haha. But I personally think that people are way to picky with media, I mean if you&#039;re looking for good new movies, series animes etc. it&#039;s not like you&#039;ll have to watch the whole movie or series, if you don&#039;t like the first episode or trailer of a movie don&#039;t watch it and look for something that will be fun for you.There are so many sucky animes out there, and you don&#039;t have to be a masochichst and watch through one where you&#039;ll just be bored to hell. I think that people are kind of scared to try out new things, we want to stay in our usual life routine, the one we&#039;ve been used to so long. I guess that&#039;s why many people  are never able to learn new languages or many underrated works never get discovered and successful and Madden,Fifa make millions every release even though it&#039;s the same recycled crap every year lol.]]></description>
