					<description><![CDATA[This really shows how low people can be sometimes. I mean the whole ajatt thing, originally, is not about personal profit, its about how Khatz decided to share with the others a set of methods and tools he gathered and worked with to achieve a goal. He could have kept it for himself, but doing so is not doing justice to Japanese, with all the misconceptions and myths about this &quot;impossible&quot; language. The method is not even for profit, one can achieve fluency without even buying any of the premium/plus materials that are there for conveninence. The blog is for the purpose of sharing, discussing and (self)improving, and it is great for this purpose. Thanks to Tkyosam&#039;s video, I discovered this unique blog. And thanks to rules of nature its uniqueness is not endangered by plagiarism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a damn shame the guy was ripping off AJATT. If it was presented as an archive of sorts, and kept donation and amazon links going to you, I probably would&#039;ve changed my homepage to that just for that layout.

Honestly, I&#039;m not really feeling the green and orange. Any chance of a new layout? Possibly one selectable by users (with color info stored using cookies or something)?

This is the color layout I use on another site, and I find it extremely easy on the eyes.

					<description><![CDATA[Have been reading the updates for a while and I&#039;m sold! Have spent the last few weeks on Heisig&#039;s method, pushed past 1,000 more easily than imagined, and am excited to get &#039;em all done soon. Residing in Japan is also quite helpful, as I&#039;m able to glance at signs and have a sometimes good, sometimes vague, idea of what I&#039;m seeing. And even without the ability to &quot;read the sounds&quot; of the kanji, let me say how immensely helpful it was to simply understand that where I might have wanted to park the other night was &quot;special use parking&quot; and subject to nastiness. :o So to Khatzumoto, and all the others giving their good input, thanks!

ASIDE:
Stepping away from the praise and goodness for a while, I was amazed to read that someone would be silly enough to even attempt a &quot;reformation&quot; of this site. I mean the AJATT idea itself is so novel.... Anyway, some independent research of my own revealed that this &quot;Maki&quot; character seems to be a no more than a bored 17 year-old punk. I won&#039;t tell you exactly how I went about it, because I don&#039;t like the idea of coming off as a vigilante, but it&#039;s the internet...it&#039;s not hard to find things.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Khatz! I was really curious about that site.After all, if it weren&#039;t for the exact copy of your articles I think it would be a great site helping diffuse(?) the method. The author did create some original content but unfortunately for him the major part had been created by you. Once again, thanks for the screenshots. You could even take some ideas from there, what do you think? :D]]></description>
