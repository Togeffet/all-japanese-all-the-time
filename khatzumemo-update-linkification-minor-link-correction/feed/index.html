@„É§„Éã
a great idea!
the possiblity to EXPORT your items from Khatzumemo would be very helpful, especially if you want to work offline (with another program then)...

have fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this great learning tool.

I would like to be able to export my items. Then I could have my own backup copy of my collected sentences, and if this page just vanishes one day I would still have my efforts in my storage. Sometimes this page works quite slowly and there are even times I don&#039;t have Internet connection. Therefore I would like to be able to import my items to Mnemosyne.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz....

Just thought I would let you know: last night I was doing anything and everything but Korean, and when I went to check this site and saw your twitter entry &quot;&quot;((((DO SOMETHING!) SMALL) USEFUL) NOW!)&quot;  ......that was enough inspiration for me to immediately get off my a** (figuratively, I stayed sitting) and get about 3 hours of sentence picking in. So thanks, it really is the little things that make the difference :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Satoshi, if you use firefox you could try using the text-to-image addon and just putting the URL of the pictures in instead of using IMG tags. I think it should do what you want.

					<description><![CDATA[Also, another long-shot, but once again, lemme try:

Is it possible to add some option for making both sides of the &quot;cards&quot; be questions?

Like having the question „ÄåÊó©„Äç and the answer &quot;Early&quot; and also the question &quot;Early&quot; and the answer „ÄåÊó©„Äç without having to add two separate entries?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know this is probably a long-shot, but lemme try:

Would it be possible to turn image links inside [img][/img] into actual images in the page? 
I use it for adding stroke order diagrams into my reps.

A script did the job of fetching me the images, but the script is now gone and does no longer work.


Hmmm... pretty please?]]></description>
