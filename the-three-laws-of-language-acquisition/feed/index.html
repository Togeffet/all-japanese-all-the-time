					<description><![CDATA[This past week, I tried a new spin on my kanji SRS reps.  I&#039;d been doing the same 2000 kanji (Heisig vol 1) for a month and it was starting to get boring (anti-#1).  I noticed that I either knew it right away, or I thought that I &quot;should&quot; know it and racked my brain for a whole minute before giving up.

So I decided that was stupid (anti-#1): if I didn&#039;t know, I shouldn&#039;t waste 60 seconds on it.  I shouldn&#039;t waste 10 seconds on it!  It&#039;ll be back.  So, new rule: you have 2 seconds to answer (#3).  Even for kanji I knew pretty well, this switched me from &quot;walk through the story&quot;-mode into &quot;quick, what&#039;s the first thing you think when you see this?&quot;-mode.

The time needed for SRS reps, of course, went way down.  Surprisingly, the percentage-correct didn&#039;t go down at all (#2).  It turns out that, most of the time, even for kanji where I was consciously using the story, it had somehow unconsciously made an association straight from shape to idea.

And since I can get through more kanji in less time, I&#039;m seeing all of them a lot more frequently now (#3).  I don&#039;t know that this can work for sentences, or for learning new kanji, but it makes review of old kanji much easier for me.]]></description>
