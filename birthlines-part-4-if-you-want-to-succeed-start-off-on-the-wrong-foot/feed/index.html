					<description><![CDATA[all sorts of tricks are needed for ppl in our generation... &#039;Generation No Discipline&#039;
I&#039;ve used all these techniques before, but i eventually just realized i am an inherently lazy spoiled x-computer boy and ppl in the real world with real jobs (like my wife) work 4hours +30min break +4 hours  and don&#039;t complain about it- even after 10 years of doing the same thing.  
Work ethic isn&#039;t a word you hear being thrown around anymore....Awhile back i was doing some reading on Norman Rockwell.... that dude was a discipline machine.

Anyway, now i just try to buck up and face the music, taking the &#039;gawd i deserve facebook time, but i&#039;m working&#039; along with the &#039;wow, work is so inspiring right now, i&#039;m glad i&#039;m working&#039;.  At the end of the day i feel really good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Maya
I think one of the points of timeboxing is just as a means to get yourself started on the task and working on the task with some consistency.  So, if, after 30 mins, you are into the task and want to keep going, by all means go for it.  I&#039;ve read a good portion of this blog, and I think Khatz would probably say, if you are still having fun after 30 mins, continue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@maya timeboxing really only works for really small chunks of time and *really* crazy people (including khatz ;) ) if you&#039;re doing 30 minute chunks, you may want to try out time-slotting (I just made that term up, but it&#039;s what I do), which is designate certain portions of your day to doing the task you wish to do (be it taking a bath, eating lunch, reading a manga, or just doing SRS for 30-60 minutes). 

Yeah, it looks like a schedule, I know. But the schedule can vary from day to day. You can stick that 30 minute time-slot of SRS in the morning, afternoon, or evening, or even on Tuesdays and Fridays, and *then* go crazy with it and make an excel sheet of timeslots for your entire week... like I did.

So... whatever crazy way fits you better, as long as you&#039;re doing something, it works :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know... Little and often is all well and good, but I think that you&#039;re going to have to &#039;hunker down and get serious&#039; every now and then. it&#039;s like how you cant just sleep for 1 minute then be awake for 20 then sleep for 1 minute and so on. It&#039;s better to get a solid 8 hours than to space it out.  Or like how in another article Khatz talks about boiling water. Well you know what boils water? Constant heat! Not having the heat on for one minute, turning it off for 20 then turning it on for 1. So what i&#039;m saying is hunker down&#039; i.e. turn on your flame till the water boils then you can turn the flame down(i.e.timebox) to keep the water hot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, khatz, I have a question related to timeboxing (it kinda relates to something you mentioned in this post):

When you sit down to do something and you timebox (eg. &quot;I&#039;m only giving myself 30 mins to do this&quot;), how do you enforce that time limit? Assuming you have a bit of extra time after those 30 mins (eg. you&#039;re not obliged to leave the house right after), isn&#039;t it almost too easy to tell yourself that you can just continue for another 10-20 mins? I find myself doing this a lot, and I feel like it&#039;s defeating the point of timeboxing in the first place.]]></description>
