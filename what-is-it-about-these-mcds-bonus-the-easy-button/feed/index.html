					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to know if there is a way to set a note for each clozed word, e.g.

&quot;My cat has teared my new shirt.&quot;

Cloze 1: &quot;cat&quot; 
Note 1: (dictionary definition) a small domesticated feline mammal

Cloze 2: &quot;teared&quot; 
Note 2: to cause (material, paper, etc) to come apart or (of material, etc) to come apart.

So, when I&#039;m reading cloze 1 the card should show:

-------
&quot;My #### has teared my new shirt.&quot; 
*a small domesticated feline mammal
-------

and cloze 2:

-------
&quot;My cat has #### my new shirt.&quot; 
*to cause (material, paper, etc) to come apart or (of material, etc) to come apart.
-------

Can I do this? D:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you do this:

Deck Preparation

1. Open your Sentences or MCD deck.

2. Click Settings -&#062; Deck Properties …

3. Click the “Add” button

4. Select “Add: Japanese MCD” and click OK

5. Close the Deck Properties window

How do you do number 1?  Everything I try does not allow for me to go to number 2.  I cannot find any option in Anki, with mcdsupport installed, that matches number 2, and I have no idea what number 1 refers to.

I know.  I&#039;m totally clueless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[allow me to change my opinion on this.
 
i figured out how to set-up the phrases i want clozed... this is the real deal.
 
this is SRS evolved. this is the next step. you literally just continue reading or listening to what you want, as you input it. it is so much more exciting and satisfying than plowing through an SRS deck filled with 20 kanji in a single sentence.
 
congrats on this excellent new system, AJATT members!]]></description>

Furthermore the plugin will have Mecab support, thanks to a generous GitHub contributor, which will allow you to create insane amounts of MCDs from a single cut and paste.

					<description><![CDATA[Appreciate the add-on and the articles. I&#039;ve since incorporated MCDs as a way to contextualize the individual kanji&#039;s of compounds, while relying on sentences to contextualize the meaning of the compounds themselves. It has been too early to tell whether or not this is effective, but I certainly feel like it&#039;s going somewhere
Thanks again dude, this site has been the primary catalyst for the path that I started down 6 months ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi guys.

Has anyone heard/used Michel Thomas method? I&#039;ve only started learning Japanese and I went for Michel&#039;s course because I had used it before (to learn Spanish) and I must say it worked perfectly for me. After a month or so (to be honest I didn&#039;t study that hard), i was able to hold a simple conversation with a native Spanish person. At the same time I discovered Anki and I&#039;m using &quot;Heidig&#039;s Remembering the Kanji&quot; deck. 

Just wonder if there&#039;s anyone out there who used Michel&#039;s method to learn Japanese...

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;m sure this will help a lot!
 
After using my batch file for a while, I&#039;ve found it&#039;s intrusive enough to annoy me, but I have yet to do any reps when it pops up. &quot;Next time&quot; I tell myself. 
It does work though, so I&#039;ll just have to be more disciplined. I&#039;m not going to whip myself, but telling myself to do my reps before continuing what I was doing will be good enough (I only do thirty cards per session, so it&#039;s not like it&#039;s a lot).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wont try to guess what フレヂィー is doing, but take a look at http://ankisrs.net/docs/FileImport.html.  Anki can import files in a simple format into decks, the question and answer just need to be separated by a tab, semicolon, or other special character.  If it helps you can open a deck, choose &quot;export&quot; from the &quot;file&quot; menu and then choose &quot;cards in tab-separated file&quot; as the format.  This will give you a file in the same format you&#039;d use to import cards. If you&#039;re uploading whole sentences you can then use the &quot;Regenerate Readings&quot; action (http://ankisrs.net/docs/JapaneseSupport.html) to generate the furigana, assuming you&#039;re using the Japanese plugin.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s actually a very useful plugin uploaded to Anki that can add vocab cards from text files, called &quot;Yomichan.&quot; It&#039;s nice due to the fact that you can add multiple different words from a single fragment of text (like the first segment of four-character compounds) and that you can pick up where you left off when reading a text file. I use it for adding vocab from visual novel logs I keep around, or from digitized books. You can even import the sentence the word was in, for extra context.
 
Hope this helps!

					<description><![CDATA[Hm, that&#039;s actually similar to what I was going to try. But unfortunately, it&#039;ll have to wait, because my computer has broken down yet again, so I&#039;ll just have to stick to reviewing stuff on my iPod.
But I do second the question: do you think you could share the script? I&#039;m sure it&#039;d be a lot of help to other lazy Anki users - or at least ones that don&#039;t have enough knowledge to create such a script themselves xD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Care to share your script? Or is it Top Secret?
 
To me, every little thing helps (as I&#039;m quite lazy and tend to procrastinate a lot). I even made a slightly simpler (if you&#039;re a windows user) batch file to open Anki for me every hour. (It&#039;s only simpler because it doesn&#039;t require any outside programs except a tool from Microsoft (free) to give a SLEEP command)
I might rewrite it in Python (&#039;cause I know more of Python and it will work better for anyone).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[One thing I recommend is to do what I&#039;ve been doing lately. Though this mainly works if you work on a computer all day like me.

I keep a text file and just keep adding things, at end of day I wrote a script that adds the files to Anki automatically. But you can easily just import them manually end of day, or week, what have you.

example of text file.

地図 (ちず);map
地獄 (じごく);hell
成功 (せいこう);success
成長 (せいちゅう);growth
市販 (しはん);commercially available
製品 (せいひん);goods

etc.

This helps a little with the issue of adding stuff to anki one at a time, you can do sentences, too. 

頑張って！ ]]></description>
