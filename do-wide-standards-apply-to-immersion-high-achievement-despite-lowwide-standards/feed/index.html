					<description><![CDATA[I never read this post before (well, in it&#039;s entirety). Weird, I know (I am on day 73 of SS Vanilla). I got to say, it made me feel A LOT better about my level of immersion. I live in Japan, so a plus there, but I am in the Navy, and work in a 100% English speaking environment. My friends/coworkers even get mad at me at work too when I change the TV to a Japanese channel, and not stupid AFN (Armed Forces Network or something, basically USA channels wherever there is a base). But, when I am at home, or in my car, (basically AWAY from the base) nearly everything else I do is in Japanese. Unless I am at the Chu-Hi stand, and that&#039;s only on Fridays! ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To combat the japanese OS problem, i get the 90 day enterprise trial from MS in japanese, and every 90 days just back up and reformated 超ちょろいだぜ、ちょろい！
If you have a ps3, you can change the interface, and sell your old games for japanese ones (or jap versions)　Also, any system up to GC can be emulated, it&#039;s how I play my old games like FFV and Ocarina of time in japanese!
For books and movies, first off try with your favorite genres when you were in english, and if not, just experiment. Not endorsing torrenting. &lt;em&gt;Ok, maybe I am,仕方ないｗｗ&lt;/em&gt; but it&#039;s the only way I can get my old anime that will cost me 八千以上ドル if I tried buying it.
 
tkyosam made a video about blocking the subs, just put a piece of paper across the length of the monitor at the bottom.

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;strong&gt;they’d get better results with a deliberate focus on maximizing the immersion function at all times and in all places&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;
Just realized that, even here, a wide-standard applies.  For people struggling against an environment that wont allow them to immerse anything like a genuine 100%, applying the principle quoted above has to become a game if it isnt to become some kind of self-torture device instead.  This means giving yourself credit for all the little wins all day long. So you are applying a wide standard every time you give yourself credit for figuring out a way to cram a little more japanese in your day.

For those of us in the situation Khatz described as &quot;time-rich,&quot; though, the only thing we struggle against are our own psychological limitations, and so its difficult to see it in the same, game-like perspective, and why I earlier failed to see how to apply wide-standards to immersion, though it is very clear now. For those of us in this position, leveraged immersion provides a new game within which to attempt to achieve the principle behind AJATT : &quot;All Japanese All the Time.&quot;  Instead of playing the &quot;where can I sneak in five more minutes of Japanese game?&quot; we can now play the, &quot;Where can I remove English so it&#039;s less convenient to use it&quot; game. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to refuse to allow myself to touch any object until I could tell you what it was called in Spanish.  If I went to make a sandwich I would say to myself aloud, in Spanish, &quot;Opening the refrigerator...&quot; and if I could think of the word for refrigerator or spatula or pan or butter or what-have-you, then I&#039;d have to grab the dictionary and look it up first :D

					<description><![CDATA[The interesting thing is that this isn&#039;t really a compromise. It&#039;s just a different way of framing the experience. Basically you just back up a step and say, &quot;If the goal is All Japanese All the Time, what points in my environment can I leverage to get me closest to that goal&quot; and doing that instead of trying to overcome human psychology. This way has the same ultimate goal: As much japanese as possible, and the same results: Exposure to a lot of Japanese, It just accepts the fact that English probably will creep in , in places and at times, and provides a way to accept that without having to feel guilty, because you can know you have created a system/environment that will take care of things.  Doing all your management up front, and then letting go and not micro-managing yourself to death. And thats a good thing, because all that energy we normally waste on feeling guilty, now we can apply to doing some SRS reps or something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definitely makes me feel better. With all the other stuff I&#039;ve been having to do lately, it&#039;s only about an hour or two a day that I can actually do Japanese, mostly Anki reviews and trying to rebuild my RTK knowledge. Since wide standards apply to immersion too, I don&#039;t have to worry about &quot;oh, I *have* to listen to anime in the background when I&#039;m playing Gmod or working on that Minecraft mod&quot; (the former doesn&#039;t work because I found out I can only get a playable framerate in fullscreen, which breaks alt-tab and mutes background windows, and last time I tried the latter, my Java compiler exploded because I typed &quot;雪ボールを落とす&quot; instead of &quot;drop(Item.snowball)&quot;), I can just focus on &quot;during that time that I can 日本語をする, it should be 100%&quot;.]]></description>
