					<description><![CDATA[This entire posts pretty much sums up my entire experience with Japanese classes. A lot of people would complain about how &quot;hard&quot; kanji is and wouldn&#039;t study at all outside of class. I was one of them until I found &quot;the way.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more. I have a wife, a child, a full-time job and through all of this I&#039;ve managed to get through RTK1, SRS EVERYDAY, learn something new everyday (give or take a day when I am sick or etc), but through all that I still seem to love to learn the language and not be bored and it&#039;s all because of sites like this one that teach self-learners the tools to make their own environment, one that works for each individual.

Have I ever picked up a text-book? No. One of my hobbies is fish aquariums so I bought a fish aquarium book in Japanese, downloaded manuals for my equipment in Japanese, etc. Stuff like that keeps a person entertained.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked how you put many of the key points in bold, I don&#039;t know if that was Khatz modifying the passage a bit, or if Shawn did that from the start, but I think that the sentence &quot;When your system is about to break you, break the system&quot; should also be in highlighted.  I like that quote.]]></description>
