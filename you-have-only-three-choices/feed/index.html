					<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to share a little win with everyone. I&#039;m reading a murder mystery novel （ガリレオの苦悩） and listening to a molecular physics lecture from Kyoto University on Youtube. I was putting in sentences from my book to my SRS, and I had just learned a new word, and a minute later I heard the word in the video. I&#039;m like &quot;No way! I JUST learned that word! This is awesome!&quot; For those who are curious, it&#039;s 合理的。 Getting closer to fluency every day~]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto, man! Japanese is my third language and when my brother and I were very young, we decided to learn English but we could not afford to pay. Many of the ideas we came up together (which I&#039;ve been using for Japanese) resembles a lot what you explain in your site. It makes me pretty happy to see there are minds alike in this world although I think yours is way more hardcore than mine. Anyway, thank you for the suggestions of resources, the inspiration and all the other bulls##t you post here. Pretty legit. I&#039;m taking some from you and following my way to master Japanese.
Wish you the best.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s the mediocre choice that leads to excellence&quot; 
Eh, this is a nice quote. Consistent mediocrity is far better than infrequent bursts of excellence.
It&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s sustainable. Mediocre is one&#039;s default mode, excellence is an abnormality.

This is why &#039;lazy&#039; people tend to be more productive than &#039;hard workers&#039; - the most &#039;hard working&#039; people may strain themselves for a few hours, but then they spend the rest of the day unconscious. Hard work breeds slackers.]]></description>
