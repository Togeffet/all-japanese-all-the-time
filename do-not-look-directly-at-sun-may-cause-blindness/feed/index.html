					<description><![CDATA[Because your mind is doing overtime 24/7 and never shuts off. It&#039;s constantly making reference points to link back to, no matter how small or insignificant those points are. It&#039;s how you learned language as a child, without SRS, without even having a base language to build off of, without a Baby to English Oxford dictionary etc.


It&#039;s part of the reason this process works. Because people believe you have to be a child to do immersion and are to scared to attempt this no one knows that it works. However, obviously you need to be in the &quot;trenches&quot; for it work. It isn&#039;t even requirement to speak Japanese in Japan or Chinese in China, you could get around fine and come back not speaking a lick better. It&#039;s all about exposure, and forced exposure at that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, another piece of art by Khatzumoto - but I must say, this article surprised me most out of every other I&#039;d ever read. 

His links, that philosophy, our comprehension and the all together brilliance. 
Well done Khatz, you&#039;ve outdone yourself this time. ^^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz,
I&#039;m a new reader and first time commenter hoping for opinions either from you or anyone else.  

Long story short, I live with a Hong Kong family in New York and after reading your site a lot more in depth I&#039;ve spent the past month and a half ACATT (All Cantonese ATT).  My learning is speeding up and my previous two years of learning by trial and error is now getting replaced by Anki deck character study, watching movies without English subtitles and listening to way more Cantonese on Youtube whether I understand it or not (about two or three hours every day like this).  It was a great feeling when after two or three days my brain just accepted the input and didn&#039;t fight back!!! It was almost tangible pain at first focusing and listening for over 40 minutes, but now it&#039;s just regular background noise.

Here&#039;s the reason for my post, I&#039;ve noticed in the middle of a movie my mind will just come up with a thought (冇問題, 飛快 or short phrases like this) and then a SPLIT SECOND LATER the characters in the movie will speak them.  Is it just me?!! It freaks me out and I know I&#039;m not psychic but it&#039;s happened about three or four times in the past few days.  How is my mind predicting what the characters will say in a language I&#039;m not even close to understanding, in a movie I haven&#039;t seen before?

My only reasoning is that there is a conscious level of thought running parallel to a much-faster subconscious and that the second part is franticly piecing together bits of information.  Maybe I listened to one part of a movie for two seconds just in passing, and then I rewound back to the beginning. When the movie continued my mind was still locked on those initial two seconds when they arrived half an hour later (like Deja Vu in a different language)?  Maybe certain social situations get repeated and only four or five phrases would suffice, causing my mind to predict them before they happen?

If this happened to anyone else let me know, it trips me out a bit. Otherwise thank you Khazumoto for looking at language development as a specific lifestyle instead of something out of a book or random audio cd.  If anyone is new to this site and questioning the methods, just do it, like Nike. Don&#039;t be a baby and accept everything as it comes, hard work will get you further to where you want to be.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad to see this post and this series which I haven&#039;t read before.  Very good reading when on the long road of intermediate.

Strangely discovered that after recently hitting 2700 hanzi (90% done!) it&#039;s leaving me feeling glass half empty rather than glass half full.  It&#039;s taken nearly 12 months to get here and I feel like the big goal is still a long way ahead.

Gonna focus on just doing another 100 a week for the next 3 weeks.  Then whatever comes next comes next.  

Also, you linked to a video on TED and I&#039;ve discovered that some of the videos have Chinese subtitles now.  Awesome.  Can turn the sound down and watch them to my hearts content.]]></description>
