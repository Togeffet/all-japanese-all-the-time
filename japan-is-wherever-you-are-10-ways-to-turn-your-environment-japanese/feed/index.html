					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been trying to immerse my self since 2009. Movies - done. Music - done. Food - done. Furniture - done to the best of my ability. I have 4 kids though, ages now almost 2 - 13. Where I have been trying to teach them words and such in Japanese (e.g. „ÅÑ„Åü„Å†„Åç„Åæ„ÅôÔºÅ), I don&#039;t think I can go &quot;speak all in Japanese and nothing else!&quot; or my kids aren&#039;t going to understand anything I&#039;m saying. Perhaps maybe say it in English and then also In Japanese? I don&#039;t know enough to just spout off &quot;PUT ON YOUR SHOES WE HAVE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW THE BUS IS COMING YOU&#039;RE GOING TO BE LATE RAWWR!!&quot; Hm.. so then maybe I should learn all my screaming ahead of time? Haha! Any suggestions? XD]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I modded my current dining room table into the low Japanese style table. I just took the existing legs off, and went to my local hardware store and bought new legs. I painted them black to at least sort of match, and put them on the table. It was a really easy process. Then I bought some big &quot;floor pillows&quot; as I have seen them called in the US at least, at bed bath and beyond to use as my seats. :) Hope that helps! Not sure where you live, but I&#039;m sure other stores may have big pillows you can use as well. Good luck!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello!!
I love this, it&#039;s great advice! I&#039;ve followed this as much as I can.¬† My bedroom is my Japanese zone.¬† Everything Japanese down to the core.¬† Only Japanese spoken, listened, watched etc.¬† (I live with my mother, so I have to speak English to her or else she starts complaining the entire time and it just gets out of hand.) 
But my question is, do you think it&#039;s a good idea to have &#039;english&#039; hours?¬† Like, if you completely immerse yourself in a Japanese enviroment and you continue to do so for days-weeks-etc, is it alright if you &#039;earn&#039; an hour of English whatever?¬† Like an hour of English music or English videogames, etc?¬† As long as the person goes straight back into Japanese after that complete 60 minutes(with a timer)?¬† 
I haven&#039;t done that yet.¬† This is actually the only English I&#039;ve spoken/typed all day.¬† I love Japanese too much to not do it unless the sentences I&#039;m thinking of are way off my radar.¬† 
¬†
Any other advice would be great :)¬† 
¬†
PS- I do still have my English novels out (*Smacks hands in punishment*) but they&#039;re taped off with off limits tape XD I&#039;ve been good about not touching them. I have many Japanese novels that I bought while I was in Kobe, so I keep to those or my study books.]]></description>

I did try NicoNicoDouga making an account on there but keep getting an error..that says This URL became invalid because of expiration(24 hours) or already completed registration.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit worried my love for Disney/Dreamworks animated movies and books is going to interfere with setting up a Japanese environment xD. Since I&#039;m just a poor high school student, I can&#039;t really afford to get those movies dubbed in Japanese and it doesn&#039;t seem like they have any good torrent sites like TPB in Japan (poor guys), so I have to settle for the English versions. Well, I managed to find some movies in Japanese on Nico Nico, but it&#039;s still a fraction of those I like to watch. ¬†
And books. As much as I&#039;d like to get books in Japanese, a similar problem - lack of money. 
Well, for now, I&#039;m off to look for a Japanese radio... ¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It sounds like the issue isn&#039;t that they disapprove of you learning Japanese, they just believe in the old fashioned &quot;Text books are the only way you can learn&quot; theory.

Maybe you need to ease them in? Get your hands on RTK, sit down at the kitchen table, and start working on it. If your Mom asks what you&#039;re doing, I&#039;ve got a feeling that she&#039;ll actually believe you&#039;re doing Japanese. 

Then, later on, perhaps play Japanese tunes while you work. She may ask, &quot;what kind of music is that?&quot;, and you can tell her Japanese. She may or may not like the music, but she&#039;ll probably believe you. 

Then, start SRSing, so when she sees you on the computer, you can show her the Kanji from the book on the screen. This may be the crossover thing that allows you to be seen on the computer, and to actually be thought of as doing Japanese. 

And hopefully it&#039;ll just go from there. I&#039;m fortunate that my parents are supportive of my Japanese interests, so by not experiencing your dilemma first hand, my advice may be useless, but still, I hope it at least leads you in the right direction!]]></description>

<p>Then, later on, perhaps play Japanese tunes while you work. She may ask, &#8220;what kind of music is that?&#8221;, and you can tell her Japanese. She may or may not like the music, but she&#8217;ll probably believe you. </p>
<p>Then, start SRSing, so when she sees you on the computer, you can show her the Kanji from the book on the screen. This may be the crossover thing that allows you to be seen on the computer, and to actually be thought of as doing Japanese. </p>
<p>And hopefully it&#8217;ll just go from there. I&#8217;m fortunate that my parents are supportive of my Japanese interests, so by not experiencing your dilemma first hand, my advice may be useless, but still, I hope it at least leads you in the right direction!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Food is a big part of culture, so probably yes. With Japanese, it&#039;s a good idea to go beyond the stereotypical teriyaki and california roll. and go for real ÂíåÈ£ü.
