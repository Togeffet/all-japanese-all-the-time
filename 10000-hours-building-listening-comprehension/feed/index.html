					<description><![CDATA[yeah, i&#039;m  using wanikani now, which is wonderful. its not drilling, its srs like you hear about so much and works so much better, its been not a month and now i have a set of 2 or 300 kanji and vocab which i KNOW. i mean have it down, permanently. and i also go through and read and figure out japanese sentences like i said, which constantly reinforces it. i&#039;m working on the peripherals like you said, mostly with music, and also i&#039;m labeling things in my room with sticky notes. i just go through this japanese app/textbook on my phone in free time for fun and to pick up vocab, learn irregularities,learn about culture, etc. and this is what&#039;s worked for me. 

and as far as kanji, the idea i got from wanikani is: just learn one reading, whichever you deem most important, and simply include that in your mnemonic story. it doesn&#039;t require ANY extra work and you then have a name for the kanji plus can guess at it&#039;s pronunciation in vocab.

then later on as you learn vocab, you learn the other readings. and just mix that in with kanji studying, along with reading sentences and paying attention to music lyrics. like there was this song i&#039;ve listened to since i was little, called Nagareboshi. i&#039;m just a beginner so i didn&#039;t pick up that much, but the first line: &quot;Sora wo miagereba&quot; &quot;if you look at the sky&quot; i understood that and was like &quot;whoa!!! (*ﾟ∀ﾟ)=3&quot;

i think that reading can be very rewarding and should be done as much as possible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, I&#039;m not Khatz, but I would *strongly* recommend to start with finishing your kanji. Kanji are the absolute key to learning Japanese, and without them, there isn&#039;t much point in trying to read. From personal experience, I think if you focus too much on doing other things before or during your kanji phase, you&#039;ll make the process of learning them too drawn out and will make a shaky foundation to build the rest of your Japanese on. 

In my humble opinion, I would recommend you start by setting yourself up to make the kanji go by as quickly as possible (ie check out Heisig&#039;s books, set up an SRS, try to utilize pre-built decks).

Perhaps more controversially, I would also recommend that you just worry about the peripheral aspects of a Japanese immersion environment for now. So things like music, background noise, Japanese posters, chopsticks, etc. Save the active learning for later.

Of course this is only my advice from my own experience, so it may not work for you, but then again, you asked the question, so I hope you find the answer useful :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khaz, all this stuff is so amazing but like where do i start?? I&#039;m just beginning, i can use basic state-of-being sentences and i&#039;ve got about 100 kanji down. I&#039;ve got childrens books that i like to read and i make it a habit to just read things i see aloud, it helps a lot with kanji especially readings, along with sort of having a clue on what things sound like. But basically my question is, where, or more importantly, when, do i start? I&#039;ve got my phone on japanese now and i&#039;&#039;m starting to learn all the different things as well, so im starting to learn, but i&#039;m missing a LOT of vocabulary and since there isn&#039;t really a way to look up kanji other than copy/pasting which i cant do. so a whole heap of the stuff doesn&#039;t make any sense to me. so at what point in my learning should i start putting everything in japanese? should i go ahead and do it now anyway?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[the fact that japanese is entering your brain in a consistent stream is more than enough.  active participation with the language can speed up comprehension, but its hardly possible to do that 24/7.  so just enjoy the ride, it&#039;ll come.  dont forget the kanji and mcds to go along with it]]></description>

Would I learn more if I actively listen, because at this moment, all I&#039;m doing is listening passive it seems.]]></description>
