					<description><![CDATA[Japanese with a Korean accent is quite interesting. Korean with a Japanese accent is also quite interesting. It&#039;s not always cute, though.

I saw a &#039;내 아내의 모든 것&#039; in the theaters the other week. At the beginning of the movie they were in Japan. Obviously the actors&#039; Japanese was about as good as Jim Carey&#039;s Korean. However, I didn&#039;t think their Japanese was very cute at all.  

About the beauty tips, if you come to Korea, you might notice many girls looking at mirrors in coffee shops (or anywhere) whereas when I went to Japan, I saw many girls(and guys) reading books in coffee shops. This obsession with beauty in Korea kinda creeps me out. ]]></description>
