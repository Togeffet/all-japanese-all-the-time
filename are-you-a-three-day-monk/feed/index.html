					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s fun for you about Japanese?  Do that. Do as much of that as you like, but no more. Find other fun things and do them, too. Is there some way you can just make Japanese part of your environment? Do that.
I tollowed the typical arc of most J-learner-forgetters. I took classes for about a year, they became too much of a chore, I stopped studying.
But I never stopped watching (subtitled) ドラマ, and years later I re-started studying. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;d have stopped again if I hadn&#039;t stumbled across AJATT. There&#039;s nifty stuff here about SRSes and sentence mining and all that but absolutely the most important thing for me here was the notion that I could play. I could eat all the Japanese junk food I wanted. I could chain-click random Japanese music videos until I found stuff I liked. I could spend my free time browsing h.hatene.ne.jp or other Japanese twitter-like things. The world, it turns out, is my oyster.
Folks are motivated by different things. There was someone in one of my classes who absolutely loved studying keigo for a month. I found it super frustrating to be stalled on something I had only a passing interest in. (And so I loved in Karei Naru Spy when Tomoya Nagase&#039;s character is told to use keigo when addressing the PM; 「しらねえな、そんな日本語。」) Things that make Japanese not fun will make you want to do something not-Japanese.
Have fun. Be a mess. Have japanese bookmarks so you can look at stuff whenever. Keep Anki open and do a couple of minutes when you&#039;re idle. Carry Japanese reading material with you. Watch trashy J-TV. Learn Japanese songs and sing in the shower. Make what&#039;s fun about Japanese something that&#039;s always (or as always as you can make it) accessible. A little Japanese every day is better than a lot followed by none.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I understand how you feel! I think the answer to your question - how to not be a 3-day monk - is instead of making Japanese a planned activity, just apply Japanese as the working language to things you already do. Do you use your computer? Use it with a Japanese OS. Do you watch anime? Watch it in Japanese (without English subs). Of course this is easier said than done, but if you continue reading this website, you&#039;ll find a path to doing it that will suit your needs. 
 
lol I&#039;m not sure if what I said will help or scare you off from trying.... if it makes it any better, remember, you did learn at least one language this way already, so I *know* you can do it again :)

Like with the gym, I do it during a month and I&#039;m out, always. I love languages, but I wanna improve my english, learn more french and learn japanese again, I&#039;ve forgot most of it.
The thing is, I&#039;m trying to learn how to not be a 3-day-monk, this was the first time I heard about it but it&#039;s perfect to describe, but I really don&#039;t know how.]]></description>
