					<description><![CDATA[Hmm, I already did RTK1, mastered keyword -&#062; components production via RevTK site, but didn&#039;t practice handwriting and recognition is pretty weak (the &quot;only practice production and recognition will take care of itself&quot; theory didn&#039;t really pan out in my case)
¬†
Furthermore, I&#039;m an SS early adopter and now halfway through RTK1 via SS schedule.... of course, since I&#039;ve seen them all before it goes quite fast, and the majority of them are quickly scheduled off into the distant future thanks to the magic of SRS. But I do get structured writing practice this time, and the act of writing has really helped my recognition and &quot;completed the circle&quot;, gluing together the english / japanese / production / recognition / composite / component skills into unified &quot;knowledge&quot;.
¬†
So while the thought of jumping ahead 100 days appeals to me, and I am eager to get on to the next stage, I feel like it would be good for me (dangerous concept, I know!) to keep on my current path and cement the rest of the kanji (it doesn&#039;t take much time out of the day, I&#039;m mostly immersing anyway) rather than switch horses midstream.¬† Feel free to second-guess this decision, that&#039;s what I&#039;m paying you for.
¬†
I guess my other question is about &quot;Forbidden Japanese&quot; sentence packs... I assume these will be the starter J&#060;-&#062;E sentences we use when we get to the JE sentence stage, and I&#039;m assuming from-scratch silverspooners will be on pretty much the same path once we reach that stage. Will silverspooners be given access to this sentence content when the time comes??]]></description>
