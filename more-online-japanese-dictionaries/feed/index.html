					<description><![CDATA[Hello man, 

All the japanese-japanese dictinaries are great, have them bookmarked for later use when I will go cold turkey. But first I need to use english as a springboard. For which I&#039;ll need a japanese-english dictionary (electronic!, tis not a typing contest as I recall) to get correct sentences (besides the grammar sites and books recommended to get a firm grip on the grammar - without the explanations of course, only sentences). I have read here somewhere that the yahoo dictionary is pretty good and has good example sentences. Two questions:

1. By yahoo dictionary, is it meant this one?:
http://babelfish.yahoo.com/

if not, which one is it?

2. Any other great japanese - english dictionary (for sentences)? (online or software is fine I can get it).

Thankxszxz a lot. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[(I was originally posting in the sanseido entry but I&#039;ll move it here for more logical sense.)  Over the past couple of days I&#039;ve used the sanseido, yahoo, and goo and I still can&#039;t figure out where the usage/example sentences are.  I can get the definitions.  After I looked at this post I figured out how to use the infoseek to get usages of the word in newspapers and I think with goo I figured out how to get to wikipedia for it.  Where am I going wrong with this?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right, the Yahoo dic is really good. I have it on the links on the sidebar. I discovered it long after writing this article, so it didn&#039;t seem worth it to make the addition here. But thanks for pointing that out!]]></description>
