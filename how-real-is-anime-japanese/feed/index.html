-All Disney and Pixar films if you like cartoons
-Mr. Robot
-Fringe
-Friends

-There is just so much I can still add to the list. Maybe do a Google (Yahoo/Bing/gizoogle/whatever search engine you use) search to find more series and movies and stuff. Good luck with your language learning.

Anyway, do you happen to know some good Dutch (Nederlands) content for me to watch?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Crazy People (count me in),
Actually I&#039;m learning more about english than japanese yet and as a matter of fact, that&#039;s the best occasion I&#039;ve been given to improve my english so far. Then thanks a lot.
Well tha&#039;ts not the point. Here it is: I&#039;m not an anime nerd. Not at all. I need advice to get introduced to this wonderful world. 
I&#039;m not completely disconnected as I know a few ones like Miyazaki&#039;s movies or The Cat returns... 
I love the Monthy Pythons, nonsense humour, Sci Fi, everything epic or legendary, with a lot of suspense and drama.
Please help me! What could fit my taste?
Thanks in advance :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like to think about about anime-based audio immersion this way: you are incidentally training to be a professional voice actor. And if you&#039;re &lt;em&gt;shadowing&lt;/em&gt;, then you&#039;re already an aspiring understudy. It contains the same challenges and pitfalls--the threat of being type cast, not being able to get into the character, not being able to understand the character&#039;s motivations from one scene to the next, not having a wide enough repertoire, etc. The biggest pitfall is getting chased out of the business before you get a chance to play a part at all.

What would be pretty abhorrent to me: having to play the understudy for a textbook dialogue voiceover artist. And people saying that&#039;s the only damn way I&#039;m going to learn. Maybe that&#039;s just my experience with textbook dialogues and there&#039;s some really riveting stuff out there. (The closest I&#039;ve seen in any language were the readings in the Cambridge Latin books--dogs dancing on the table, drunken &lt;em&gt;ancillae&lt;/em&gt;, death and betrayal--all sort of crazy stuff.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally, I think that there&#039;s a ton of myths concerning anime around the Japanese language community. I don&#039;t have the experience of being one of those exclusive anime guys, but even if I were, I couldn&#039;t see it having the detrimental effect talked about by some people. Like the other commenter said, anime itself, no, even an anime SERIES itself provides variety. Think of the various speech styles, dialects, characters and slang a single series can have.

In my opinion, it doesn&#039;t matter how &quot;real&quot; it is. I don&#039;t want others to find themselves reading a newspaper article that they would never read just because some guy on the internet says not to learn from anime and manga.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would be careful taking what a teacher told you as the only authority. The reason is that there&#039;s no way she can tell you everything. At best, you&#039;re going to get adult guidance, which is fine, but is there anyone who hasn&#039;t rebelled again adult guidance at least a little? Do you really want to end up using &quot;四角張った&quot; language all the time? That&#039;s just as bad as being dramatic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree.

I would say probably 75% of my audio is Anime, yet tons of Japanese people I talk with say I speak super naturally and that there is no　違和感.

So the whole thing with anime-japanese not being that real, I find to be false.
My Japanese self was born and raised on anime, and if all these people say that I am speaking perfectly, something must be going right. Of course, perhaps it&#039;s one huge conspiracy and they just want to make me feel good so I get a false impression and then tell my boss 自分でやれ、この野郎！

Once you get good enough, your style of speaking is more of a choice anyways, just like it is in your native language. You won&#039;t be formal papers with the &quot;gonna&quot; or &quot;I&#039;ma go...&quot; in English, so why would you do the same in Japanese?

I use slang like no other, but when it comes time to use formal language, you gotta use it. 

Most people who say the whole deal about anime, are usually not that good with Japanese in the first place. If you were good with Japanese, you would know the differences and how/when to use them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, that is knowledge that you pick up by just reading or watching stuff that isn&#039;t just anime. If your basis for the language is anime, that doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t know how to read a mood or to determine when certain phrases are appropriate or not.
By the time your Japanese is at a level to really get into trouble for not using it appropriately, you&#039;ll know the nuances (to an extent) of certain words and probably wouldn&#039;t use them unless it was intentionally.

Honestly, I&#039;ve had more feedback from Japanese people on the vocabulary that I picked up from the news than I have from anime. They tell me it isn&#039;t really used except for... well, in the the news.

You&#039;ll pick up a different flavor of Japanese no matter what the material you use to study it with. These flavors will balance each other out, and you can choose the one that you like the most. You can get lots of different flavors from anime alone. I find it unlikely that someone will solely experience Japanese through anime anyway... and if they do, why should they even care if it is &#039;real&#039; or not?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So just like American movies, shows in Japan can be over dramatize. I have this kid who watches anime and comes and asks the teacher questions in class. Granted yes some shows do similar things sometimes in real life, majority of the time it&#039;s over dramatic. My teacher is from Tokyo and currently here working on her masters while teaching. She lets us know when we can drop certain words at certain times due to the relationship between the people talking but she teaches us beyond the textbook. So I would say no it&#039;s not that real. Yes it&#039;s Japanese but you have to take in consideration the characters relationship, which dialect they are using or based off of and some words in anime are not commonly used.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh Khatsumoto! You know you are just encouraging the kids who make (and presumably beleive) comments like &quot;Nobody says desu&quot; 

Real live Japanese people talk just like in the text books- some of the time. 

Sure, you don&#039;t want to be a walking text book with no other registers at your disposal.

At the same time you don&#039;t want to be without the ability to use that stuff. Unless you intend to be 13 forever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really?

Wow, that&#039;s amazing.  I&#039;ll be sure to use my phrases I learned from fansubs!

It&#039;s weird that online dictionaries tell me &quot;onna&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;F###ing bitch!&quot; and &quot;yameru&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;Epic fail!&quot;  though..

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m working at a Japanese High School and some of my kids use anime-inspired vocabulary. Or language that&#039;s too casual　○○先生いますか？ instead of ○○先生いらっしゃいますか. The teachers correct them. That&#039;s part of growing up.

We&#039;re all starting off as Japanese babies, we need to have our childhood before we can grow up.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve learned much of my French from a strange mix of sources: graphic novels, science fiction translated from English, humor websites, science documentaries, and even political philosophy from the early 1800s. (Hey, don&#039;t knock it, it&#039;s actually pretty interesting.)

After a while, it all sort of balances out. If I want to spend a few months reading graphic novels or science fiction, no problem. That gives me a nice, predictable &quot;niche&quot; that I can learn in depth. Eventually I get bored and go try something else.

After a while, it becomes really obvious that some words are very formal, and some words are very slangy. For example, &quot;interpellé par la police&quot; starts to sound like &quot;arrested by the police&quot;, and &quot;chopé par les flics&quot; starts to sound like &quot;busted by the cops&quot;, because they each appear in certain contexts. Even in a single cop show, there&#039;s judges, police officers, coroners, and criminals, and each speaks a little differently.

But overall, it&#039;s all the same language. Once you can understand *any* genre fluently, everything else just requires a little bit of exposure and you&#039;ll adjust in no time flat. It&#039;s like growing up in a small US town and watching Monty Python for the first time—sure, they speak funny, but after an hour, it&#039;s no problem at all and you can already imitate them a little bit.

So read and watch whatever you want. When you get bored, try something else.]]></description>
