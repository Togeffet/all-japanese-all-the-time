					<description><![CDATA[I was just wondering, when you have this kanji file, is it ok to use the stories from there, or is it a big part of the process to make you&#039;re own stories? Using these stories would save a lot of time, and they seem to have good stories, but is it just a fake shortcut?]]></description>

I now know that those characters stands for &#039;yourself&#039;. But I don&#039;t understand how to say it. Let&#039;s say I&#039;m watching Japanese TV show and someone says &#039;jibun&#039;. I wouldn&#039;t understand the meaning of that. 

I&#039;m confused how to start my Japanese learning, should I write my cards in romaji?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Juz098, Ima

I say use whatever method you feel most comfortable with.  If writing down a kanji several times will help better embed your story into your head, then all will be well.  Everyone will end up using the SRS&#039; repitions to remember them anyway, so as long as you get the story down, you&#039;re on your way.

I used a similar method, only I really like being able to write the kanji down prettily(?).  So, I wrote them down as many times as it took to get a nice looking character.  Did the extra time help with memorizing?  I&#039;d like to say so.  If a particular kanji took a while to write nicely, I remembered it a lot more easily when it came up in review.

And, of course, when reviewing, practice writing the kanji down at least once, making sure the number of strokes and their order are correct.  Since you&#039;re gonna be reviewing everyday, I suggest using your finger and palm instead of pen/paper.

Hope this helped!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using the Heisig method to learn Kanji. I&#039;m 17 lessons in and the method I&#039;ve been using so far is, read the kanji story, write the kanji 5 or 6 times and then input it into my SRS. With that method I get through about 24 kanji a day on average. The I realized, should I be writing it out or is that a big waste of time? Should I just write it out say once and then input it in to my SRS? Which method would you say is the better one?]]></description>
