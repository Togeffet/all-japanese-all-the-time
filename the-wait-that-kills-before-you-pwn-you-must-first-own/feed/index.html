					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard some people recommend starting off with picture books, others will recommend manga, but what I would say is get anything that interests you. If you like Harry Potter, maybe try looking for a Japanese version of it. At least in my opinion, it doesn&#039;t matter what you decide to read, as long as it&#039;s something you actually *want* to read. 
 
As for finding books, the easy answer is amazon.co.jp, but there are other websites, as well as probably some places local to you that may sell used books. 
 
I hope this helps!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I say skip the books [for now at least]. I for one have little funds to be constantly buying dead-tree books... So I invested in the Kindle. Single best purchase I&#039;ve ever made. I now have books on my person [and it can be in the thousands, at that] with one slim piece of plastic. It weighs less than a pound, and the battery lasts for a month off charge! Best of all, you can get your &quot;books&quot; for free, Instapapering japanese articles and websites and sending it to your self! Man, Kindle is on fire!]]></description>

You can try these sites:
http://nnr3.dojin.com/
http://www.newvel.jp/
http://www.yomimono.net/shousetuyomi/
http://works.bookstudio.com/

The first link is mainly romance novel for ladies. :P The others have genres like mystery, sci-fic, and fantasy. What I like is that those are light novels and it&#039;s fun to read, even to beginners. And sometimes you can even learn the latest word trends. :P
Hope you find something you like. :P]]></description>
