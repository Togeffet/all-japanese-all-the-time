					<description><![CDATA[My upper limit for immersion in my target language is 10 hours a day. It doesn&#039;t mean that I don&#039;t ever do 14 hours of listening a day--it&#039;s a rare occurrence tho. It&#039;s not that I get headaches or anything--it&#039;s just that I need some silence, and that I can&#039;t walk around with earphones on when I&#039;m in college. I figured that if I get about 5 to 6 hours of immersion a day, I&#039;m good to go. However, I would NOT recommend people who have just started out to use the same method. You need to be used to your target language if you want to take breaks without hurting yourself. I mean, I don&#039;t feel like using my native language anymore so I&#039;m fine if I take a break for a couple of hours. My OS is in my target languages and so are my books and my music. I can&#039;t go wrong because I&#039;m surrounded by my L2. Moreover, I&#039;ve already raked in about 2,500 hours of immersion and probably even more but I was too lazy to keep a decent log over the years.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d just like to add that I vouch for the &quot;input of target language.&quot; My Japanese is very poor, beginner and such, but I listen to my Japanese diligently. I spent a lot of my winter break listening to Japanese and watching Japanese movies, even though I understand next to none of it, and it really helped. I cheated, of course, I used subs, but I can honestly say that two weeks later, I am a lot more comfortable with spoken Japanese, and watching the same movies or similar ones without subs, I understood what was happening better and realized I actually had expanded my vocabulary. Hahaha, I must say that my confidence in this method has been greatly boosted. It produces nearly instant results, or at least, it did for me! (Except for the sub thing: I know English subs aren&#039;t suggested, but I really couldn&#039;t resist, and for me personally, it helped.)

Anyways, that&#039;s my input in the matter. Japanese gets more fun each day!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[JDOG!!!

www.bookmooch.com is a free book exchange program. Basically you get rid of books you have and get books you want. Everyone pays outgoing shipping (about $2.50), no one pays incoming shipping. For every book you send out, you can get a book in.

You can search for books by language, so I just search for books in Japanese. I&#039;ve gotten 4 different mangas. I don&#039;t read manga in English, so I don&#039;t really care what I&#039;m reading in Japanese. I look up the books to see what they&#039;re about and if it&#039;s not too sci-fi-y then I&#039;ll mooch it. It&#039;s pretty sweet.

Also, check out ebay. There&#039;s lots of Japanese books on there, especially kids books.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Interesting, it does seem like defeatism is endemic in language learning and I think it is one of the major reasons why adults have such a low success rate in learning languages.

Wan Zafran,

On the point of avoiding thinking in your native langauge, I recall hearing from another that that is one of the major reasons why for adults the Antimoon/AJATT method is supposed to not work.  I personally do not buy this argument, but the other person said that through this method, as an adult, you will either impose a meaning from an equivalent word or phrase from your native language on a word or phrase in the target language, or you will remain eternally clueless as to the meaning of that word or phrase.  When I told them that grammar books give lots of explanations in your native language and not target language, they responded saying, &quot;Yes, but you will have the correct meaning, unlike what you would impose from your native language.&quot;  I also told them that a necessary part of immerson is hearing the sentences all in the target language and they responded saying that it doesn&#039;t matter, since it would all be one big fog anyway.  I told them that gradually as time goes on, the fog clears, and I&#039;ve checked my interpretations of the meanings of various words (that I got simply from watching/listening/reading, not by looking it up in a monolingual/bilingual dictionary) and generally they say that my interpretations of those words were correct.

The person has yet to respond and has not done so for quite a while.

I think defeatism is so endemic that people are willing to try the methods that seem more socially correct, like the-go-to-school-to-hear-translations-from-your-native-language-and-grammar-that-works-best-with-your-native-language&#039;s-grammar-explained-in-your-native-language-so-you-can-grind-out-sentences-from-that-because-as-we-all-know-you-are-an-adult-therefore-you-can-never-understand-from-reading-or-listening-no-matter-how-much-you-do-for-how-long-or-what-space-of-time-so-quit-being-facetious-and-who-cares-if-you-can&#039;t-understand-the-average-monolingual-native-speaker&#039;s-response-because-they&#039;re-bigots-for-not-knowing-how-to-deal-with-foreigners-anyway method.  But seriously, the sentences that I learned in school always seemed to be rare finds in the actual things I listen to/read.  In other words, I learned a whole bunch of sentences from school and then I set to read actual Japanese and I understand barely any of it--here and there I can find one I learned in school, but on the whole the Japanese themselves use completely different ways of writing.

But I find that understanding becomes easier as time goes on and so I will continue this method.

I&#039;m in Japan presently, though I will return home on the 9th and I find that I can understand the things people say better, though not perfectly and I still get taken by surprise.  My accent is thick though still, and I try to avoid speaking and when I get home I&#039;m going to return to another self-imposed silent period that I hope will help followed by more close and intense practice to sound like a native speaker.  As a child I was hyperlexic and though I could read very well, I found it difficult to understand spoken speech.  Because of that, I expect that it would probably take longer for my listening skills to kick in than the average person, so it is a weak spot that I am working on getting caught up in.

Thank you Khatzumoto and Antimoon for this common-sensical method that I had some vague idea of being the thing I should do before I even heard of it.  Thank you. ^_^]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#062;Let me ask you, though — how long did it take you to get to your current level of French?

it took me about two years.
-though I didn&#039;t follow your method exactly I followed the main points 
&quot;sentences&quot;- I didn&#039;t input them into any SRS I just read and read some more and read some more. which gave me input of well over 10,000 sentences I just didn&#039;t have to take the time putting them into my SRS, and instead of reviewing my SRS, I read some more. 

anyway cheers =]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[LoL S&amp;M...

One thing I&#039;m afraid of happening, something which hasn&#039;t actually happened yet, is people going &quot;I can&#039;t learn in such a short time because I can&#039;t take the heat&quot;...I call that weakness in the sense of being a wuss-pot [hmmm...that was redundant...]. For the record, no one here has been a wuss-pot, no-one has been whining. But I&#039;m just deathly afraid of anything that acts as a portal to those ideas, ideas that permit just half-a$$edness, you know? Probably because I&#039;ve been a very big whiner myself, so I find the whole whining deal very distasteful...It&#039;s at the base of people spending, you know years &quot;studying&quot; a language with nothing to show for it: having been in that position I can attest to how pathetic the whole thing is. There is no good reason for it. Dragging ones feet, underachievement...theres&#039;s no reason for it. Not that anyone here but me has been an underachiever. I guess I&#039;m just concerned about some kind of slippery slope into mediocrity, and some kind of decision that &quot;only certain people can do X&quot;, that kind of self-imposed elitism really grates on me, personally. These are the bad attitudes, the unexamined decisions, the unconquered vices that are at the base of most people&#039;s language learning problems, so I&#039;m just wary of things that even seem to hint at those attitudes.

I&#039;m usually not one to suggest distasteful things (I&#039;m not, really), but...maybe this uncomfortable period is something to just buckle down and ride through? It won&#039;t last forever, like I said Japanese becomes a habit -- eventually you just do it because it&#039;s what you do. It may well be a matter of using willpower until a new habit is formed (at which point willpower is no longer needed). And while on the subject of willpower, I think it actually takes LESS willpower to do Japanese all the time, than to do Japanese &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time. At some point if you want to get to your destination in time you may just have to run there and darn the pain and darn the excuses and darn the consequences...if your life were in danger you would figure something out by hook or by crook, and when it comes to a relatively large project like learning a language, that same moment-to-moment, what&#039;s the word -- force, impetus, drive... -- can be very useful and can be applied quite easily. The buck has to stop somewhere, right? Better here and now than later, because let me tell you -- regret is a good deal more painful than temporary discomfort. You realize that a

At some point if you want to get to your destination in time you may just have to run there and darn the pain and darn the excuses and darn the consequences&#8230;if your life were in danger you would figure something out by hook or by crook, and when it comes to a relatively large project like learning a language, that same moment-to-moment, what&#8217;s the word &#8212; force, impetus, drive&#8230; &#8212; can be very useful and can be applied quite easily. The buck has to stop somewhere, right? Better here and now than later, because let me tell you &#8212; regret is a good deal more painful than temporary discomfort. You realize that a</p>
<p>LoL&#8230;well that was negative 🙂 !! But sometimes&#8230;you just have to get raw, man.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[lol, learning a language is indeed boiling water (so you can later make a nice stew).  In my own personal experience, I was exposed to Italian constantly for a few months each year, and took huge breaks. It turned out fine, but it took a decade or more. If your body needs rest or silence, listen to it. You can let go of the pot but it&#039;s still simmering and your brain is processing. A few hours of rest is exactly what you need. There are forms of torture that involve constant sound and the outcome is not pretty. However if one&#039;s body &quot;craves&quot; English, that&#039;s just silly talk. Practice another language - if you&#039;re in the mood for it. Or do whatever you want. Khatzumoto will soon hate my guts :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Haha, I&#039;m just saying that reading in Japanese, listening to lots of Japanese causes me to get actual headaches. I won&#039;t say it isn&#039;t getting better with time, but I can totally see why someone would say they feel like they need a break. Hell, sometimes it&#039;s just a necessity. Calling that a weakness or a failure just seems to be too negative to me. Unless you&#039;re into S&#038;M or something. :D

Man, I really need to find a Japanese forum to spend my time arguing on. (And no one say 2ch. That is such a mess to navigate through!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Then again, everyone&#039;s different, right? Apparently some people can handle dubs (me), some people can handle subs (Chiro-kun) and some people can&#039;t handle either (Oliver). Similarly, some people can handle stops (Oliver) and some people can&#039;t (me).

Just do whatever is fun. I find it hard to fathom how it could be that physically distasteful to have 100% target language input since it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what we did as kids...but that may just be a lack of imagination on my part...if it can&#039;t be helped then it can&#039;t be helped. People may well just be different in that sense. I would advise you to TRY 100% 24/7/365 input in some form, but if you need silence, you need silence [some people can&#039;t sleep with it...other people need meditative time during the day...whatever].

I mean...stops occur naturally for most people (I lived in the US; I had to handle business in English at times), so...it would seem to me that that would provide enough time off iff such time off is in fact necessary. But...I mean, if you spend 15 waking hours doing Japanese and you intentionally and voluntarily (out of active desire as opposed to necessity) give up 1 hour to something else, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re still doing fine.

Let 100 flowers bloom. Let everyone go figure out their own deal. I&#039;m going to stick to my way, but variations are naturally going to occur, and even if they cause me to raise an eyebrow of avuncular concern, that of course doesn&#039;t by any means automatically mean they&#039;re not going to work. I do think it&#039;s easier from a self-/time-management perspective to say &quot;all my time is now for language X&quot;, but...if one is a better self-manager or time-manager, then a more complex, nuanced scheme should also be possible, I&#039;m sure.

あけおめことよろ by the way :)

Oh one more thing -- I have an article coming up in just under 12 hours about overcoming burn out, which is what I think this is really all about. In it, I&#039;ll discuss how to overcome burnout &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; skipping a single moment in terms of being immersed in your target language (esp. Japanese). Again, I heartily recommend 100% commitment as opposed to taking time off; I think a 100% commitment is easy and fun and totally do-able, but I do respect the people who are for breaking give them the benefit of the doubt. Ultimately, this is a matter of personal responsibility -- you want fluency, you do what you need to do, end of story.]]></description>

If it&#039;s to leave TV/music on in the background, that&#039;s something I&#039;ve spent 25 years prior not doing because it&#039;s an annoyance to me. But, silence is alas the exact opposite of language input so whaddaya gonna do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! This is the first time I&#039;ve had a chance to look at the response to my question I posted 24 hours ago now. Interesting debate between Oliver and Khatzumoto.  I have to say that I like the idea of making Japanese the joyous part so that you don&#039;t feel you have to take breaks from it. I would say that I enjoy the music and just browsing what I can understand in my newly bought manga (I did find a shop that sells Japanese manga on the other side of town!), but I just don&#039;t like how much time it takes to enter all those kanji into my SRS, but I know that it&#039;ll probably be even longer when I have to do sentences. I wish the kanji part would move a little quicker! Anyway, thanks for the ideas and advice. I also wish I could listen in my sleep, but I have tried multiple times and I just have to turn it off to be able to sleep well. Otherwise it&#039;s not as good of a sleep for me. Maybe if I just keep doing it, I could get used to it, like sleeping with a fan on when I was a kid to block out the noise. idk...happy new year!]]></description>
