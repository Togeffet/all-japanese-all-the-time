					<description><![CDATA[Downloading a pirated file is illegal.  However, streaming media is the responsibility of the hosting site.  (This is why Youtube is so heavy-handed in taking down videos.)  So, no, viewing media on NicoNico isn&#039;t illegal.  (Note: I am not a lawyer.)  That said, it&#039;s always *better* to buy media if you can, because it leads to more good media being made.
 
(But frankly, until media companies wake up and stop making legal purchases easier (ie., no region-encoding) I&#039;m not going to have much sympathy for them.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That is true, but it wasn&#039;t the case here (Valve Software is an American company ;) But most servers are user-hosted). I think the whole &quot;use pinglimits to keep overseas players out without explicitly banning 外国人/외국인&quot; was (hopefully) just for server stability instead of deliberately keeping non-Koreans out. When one player has bad ping, the whole server suffers to a certain extent (not to mention &quot;I was behind the wall, that Sniper&#039;s using noclip bullets!&quot;).
Especially that the gamemode in question was Pyro Dodgeball (use airblasts to reflect homing rockets at the other team), and since rockets aren&#039;t lag compensated, it causes even more issues for high-ping players.

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, very helpful. The other problem I&#039;ve been having trying to figure out this thing is that not only is the video player a weird version of Flash (so Rikaichan won&#039;t work on it), but even the text in the comment list can&#039;t be selected.
I just wish there was a related-videos list as well, not just to follow a series, but also to watch whatever else looks interesting...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would suggest getting involved in Korean ClubBox communities.  That seems to be the primary way files are shared over there.  I have never found a legitimate Korean P2P program (other than ClubBox if you count that), torrent site, etc.

Now, if you just want native Korean media, there are toooons of places to get all of that.  In 1080p no less.

But for dubbed foreign material I would imagine you need to go more native.  If you can function in Korean, try poking around on Naver for different people&#039;s ClubBoxes :)  Or I think you can also search within the program or something. ]]></description>
