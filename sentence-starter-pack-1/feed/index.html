					<description><![CDATA[Yo, just thought I&#039;d throw up an example of one of my own all-japanese cards for people to see as well....sorry if it&#039;s long. BTW, the dictionary I use is called ”デジタル大辞泉2009i” and it&#039;s made by &quot;Shogakukan INC.&quot;.....in case you wanted to know.

みみ【耳】１頭部の左右にあり、聴覚および平衡感覚をつかさどる器官。哺乳類では耳殻（じかく）が張り出し、鳥類とともに外耳•中耳•内耳の3部分からなる。爬虫（はちゅう）類•両生類では中耳•内耳があり、鼓膜が露出。魚類では内耳だけで、平衡器としての働きが大きい。「—まで真っ赤になる」
そう‐じ【掃除】〘名〙スル １掃いたり拭いたりして、塵や埃、汚れなどを取り去ること。「庭を—する」「ふき—」
ほう‐ほう【方法】１目標に達するための手段。目的を遂げるためのやり方。てだて。
おし•える【教える】〘動ア下一〙をし•ふ〘ハ下二〙２知っていることを相手に告げ知らせる。「道を—•える」「花の名所を—•える」

I think it&#039;s usually good to put the source down too. That way if you for some reason don&#039;t understand a sentence due to context or something, you can always go back and see where you got it from.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t suppose anyone out there would be so wonderfully and splendidly willing to make audio snippets of these phrases being said at an approximately native rhythm/stress? I have come across a lot of phrases but, as I&#039;m just beginning, it&#039;s really difficult to look at a random phrase and know how to say it correctly... And as Anki has nice audio accompaniment for its flashcards this would be an excellent combo! 

Cheers!

					<description><![CDATA[How important is the second line in the definition? I&#039;m finding it really hard to translate each word and particle directly without relation to each other. Especially since some words have no English equivalent. It&#039;s basically impossible without looking up grammar rules, and then I end up with confusing messes like this:

&quot;とう・きょう と おお・さか と どちら の ほう が たくさん あめ が ふりますか

Tokyo [and] Osaka [and which] [the way of] [sub. marker] much rain [sub. marker] falls [question]

					<description><![CDATA[faB - PL1 through PL4 indicate politeness level.

PL1 - rude or very colloquial language (use with extreme caution).
PL2 - normal plain speech, often marked by using plain forms of verbs, like &quot;da&quot; instead of &quot;desu&quot;, &quot;aru&quot; instead of &quot;arimasu&quot;, etc.
PL3 - polite speech, the kind foreigners are encouraged to learn first. Often marked by using polite forms like &quot;desu&quot; instead of &quot;da&quot;, etc.
PL4 - very formal/honorific speech, used when addressing superiors and the like. Instead of &quot;desu&quot; you might use &quot;de gozaimasu&quot;, etc.

As an example, I think &quot;doumo&quot; is probably around PL2, &quot;doumo arigatou&quot; is certainly PL3, and &quot;doumo arigatou gozaimasu&quot; is probably around PL4, although I think all three of them are fairly close to PL3. Not having any real command of the language, though, I could be wrong. :)

It&#039;s used to mark the sentence as a whole, not the words used in the sentence. For instance, using a humble verb in reference to yourself may be PL4, but using the same verb in reference to who you&#039;re talking to could be PL1!

I learned this system from &quot;Learn Japanese Through Comics&quot; and related books. I don&#039;t know where else it might be used.

					<description><![CDATA[Q: 教えてくれて有り難う
A: おし・えて　呉れて　あ・り　がと・う (PL2)

I spent ten minutes trying to figure out what 教えてくれて is before noticing the answer section. Is the くれて supposed to be 呉れて? :)]]></description>
