					<description><![CDATA[Does anyone know what keywords I have to search for to get to Japanese websites for lyrics of Japanese Songs?

I would love to learn 素晴らしき日常 by 高橋優, but I cannot catch every word in the song or read/reproduce the respective kanji (although displayed prominently in the 間中-titles, thanks a lot). 
www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5mw8_oG_fM&#038;videos=vDAuLWY8Fck

So I guess it would be less time-consuming for this and following songs to have the correct lyrics and study from there...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I did this with Singuila&#039;s Ma Nature today. It was actually really fun. But he&#039;s right, if it seems boring to you then stop.
 I used Youtube downloader to rip the youtube video, then converted it to a mp3 with the youtube downloader. Then I used audacity to trim each part, and put it into anki with the audio and whatnot with about 3-4 lines per card.  It seems like a lot, but really It took me maybe 45 minutes, and I stopped to take a phone call. Once you know the software (which takes 5 minutes) you can knock it out. 
Now, I just add the full song to my mp3 with the other things and then when I review, it will be familiar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@KREVA  my hiphop-rap-syllable-dense-song-learning-method points.

mix, match, etc these two
* sing or hum with, the whole song
* loop small sections 10-30 second bits and match the sounds

always do these two
* do it every day
* leave it when it&#039;s fun

about lyrics:
Me, I can&#039;t read first and sing every yet.  So I just sing.  Make the sounds of the song a reflex and then I can read and sing.  I use the lyrics to help me clarify sounds, but sometimes they&#039;re no help (typos, creative kanji readings).  

Also, if you&#039;re struggling please don&#039;t blame the song or yourself...though that&#039;s certainly easy, hehe.  It&#039;s the love of the idea inside you that inspires the energy to pursue your dream (like Peter Pan&#039;s happy thought).  So rather than struggle, think, feel, use intuition/imagination.  Separate your mind from the illusion of reality and find the idea(s) that produces the love.

					<description><![CDATA[I use Audio Hijack Pro.  I can rip sound from any source on my computer: Firefox, iTunes, DVD Player... it&#039;s pretty awesome!  While I watch movies or anime on my computer, it&#039;s automatically recording it and creating new files from it every 5 minutes.  You can adjust how much time lapses before it creates new files.

It also has a split feature which is particularly useful for music.  From what I understand, Khatz, the way you do it seems like the audio created for your SRS are random 15-30 second clips.  Which is why you suggest 5 seconds of overlap.  The split feature in Audio Hijack is a lot more convenient, though, I think.  Whenever I click &quot;Split&quot;, it creates a new file from that exact point.  So as I&#039;m listening to/hijacking a song from my iTunes, I click &quot;Split&quot; right before a lyric starts and right after it ends.  This way I can have an audio file of a line (or entire stanza or whatever) in a perfectly packaged form.  Now when I SRS with this audio file, I know it&#039;s going to get right to the point of what I want to learn and also end promptly.

I just have the free demo version of Audio Hijack Pro which is all you will ever need if you&#039;re using it for SRSing.  The free version seems to give you all the features of the regular version, but it limits your hijacking to ten minutes at a time.  Plenty of time for this kind of thing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ah, well glad that works well since that&#039;s really all I listen to...I&#039;ve noticed that japanese rappers that really go off are still pretty slow compared to someone like Do or Die, or Twista...

Also, I think khatz was implying that you would have multiple cards per audio clip to focus on short, discrete bits of info...So, even if you are listening to a song with a good bit of lyrics per sec, you can still break up what your focus on per card actually is]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@kendo

Getting lyrics wasn&#039;t really where I was getting at, just the amount of words a rapper can rap inside of 30 seconds compared to that of a J-POP singer and whether it would be too much for a single SRS card, but all of that is irrelevant now.  I experimented with some hip-hop already and even at 30 seconds a clip, its still a relatively small amount of text for each card.  

Thanks again for this idea, Khatz.  Applying this method to J-Hip-Hop is A-OK. :D]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[lol drewskie what&#039;s sad is how true that actually is... They probably walk away mumbling, &quot;He must have gotten to do a student exchange&quot; or &quot;His parents must have lived in Japan during his formative years,&quot;  but definitely not, &quot;Wow, he must have worked really hard, I bet if I worked hard I could learn some Japanese too.&quot;

Its like writing a novel.  I&#039;ve written four (really, really bad ones) and what I always hear is, &quot;I have a great idea for a novel, if I just had time to write it.&quot;  As if the magical time fairy lived in my apartment or something...  Its not like I didnt have a full time job, school, social life, etc when I wrote those, and the fourth was much, much much better than the first.]]></description>

&quot;[You] have to be careful about how much you like Japan.  If you know how to speak Japanese, you kind of ruin it for everyone else.&quot;

I think I need to apologize to some people I know. Some of them look longingly at the sheet I use to write missed SRS bits, which is filled with Japanese of varying sizes and arrangements. Every once in a while one asks me what something says, and when I tell them they&#039;re like &quot;Nice,&quot; but now I know what they really meant was &quot;You&#039;ve ruined Japan for me.&quot; My bad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatz, thanks for bringing this interesting idea to our attention, but for us who like hip-hop, have you experimented any with this type of genre of music?  I know with J-POP, 30 seconds of music time will get you a line or two in 30 sec., but with hip-hop,  rappers can end up with 5-10 verses in 30 seconds, which seems like it could be tough and tiring from the start.

I&#039;m about to try this idea with some hip-hop, so I just wanted to know if you could recommend any advice that would be relevant to this genre of music.]]></description>
