Yeah I have seen that vid. I was just hoping he might make some more regularly, just chatting about Japan and language learning and whatnot. Casual and rambling. Hikosaemon&#039;s vids are awesome!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah I thought the video was great!
Like a few others said it would be great to have changes in the music, but I know what it&#039;s like to deal with music (copyright issues etc)
Love the content, can&#039;t wait for the more advanced stuff.
I agree it would be cool to have a video in English with Japanese subs, I find this a great way to learn

Maybe one time you could do a colab? The video you did with tokyosam was so good because you had this kinda question and answer thing goin on. If you can find someone who will work for free, might be an idea ;)

Anyways to sum up I&#039;d just say awesome video, but music needs variety. Still, well worth the dosh]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jimbo, in case you or anyone else hasn&#039;t seen it yet, Khatz has already done one rambling video on YouTube in Japanese (albeit sans subtitles). You can check it out here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejRkuX1RGf4

I agree, Japanese and English subs would be prime (like Hikosaemon does). Japanese for the learners and English for those just checking out the site. Come on Khatz, let&#039;s see some more videos! At the very least, it would prove your method works well. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more with Joe: doing just a cool, rambling vid for 10 minutes for YouTube would be a FANTASTIC supplement to the articles on this website. I&#039;d just add, that Japanese subtitles would probably be easier and more effective. After all, the people watching it would be interested in what you&#039;re saying, and so enjoying the Japanese, and in addition they&#039;d have the benefit of having exact subs.

Or maybe this could be a next addition to your &quot;product line&quot;? :D Either way, the folks at YouTube definitely want more vids from you, provided you can find the time and can be bothered, it seems like a really good idea!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great work on this one, Khatz, definitely a huge help for the beginners out there. You should do this video format for your blog posts once in a while too, perhaps in Japanese with English subtitles a la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/Hikosaemon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hikosaemon&lt;/a&gt;. (I hope I did the HTML right!) Once again, thanks for the great stuff you&#039;re doing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Actually, while going through the video again, I would agree largely with what Elliot said: changing the music for each segment/phase would be a nice way to keep things fresh. Keeping it raw though would make it feel a little too...I don&#039;t know, empty I suppose. The music you chose was just right though; it wasn&#039;t overbearing or distracting, but to be fair to what Patrick said, it did get a little repetitive (I actually wrote my first comment before the video through).

Also, as Elliot rightly mentions, possibly having some ability to divide the video into chapters so you can listen to a certain &#039;phase&#039; again for clarification would be really helpful. Overall, the spontaneity of the video was really nice and come to think of it, it really came across as more of a conversation than a presentation which made listening to it, at least for me, a whole lot more enjoyable for the 80 odd minutes it lasts. Really, well done!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great job, Khatz, really good to &quot;see&quot; more of you. Couple things I might mention for revisions or future vids of this sort: (a) video segments, (b) music changes/choices, (c) transitions =]

I am really stoked to get your presentation and video supplement to your QRG, but like this site, there&#039;s a lot of good (great even) info, but it&#039;s packed a little densely and as you recommend with reading, it&#039;s nice to skip around and &quot;go at your own pace.&quot; I think if you broke the portions into identifiable segments of between 2 to 5, to possibly even 10 minutes in each topic/area with some noticeable video transitions (even cheesy &quot;STEP 2&quot; or &quot;Stage 4: sentences part 1- how to begin&quot; black screens with white letters or something) it would really help break up the monotony of 81 minutes.

Secondly, music... perhaps I&#039;ve been gearing/geared up with lots of princeton review and Barron review videos for GRE testing and whatnot, but having some peppy synthy/jazz-pop music in the back ground that is lower in volume, but also helpful in supplementing energy into your segments it would keep things going. 

Now with that criticism, Khatz, really, you&#039;re doing a great job and I&#039;ve appreciated your work and thoughts on language study! To mention one of my favorite PD people, Stephen Covey, don&#039;t forget to take care of your productivity tools and rest up and take&#039;em in for a sharpening =]

All the best,

					<description><![CDATA[I think the music works perfectly well. It&#039;s not death metal, it&#039;s just calm and quiet enough to add a nice ambiance to the whole presentation.

It was rather amusing how you&#039;d crack a joke or something, I&#039;d expect you to laugh and you wouldn&#039;t. Then suddenly moments later you&#039;d burst out laughing. Hilarious.

Anyway, yeah, good video. I&#039;ve already read the site numerous times, but what the hey!]]></description>
