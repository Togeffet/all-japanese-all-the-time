					<description><![CDATA[This blog has been very influential for me in progressing in mandarin. Yup. the Characters!
Thank you, thank you (skip to the end)

I&#039;m a multilingual Frenchie (speak all the usual European suspects + Hindi &#038; Punjabi) but Mandarin Chinese kept kicking my a....$$. I could sound really good and communicate OK, but could never truly get to the other side (which I have done with several other languages).
I was illiterate and didn&#039;t understand the implications. I had found your blog and had even started to do the 10,000 sentences in pinyin, and then..... I .... stopped.

 I..  listened... to you and  I started doing James Heisig&#039;s &quot;Remembering the Hanzi&quot;. I broke 1000 very quickly and  I am going at it full tilt boogie till I hit 3000.
It really is starting to make the language come together for me (since I know a lot of Mandarin already, and have the tonal system and phonetics down). I can&#039;t wait to start reading on the internet books, movies etc.  (gettin&#039;close!!) 
When I hear words I already know, the character is now popping up and the understanding is somehow different. 

Steve kaufman&#039;s lingq&#039;s (recordings with texts)  also kick major butt to help develop comprehension. I often slow the recordings down 15%-30% using  Audacity freeware. That helps a friggin lot (tempo but not pitch).

So this is a wordy thank you thank you thank you post.  Keep up the amazing work.
Sucking a little less is an admirable concept.
All in funn.

					<description><![CDATA[Einar-
Maybe two detractors from using premade flashcards.  1) you lose some control over what&#039;s in the deck.  I.e., it makes it more difficult to add fun stuff pertinent to your own interests. 2) you lose the initial review time involved with entering a new card into the deck.  

The largest benefit is that you can do more reps, since you don&#039;t have to worry about the other stuff.  So, as long as you can maintain interest and are having fun with the material, I&#039;d say go for it.

I use both premade and self-made.  Often I find that in the time it took me to enter a new card, I remember the material, and then quickly get bored with the card.  So, in many cases, I enjoy the premade cards better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good evening Khatzumoto-sama. I have been reading this site for a month or soo and my japanese has benefitted imensly. The SRS i use is smart.fm which has premade flashcards. Is this in any way inferior to making up your own sentences and putting them into mnemosyne or the like?

					<description><![CDATA[Hi AJATT community!

I&#039;ve got a question for y&#039;all - recently (1 year ago) I&#039;ve started learning Spanish and since I&#039;m getting better in it  (or at least I hope so)  every day I&#039;ve noticed a funny thing - I&#039;m loosing my ability to write proper English words! I&#039;m mean, my spelling is horrible and I&#039;m even starting to change the ending of some verbs like in Spanish. 

Can anyone think of a cure for this? 

(English is my 2nd language, but still, I would like to write it in a proper way.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love it...this is my favorite series that you&#039;ve posted.  It reassures me that the method(s) (cus I sure change it up everyday lol) I&#039;m doing is OK.  I still occasionally open a book and study the grammar but everyday I listen to Japanese music (and print out the kanji lyrics which is great for me to remember some kanji!) and have shows/movies playing in the background.  Sometimes I wish I was exposed to it more at work but its a tad bit too busy for me.  Then again I shouldn&#039;t make an excuse.  I&#039;ll start posting lil notes around my desk with kanji or something.  Anyway, ブログエントリーはいいです! ^_^]]></description>
