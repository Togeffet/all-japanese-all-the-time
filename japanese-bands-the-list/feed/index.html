					<description><![CDATA[Too add to this:

Non sucky jpop and light jrock:
Most of my favs are rock/pop-rock, apart from Kreva (rapper). I’ll give you a sample:

Scandal, pop-rock all girl band who work super hard but make super fun music: www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEkerSi5Fig
www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EDvabyo620

Sheena Ringo, awesome genius singer songwriter and multiple instrumentalist who makes some sort of powerpop-rock sometimes jazzy too:
www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECxBHhMc7oI
www.youtube.com/watch?v=M55uRP4DWW0

Tokyo Jihen, jazz/rock band fronted by Sheena Ringo: www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTKwzRAdY7w

School Food Punishment… I don’t know how to describe it really… nice, not weird, just not very conducive to words:

					<description><![CDATA[If you like metal you should check out Dir en grey, especially their new album, Dum Spiro Spero. It&#039;s gotta be one of the darkest albums I&#039;ve heard. If you like metalish/rock (more upbeat, mostly smooth vocals but with a good bit of screaming), I recommend DELUHI (my favorite, awesome singing, badass guitarist, badass drummer, badass bassist, badass composition), Deathgaze, lynch., etc. If you like power/speed/neo-classical metal, Galneryus has to be the best ever. Escrew Dragonforce. If you like plain rock (96% clean vocals, no blast beats, etc) try the GazettE, Kaggra, Alice Nine, SPYAIR (awesome band), Malice Mizer, Moi dix Moix (they&#039;re Japanese, I swear!), Nightmare (did the first or second intro/outro for Death Note), and a whole lot of other bands I didn&#039;t mention.

Plus, most of those bands are Visual Kei, which is always something cool to look at. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Be forewarned that all of the links are to awesome American, English-language bands. As in too awesome to resist. If anyone knows a Japanese equivalent, please tell me.(I&#039;ll never learn Japanese at this rate, I love these bands too much)
Does anybody know any bands like this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnfyjwChuNU&#038;ob=av2n
(Red Hot Chili Peppers-By the Way)
or this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUL8dEroAY4
(Metallica-Fade to Black)
I&#039;m seriously getting tired of visual kei and i need my metal fix!!!
Also any like this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQtZVlf3zzo
(Sevendust-Separate)

To add to the list: 
Kenichi Asai(浅井健一）he&#039;s an older guy, with a bit of an older rock style. But a good one.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_2xdL-CByI
Younha-- a Korean artist who found fame in Japan, and is now famous in Korea as well. She sings in Japanese, Korean, and English(sometimes in one song, usually not)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOZHK6AWH_E
Ajikan and Yui are great. 
Gackt is well loved, but he&#039;s really hit or miss for me. He also has a very widely-ranging style, so even if you don&#039;t like one song, you&#039;ll find another one you do like. links are below.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OrqyUgelU
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23qTT2_vW8s
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3Uw9YClm2E
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4plEI-mdOA

Help me on my quest for good J-rock! 
By the way, though I like Gackt I don&#039;t like visual kei, so please recommend bands that are NOT visual kei. Thanks.

Ajikan and Yui are great.<br />
Gackt is well loved, but he&#8217;s really hit or miss for me. He also has a very widely-ranging style, so even if you don&#8217;t like one song, you&#8217;ll find another one you do like. links are below.<br />

<p>Help me on my quest for good J-rock!<br />
By the way, though I like Gackt I don&#8217;t like visual kei, so please recommend bands that are NOT visual kei. Thanks.<br />

					<description><![CDATA[I was checking back here for replies when I realized that I probably sounded like a jerk saying that...it&#039;s not that the artists aren&#039;t worth the money, it&#039;s that I&#039;m 14 without a job and I literally cannot afford to pay that much. :P If anybody knows where I could buy the mp3s, I&#039;d really appreciate it if they could share.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Khatz, 
Thanks so much for the list! I was just wondering, where do you buy your music? I use iTunes but it doesn&#039;t have a huge selection of Japanese artists. Other places I&#039;ve seen ask as much as $40 or $60 to ship you the actual CD (when it still only has around 15 songs). I&#039;d still like to support the artists, but I think $40 is a little too much support than I&#039;m willing to dish out.

Thanks.]]></description>
