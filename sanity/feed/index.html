					<description><![CDATA[I feel compelled to point out that the Wright Brothers weren&#039;t from North Carolina, they were from Ohio.  North Carolina just happened to be a remote work site for their flying experiments.  I grew up in their hometown, so I&#039;ve heard about them ad nauseum since I was knee high to a grasshopper.

Speaking of the Wright Bros, however, you might be interested to know that they considered their first &quot;successful&quot; flight in North Carolina to be a failure.  They returned home completely dejected, but ready to start over.  When they decided to set up shop and do most of their experiments locally, the townspeople thought they were crazy.  All of the &quot;sane&quot; people told them they couldn&#039;t do it, that &quot;if man were meant to fly, he&#039;d have been born with wings.&quot;  But those &quot;crazy Wright boys&quot; didn&#039;t give up, working in all kinds of weathers, having to dodge cows in their flying field, and constantly having to rebuild and recover from crashes.

And do you know what I find awesome about the whole story (tying this whole thing back into AJATT and methods)?  The Wright Brothers didn&#039;t go to college, and I think one of them didn&#039;t even finish high school, but not having &quot;credentials&quot; didn&#039;t stop them from being successful.  Their methods weren&#039;t entirely their own, but they learned from others&#039; mistakes and improved on them to make something that worked.  Their major turning point came when they figured out that a fundamental principle (might have been physics or math or something, I can&#039;t remember exactly what it was) that everyone else in the world had been using as a basis for their calculations was WRONG.  Suddenly they were operating on a different playing field, and this paradigm shift led them along the path to greatness.  And the rest, as they say, is history.

Methods change.  Ideas change.  S### happens.  Don&#039;t sweat it.  The most important part is just not to give up because something isn&#039;t working the way you thought it would.  I&#039;ve been following AJATT for just over two years now, and I&#039;ve loved (almost) every minute of it.  Thanks Khatz.  I&#039;m flying :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure, but I think this whole comment rating system is getting a little out of hand. Like, this person (PB) just stated his/her interpretation of things, yet this comment is hidden due to poor ratings. I&#039;m not sure why opinions that are unpopular should be hidden or marked as bad. Wasn&#039;t Darwin&#039;s opinion on nature unpopular? In fact, wasn&#039;t the idea of AJATT originally unpopular?

					<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m missing the point when I say this, but isn&#039;t saying, &quot;We fly&quot; in this context sort of like being in a boat and saying, &quot;We swim&quot;? I know I&#039;m knit picking here, but what seems more interesting to me is the fact that instead of trying to fly themselves (like that guy who made himself a pair of wings to flap), some smart people decided to make a machine that did the flying for them. 
¬†
&lt;em&gt;Let&#039;s stop trying to fly, and just build a machine to do the flying for us.&lt;/em&gt; I think that sort of outside the box - and perhaps even lazy - type of thinking may be a beneficial way to look at learning Japanese as well.¬†
¬†
[Note: when I say &quot;some smart people&quot;, I&#039;m not referring specifically to the Wright brothers. As far as I know, mechanical flight was a concept created before their plane, they just happened to be the first to make it all work.]]]></description>

I know I&#8217;m knit picking here, but what seems more interesting to me is the fact that instead of trying to fly themselves (like that guy who made himself a pair of wings to flap), some smart people decided to make a machine that did the flying for them.<br />
¬†<br />
<em>Let&#8217;s stop trying to fly, and just build a machine to do the flying for us.</em> I think that sort of outside the box &#8211; and perhaps even lazy &#8211; type of thinking may be a beneficial way to look at learning Japanese as well.¬†<br />

[Note: when I say &#8220;some smart people&#8221;, I&#8217;m not referring specifically to the Wright brothers. As far as I know, mechanical flight was a concept created before their plane, they just happened to be the first to make it all work.]</p>

But yes, I find this post very helpful. I&#039;ve always changed my ways of doing sentences and stuff, and then I&#039;m like, &quot;Why didn&#039;t I just do this from the start!?&quot; and get a little frustrated with myself, but in the end, we always find better ways to do stuff. Even when I reach my dream of Japanese pwnage and moving to Japan, I&#039;ll still probably find a better way to learn than I did. 
Same thing with planes, We mastered flying quite a while ago, but we always build on top of it on how to make it even better.]]></description>
