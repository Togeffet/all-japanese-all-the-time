					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re aiming for &quot;perfection&quot; you&#039;ll never get there because nobody is perfect. I am sure you don&#039;t speak your native language perfectly either, so don&#039;t worry. :)
Maybe you can read manga already but you aren&#039;t able to read books with ease yet. That&#039;s fine, just keep using the language every day and don&#039;t forget to have fun!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think part of that could be habit, it&#039;s what they were used to, but I think it&#039;s mostly the fact that the human mind by design seems to make the past seem better than it really was (unearned nostalgia is a very real thing). The way I see it, there are some things for everyone that we can do to make the journey itself rewarding, like language learning for us on this site. I doubt that these girls enjoyed the millions of minutes reaching their triumph, and I have my own triumphs that when I really think about it didn&#039;t justify the unhappy road to them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately with these success stories doubt starts to seep in for me. I sometimes get the feeling &quot;sure THAT guy could reach fluency but what if I never get there? What if I&#039;m the exception? After all I was never good with school / I have ADD / blahblahblah&quot;. And over time it starts to wear on me a little, like it&#039;s the elephant in the room I try to keep ignoring. I gotta say though a bit of my doubts have been eased with this series of posts. I&#039;m at the intermediate stage myself and I can relate to pretty much everything in this series.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;You spend millions of minutes to reach one triumph, one moment, then you spend maybe a thousand minutes enjoying it. If you were unhappy through those millions of minutes, what good is the thousand minutes of triumph?&quot;

This part intrigues me. It does so because I keep hearing stories of people who achieved success through pain and tears, usually either because someone (usually their parents) forced them to or they forced themselves. And often the story would end with them saying they wouldn&#039;t have done it any other way. 

For example, I read Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother - she forced her daughters from very young age to play piano and to learn to play as quickly as possible. Obviously the two of them became VERY good at it eventually. And while the younger daughter ended up rebelling against the training, they both said at the end that they were grateful for what their mother put them through.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Philosophically speaking, a great post! Lots of good points. It took me 1.2yrs to finish RTK1. I did it with a full-time job, wife, son, etc. After finishing 1/2 the book, which coincidentally seems about where most people have this epiphany, I just stopped caring for the end and holy shit did the end come, and fast! Just like, oh wait... nm.

Sometimes, now, when I TRY and read an [Japanese] article, I struggle.
When I JUST read an article, I flow right through it.
