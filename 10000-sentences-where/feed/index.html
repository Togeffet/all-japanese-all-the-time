					<description><![CDATA[So when you are sentence mining for your flashcards you already (in theory) have learned how to read and write the most common Kanji from the Heisig method which should cover most of what you need to know. But what do you do when you come across a new kanji sentence mining? Do you 1) keep doing exactly the same thing and learn the writing by copying the sentence out ect or 2) create a separate kanji flashcard and come up with your own mnemonic like in the Heisig stage?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For exposure purposes (immersion); you must avoid the subs and translations even if you are clueless as to what they are saying you will understand them anyhow since you are getting visual cues; therefore if you are a complete beginner- watch purely movies for exposure- take a pass on written literature for now- you will probably learn the grammars and understand some of those soon enough - but let me ask you this (if you are not a native english speaker) you used to enjoy english cartoons as a kid althogh you probably don&#039;t understand around 80% of the words! But you get better because you never cared! Do that with stuff in your target language! just watch/read them even if you dont understand everything just enjoy everything you can enjoy about it!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[¡ESTUPENDO! By the way where I came from- jap anime is very popular. You could get a complete series of DVD bluray imitation of any anime you want from Dragon ball, cooking master, Boy, Naruto, Bleach, Lucky Samurai X, Lucky Star, You name it! Each for less than a buck if you convert the currency- you might say I am better off learning Japanese instead since some of those like YUYU hakusho, Slam dunk, and Hajime no Ippo I have already watched in our native language version (on local TV) for like TEN times!
Right now I am actually watching them in Spanish version – too bad there aren’t any pirated Spanish DVDs here – I had to download them on youtube. 
But Katz-what is your take on using Animes for Exposure in language learning? I know you’re into manga but what about Animes?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m currently learning Kanji and after reading this post it got me thinking.
Wouldn&#039;t Visual Novels be perfect for this purpose?
Most Visual Novels are voiced and written, and you can go easily 20-30 hours with one.
Fate/Stay Night for example. It took me over 100h to play everything and I&#039;m thinking of replaying it after I&#039;m done with the Kanji because I only played it with an translation patch. But those old and VN&#039;s are pretty pricey. I got lucky and got a really good copy for 70$ from ebay 4 years ago.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Khatzumoto, I am looking for sentences, but I cannot read a good amount of them.
So my question is, how much kanji should I learn before looking up sentences and how would I understand the sentences?
I already know Hiragana and Katakana, so I can sound out most sentences but cannot understand them, how do you suppose I understand them? Should I learn more first in terms of listening ? Should I use a dictionary with english to find the sentence meanings? What is a good Idea to do while picking out sentences in terms of finding their meanings?]]></description>

If you&#039;re wanting a new book or manga but don&#039;t know what exactly, go browse the websites of major publishers (i.e. 電撃 or 角川)  Most have an option to preview the first few pages -- look for a link like 立ち読みはこちら.  (Note that the reader for 電撃 will require a download.)

					<description><![CDATA[A note about operating systems in Japanese. If you are a linux user, most linux distributions offer the option of changing the systems locale even after installation, which changes, things like the menu bar, options/error dialog, and such in X applications. While you may change the system&#039;s locale globally,it&#039;s a better idea to make the change locally to ensure that other users&#039; interface will remain the same.

In order to change a user&#039;s locale you must first enable the locale. Please refer to your distribution&#039;s documentation about how to do this. The next step is distrbution agnostic. Simply add the following line to your .bashrc or .bashprofile
export LANG=foo
where &quot;foo&quot; is the name of your locale (mine is jp＿JP.utf8 so my line is export LANG=jp＿JP.utf8).
Once you do this simple log in and out and VIOLA! Your X applications are now in Japanese

Please note that changing your locale will not change the language of an application if it was not compiled with/or does not support UTF8/Japanese fonts]]></description>
