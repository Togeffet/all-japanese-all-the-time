					<description><![CDATA[Having read some of your posts around here, I don&#039;t think you should be giving advice, 星空.

Also, Khatz has a notoriously kanji-heavy writing style. I think it&#039;s fine because it&#039;s exactly that: a style. With English we don&#039;t get that kind of choice, so I think our initial reaction is to think it&#039;s a little strange, but I don&#039;t think it is----uncommon sure, but not strange.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[dick, you really need an editor.
1)you use too maqny kanji that are used not よくbut あんまり　だってばよ！
eg.無い　有る

1.5)NO ONE uses the kanji for this &#038; that, except maybe kagrra,
(but that&#039;s b/c that band uses heian poetry as a baseline)
　
2)furigana don&#039;t extend their bounds!
if you wrote &quot;来ないで&quot; 　you don&#039;t write こないで　 but just こ　
b/c the ないで is already on the page

3) since when is &quot;pedantic” beginner vocabulary? 全く、お前

私、己の漫画を書き描いてるしそんなこと知ってるのよ。

ほら！事と書かなかったぜ！普通な者達、あの漢字をあんまり使んないぞ。

本当に、この漫画を直しなさい。]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been enjoying reading this site quite a bit, but quite a bit of the kanji being used in this book is highly irregular. If you want to become &quot;native-like&quot; in your Japanese, then why would you practice writing (or reading) the kanji for これ or それ? (And if you&#039;re using the kanji for those, then why not also do あれ and どれ?) And why would you teach いい as 好い, which is not even remotely a common representation. 良い would be more common, but usually that&#039;s read よい. いい is rarely written with kanji. All of these make you stick out as a 外人 like a sore thumb.

I guess maybe it comes from learning your first several hundred sentences from dictionary examples, which use archaic kanji much more commonly (at least for the entry words) than typical running text does?]]></description>
