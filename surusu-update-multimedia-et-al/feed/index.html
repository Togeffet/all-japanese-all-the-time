					<description><![CDATA[Is there any chance of getting img tags working again? At least in my opinion, having an image displayed directly on the card would be a lot more beneficial than having a link to an image opening in a different tab. Not only would it be better for workflow, I think seeing both image and what it depicts in the same plane of vision would help the meaning soak in better.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[okay, I feel really stupid but I need to ask after spending at least a day on this site trying to find my answer without success. There is so much content that I&#039;m totally lost. I&#039;m getting really frustrated.
Is it me? I created an account in Surusu and...... now what?
It looks like the first step is to learn Kanji, so I downloaded the PDF of RTK from one of the links. Do I follow that PDF and practice writing them or is that what Surusu is for. Am I supposed to buy the RTK book?
How do I get started in Surusu. It appears that I have to load files into it. Where do I obtain these files from?
And then comes the sentences. I take it I have to load sentences into this Surusu thing? How do I do this. 
OMG. Am I that dumb? Any help?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have been using Surusu more and more over the last couple of weeks, and overall I find it great. I have used Supermemo and many other SRS systems over the years, but this one really works the best.

I have one question, though. The &quot;this item may be wasting your time&quot; message does not follow any rational I can figure out. It sometimes shows up for cards I&#039;m repeating a lot, and sometimes on cards I hardly see, and other times when I have no idea what the frequency is.

I appreciate that it&#039;s just offering a suggestion, but without any sense of why it gets attached to any one card, it&#039;s hard to assess how worthwhile it is to give it any consideration.

Can you enlighten us as to how and why some cards trigger this alert message?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I may switch over to this. Currently I&#039;ve been using Anki, but its annoying since I have to carry a stupid USB drive everywhere I go to carry my deck in. Its a bit annoying. Plus SuRuSu has a cooler name, plus it tells you if an item may be wasting your time which is pretty awesome. Also it seems just closer to the motivation (this site)... And it has cool little doodles. I&#039;ll have to re add everything, is there a way to somehow add my deck over to SuRuSu? This may be a loooong process.

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The initial problem was that the added items did not show up immediately in the reps and thus didn&#039;t get integrated into the system. I don&#039;t have that problem anymore, however, there&#039;s a chunk of items I added which seem to never show up. Newer items shows up, but the ones that I added that time did&#039;t and still don&#039;t. I think it&#039;s about 4-5 days ago I added them, maybe even a week.

-The initial problem I had is solved.
-There&#039;s still this chunk of items in there that don&#039;t show up no matter what I do.]]></description>
