					<description><![CDATA[Be sure to remember Heisig&#039;s comparison of RtK to a scaffolding with which you learn to actually use kanji. Don&#039;t worry about forcing keywords into actual words; it&#039;s supposed to fade naturally over time, to the point where it&#039;ll actually feel strange, even difficult to go back and force a keyword on a kanji. 

For example, when I see Êó•, I don&#039;t think &quot;day&quot;. I think of¬†Êó•Êú¨„ÄÅ„ÅäÊó•Êßò„ÄÅÂúüÊõúÊó•„ÄÅ‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÂñÑ„ÄÅetc. etc. A large amount of words and phrases overlap with Êó•, so much so that the hook they all originally latched onto, &quot;day&quot;, is no longer relevant. You could also think of it as a building: You lay foundation so you can build a house over it, not so you can admire the concrete.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should certainly not think &#039;negative bright&#039; or &#039;exertion strong&#039; when looking at ‰∏çÊòé and ÂãâÂº∑... you should be thinking „Åµ„ÇÅ„ÅÑ and „Åπ„Çì„Åç„Çá„ÅÜ and their meanings, which seems to be what you&#039;re doing. And of course, if someone puts the proverbial gun to your head (or your flashcards have English answers on them) then you should think &#039;uncertain&#039; and &#039;study&#039; or whatever your favorite short equivalents are. RTK is a memory exercise to create a mental box for each kanji. Once you have a few real words for each kanji you can forget the keyword and have no reason to care - it&#039;s not a definition, it&#039;s not a vocabulary word the kanji can mean, it&#039;s just a mnemonic to let you remember the kanji you need to read Japanese long enough to learn how to read Japanese. The real words -should- replace the artificial keywords.
If, on the other hand, you are forgetting the keywords for kanji that you do not have any vocabulary for ... then you may be getting yourself into trouble, but it sounds like what you have is the natural replacement of mnemonics with real understanding.

(This is also why you were supposed to only drill keyword-&#062;kanji and not vice versa - so that you could more easily attach correct meanings to kanji when you look at them and not have to &#039;unlearn&#039; the keyword. Your keyword-&#062;kanji retention ought to last pretty well, but there&#039;s no way your kanji-&#062;keyword retention would stand any chance at all against the onslaught of real words taking up residence on that mental tag if you&#039;re actually reading every day.)

					<description><![CDATA[I have a question on a matter that is quite serious to me. I don&#039;t know how, but somehow I managed to forget too many Kanji. I mean, when I do reviews, Honestly...I get probably 40-50% wrong. I&#039;ve been on sentences for around 6 months. Has this ever happened to anybody before? It&#039;s really been worrying me, and I don&#039;t know what to do about it. I&#039;ve been wondering if I should just go back to square 1 and just start from RTK1 again. 
¬†
For anybody who&#039;s far enough in sentences in Japanese, has this happened to you? I mean, when you read something like ‰∏çÊòé, you don&#039;t think &quot;Negative bright&quot;, you think „ÅØ„Å£„Åç„ÇäÂàÜ„Åã„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ‰∫ã„ÄÇ Or ÂãâÂº∑, you don&#039;t think &quot;Exertion strong.&quot; Should I still be able to remember the heisig keywords for kanji?
If I have to start from square 1, I will, But I don&#039;t want to make any decision unless I am sure I need to fix it.
