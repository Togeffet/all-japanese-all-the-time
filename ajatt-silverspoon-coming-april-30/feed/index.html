					<description><![CDATA[Your brain is the best dictionary. It&#039;s much faster, even though people will laugh at your English interpretations, in your mind, you know that you KNOW more than they do, because they&#039;re translating &quot;perfectly&quot; (i.e. crappily)

Just keep reading. Shounen Manga is the best tool, because there are a variety of writers with different stories and different situations with different needs. There are readings of the kanji and anyone, young, old, man, woman, robot, can relate to shounen manga. 

People often relate Shounen Manga to (Young boy&#039;s manga) but it&#039;s a lot deeper than that. The Shounen heart is inside all of us. It is our passion for life, it is what burns in the night when all is dim. It is our inner child. It is.

I actually think this &quot;young&quot; manga is more mature than most of those &quot;mature audience&quot; manga]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the thing, you just got to get into the meat and potatoes of Japanese. Don&#039;t worry that you don&#039;t know anything. Just play. Things will eventually start to click.
When I started I had a lot of trouble looking up things, too. I didn&#039;t know what were words and what were phrases. I often misheard syllables which made finding definitions impossible because I was looking for words that didn&#039;t exist or I was trying to look up a few words thinking it was one word which doesn&#039;t work either. Very frustrating. When you are stumped you just gotta shelf it and eventually it will pop up again in another situation later, maybe one that makes the definition more clear. Often times you&#039;ll realize how stupid you were before and wonder why you didn&#039;t see what it was in the first place. The more you are in the language, the easier you&#039;ll notice the patterns.
And ahndoruuu is right, sometimes you won&#039;t even know the literal translation when you hear/use a phrase, nor will you need it. The situation will happen and naturally you&#039;ll pop out the phrase just because it feels right, because you&#039;ve heard it many times in a situation similar before. I actually think it&#039;s better to just go with gut feelings on what a word/phrase means so it doesn&#039;t get garbled with English meanings. 
In this case, though, to find definitions, the split would be &#039;なん&#039; from &#039;だろう&#039;. なん, another form of なに, meaning &#039;what&#039;; and だろう, another form of でしょう, a tag that adds a degree of uncertainty. So, &quot;[I] wonder what [it] could be&quot; is the general meaning here.
...Or, something like that. I&#039;m no expert of explanation. (笑)
Hope that helps. : ]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To be honest, I don&#039;t even know what it means.  I just know when and how to use it.  Recently I&#039;ve been realizing how little I actually know about the meanings of words, even in my native language, and it&#039;s quite surprising.

					<description><![CDATA[*Actually, I think my problem in learning what specific words mean is that I&#039;m using crappy online dictionaries to try to translate them into English... I&#039;ve done this with sentences too, and it never works out very well. Seems like it&#039;ll be hard to build a decent foundation of Japanese vocabulary at this rate.

&quot;Nandarou&quot; always comes up with no results, as do 90% of the things I attempt, regardless of whether it&#039;s in romaji or kana. Guess I&#039;ll just have to go with my assumption that it means something similar to &quot;what.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been wondering what this word means for a few months now... Sadly, have yet to actually look it up. /islazeh

*sigh* I&#039;m getting fairly close to being done with RTK 1, but I know next to nothing of the language. Definitely need to get this immersion environment thing going - my problem is that I usually play games for entertainment when I should be doing RTK, but I&#039;m playing them in English. This is a problem because I could definitely be playing them in Japanese, but I no comprende and feel that Japanese would take all of the enjoyment out of them. :/

So in short, need to get over the no-comprende problem and just do things in Japanese all the time. But getting myself to do this is going to be difficult...]]></description>
