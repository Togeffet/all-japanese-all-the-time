					<description><![CDATA[HI 
Thanks for all the tips on language learning. 
Unfortunately, I cant seem to get the FNN news site to work consistently, does anyone know any other websites which play japanese news?? 
Ideally ones that have the script written below the video/voice recording.

Thanks a lot]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[khatzumoto,

How do you explain as native speakers we understand what&#039;s said on the news without previous exposure to it. I personally hate news programs, but it doesn&#039;t mean i cannot understand them. Does it give the proves that as second language learners we&#039;d eventually understand the news programs in our L2 even without being exposed to it, not to mention the quantity of the exposure? Looking forward to hearing what you think of this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, 

First of all, thank you for this site. It is most helpful. 
I would like to listen to the yomiuri podcasts but it seems that we need to be registered. As the site web is in Japanese (not my level...yet),do you know how to proceed? 

Thanks a lot

					<description><![CDATA[Hi All!

First I&#039;d like to say that my friend who just started as a JET recently pointed me to this site and it has completely redefined the way I think about learning Japanese, especially after taking it for two years in college.

That being said,  I currently have my immersion environment rollin&#039;.  I am doing the Heisig Kanji but also some sentences because of my previous experience.  Anyways, here is my main concern: Accurate News Translations.  I see the transcripts on the sites mentioned above; however, I want to make sure I get the grammar correct.  Any tips?  

Thanks!

					<description><![CDATA[One thing I&#039;d have to recommend:
If you want to become fluent at reading the newspaper, then it&#039;s best to combine sentences from FNN/TTS with news articles from newspaper websites like:
http://www.asahi.com
http://www.yomiuri.co.jp

The content of actual newspaper articles is far more expansive then news reports. I&#039;ve made the effort to make half of my sentences from newspaper articles everyday, and its benefited me enormously in reading the newspaper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been  using this method for the past month and a half now, listening to the news 24-7 and inputting about 30 sentences every day. I can read the newspaper and understand the news on the first time about 80%. Freakin&#039; love the news.
I&#039;m dropping all other Japanese focuses and am going absolutely &#039;hard core&#039; at the news for the next 2 weeks so I can wrap it up and move on.
Of course, I&#039;ll pick up a newspaper every now and then and mine some sentences I don&#039;t understand, but the news is only one part of Japanese, and the vocab is endless.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] I think that both massive exposure and SRS content are important to balance out somehow. SRS is a type of exposure, but not quite as good as hours of intensive audio and video content. But your SRS content is a focused tool that will help you quickly increase your vocabulary, which will let you get even more benefit from the hours of intensive audio and video. Therefore, i think these two strategies go well together, as advocated by Khatsumoto on his All Japanese All The Time site.

But for the life of me, i can not find these transcripts!!!

Where are they? So i can have written confirmation of what I am listening to?

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I agree completely with Tyler. I have used Audacity for all my sound needs, including editing, and I love how well and simple it works.

Thank you Khatz for the great article!! I am really excited to try your method. How much of your blog do you recommend reading before starting hardcore Heisig Kanji learning? So far I have about 50 or so learned.

Also, thanks everyone for the news links because where I live we have only one public TV station that broadcasts Japanese Television, and thats only on Saturday nights! :(]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@steffen (and anybody wanting to record streaming audio):

Unless I&#039;m misunderstanding, you can do the same thing for free with Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net) by recording with the Stereo Mix option. (on Windows, make sure it&#039;s enabled for your sound card). The downside is it&#039;s realtime so you have to listen to all of it while you&#039;re recording all of it. 

Btw thanks for such a great site Khatz! :D]]></description>
