					<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t forget about the utility of action. Action almost always has more utility than doing nothing. With the time lost, energy spent, and usefulness of the things gained, action will always be better than inaction. 
If you fail at your action, you will have learned something and be better prepared for your next action; if you succeed you will have the exact same; if you do nothing, you&#039;ll have wasted your time and gained nothing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agreed completely, just pick something and go.  Don&#039;t worry about whether it&#039;s the best way or not, you can sort that out later, what matters more is simply doing &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;, taking &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; action of some sort.

Not making a decision &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a decision - you&#039;ve decided not to act.

Cheers,
Andrew]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unlike Khatz I don&#039;t know many ways to get things done, but there is one sure way to not do something- not doing it. The best way to not do it is never even start it in the first place. And finally, to never even start it you have to stop thinking about it. Belive me it works 99.999...% of the time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Failure many times over leads to success. Bad ideas are meant to be fun though! I actually can&#039;t think of something I&#039;ve done recently that I would consider a bad idea. Let&#039;s see... I spoke to a bunch of girls at school in Japanese by myself and made loads of mistakes... good idea. I finished pokemon white all in Japanese... good idea. I volunteered to teach Japanese highschool students about Australian culture... good idea. I watched a bunch of T.V, some of which was boring, some of which was interesting... good idea. I downloaded a free anki deck and started doing pre-packaged sentence reps... good idea. I started making MCD&#039;s, I didn&#039;t know how to make them properly but I started anyway... good idea, I now know how this MCD thing works.

The only bad idea&#039;s I&#039;ve had have been lack of ideas, and therefore lack of action. 続け活動がなしの時間.]]></description>
